It was returned on 1 August.</p><p>Brooks explained that one of the four ideas for books was a \"slight rip off\" of 84 Charing Cross Road. \"The concept was a Hooray Henry had fallen in love with a Russian hooker. He didn't realise she was a hooker. Behaviourally, she had the temperament of a nice Roedean girl,\" he said to much laughter. Mr Justice Saunders cut it and after a brief exchange with Neil Saunders, Brooks's defence counsel, he said: \"I'm just trying to keep it vaguely relevant.\"</p><p>Another book idea was a take on the classic Mrs Beeton housekeeping book. \"I thought the perfect wife should know the offside and the LBW [leg before wicket] rule instead of knowing how to iron sheets and make flower arrangements\"</p><p>In full swing, Brooks went on to describe another idea was a kind of Bill Bryson book about horses, before being interrupted again by the judge.</p><p>He then volunteered that there was \"smut\" on the computer as well. \"I was a bachelor for much of this time, I think it's fair to say there was quite a lot of smut on it as well.\"</p><p>Earlier in the trial, which has now being going for five months, the jury heard that among the possessions he hid behind the bins were pornographic DVDs and a magazine.</p><p>Brooks prompted chuckling in court as he chronicled his chequered education and career, which included a \"dreadful column\" in the London Evening Standard before he met Rebekah Brooks.</p><p>He told jurors he had done OK at O-levels, but not so well at A-level exams in chemistry, biology and geography.</p><p>\"I wanted to be a farmer,\" he said, explaining why he chose chemistry. But he failed his exam getting an O-level instead of an A-level, \"which was pretty poor\" after studying the subject for two years, he said.</p><p>He then \"ridculously optimistically applied to Oxford [University], but they declined to have me\" and shortly after became a stable lad in a yard in Lambourne and after six months was \"lucky enough to slide my way into Fred Winter's yard\". Winter was a champion race horse-trainer.</p><p>After a period of mucking out and riding out on the gallops, he got a chance to become a jockey and by 1997 he rode a winner at Cheltenham, though Winter was not impressed.</p><p>That year he also got a chance to ride in the Grand National, \"which was the pinnacle of my life really and I got around [the course] which was even better.\"</p><p>Brooks went on to buy the Winters yard on a large mortgage, a decision he described as \"foolish\" as interest rates were low and had given him a false sense of security about affordability.</p><p>He later got into writing. His first stint was at the Evening Standard, where he said he wrote a \"dreadful column\". \"I looked back on a couple of them the other day and they were shocking,\" he added.</p><p>Brooks said he had more luck at the Telegraph, where he had a racing column for 10 years and a Country Life column which lasted a year. \"I really hated doing this.\"</p><p>A stint at GQ followed, which he ended because there were too many deadlines and it was \"killing any creative bone in my body\". Another job at City Am ensued with a racing tips column which gave him a taste of \"what a complicated job\" his wife had as he tried to self-fund it through advertising.</p><p>There was laughter in court as Brooks continued to his next failed venture – a pub in Lambourne which he bought with \"someone called Johnny the Fish\". \"After about a year, I worked out why he was called Johnny the Fish.\"</p><p>Asked by Saunders if a foray into cryotherapy business for sports injuries had worked, Brooks replied flatly: \"No. Not as a business, the nitrogen was too expensive.\"</p><p>Another idea that turned out to be too expensive was a scheme to sleep in enclosures with reduced oxygen so \"we would all be more intelligent.\"</p><p>While Brooks was regaling the jury with his business escapades, Rebekah Brooks smiled broadly, occasionally looking up to the public gallery where his mother Caroline and sister Annabel were sitting.</p><p>Brooks has been charged along with six others, including his wife and several security staff, with conspiring to pervert the course of justice by concealing documents, computers and other electronic equipment from Scotland Yard detectives investigating allegations of phone hacking. He denies the charges.</p><p>The trial continues</p>","headline":"Hacking trial: hidden laptops held book drafts, Charlie Brooks says","trailText":"Rebekah Brooks's husband tells court about content on computers and the concepts for books he was working on","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396013489190/Charlie-Brooks-003.jpg","wordcount":"903","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-31T12:47:29Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/28/phone-hacking-trials-computers-book-drafts-smut-charlie-brooks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/28/phone-hacking-trials-computers-book-drafts-smut-charlie-brooks","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lisaocarroll","webTitle":"Lisa O'Carroll","rcsId":"GNL004691","r2ContributorId":"15275","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/23/1290506292406/Lisa-OCarroll-byline-004.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/lisaocarroll","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433219095","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396013484997/Charlie-Brooks-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Andrew Winning","altText":"Charlie Brooks","height":"54","credit":"Andrew Winning/Reuters","caption":"Charlie Brooks has told the phone-hacking jury that his laprops contained book drafts and ‘quite a lot of smut’.

relationships with undercover officers say police spies are still being given \"free rein\" to have sexual liaisons.</p><p>The eight have criticised the government for failing to ban undercover officers from striking up sexual relationships with the targets of their surveillance.</p><p>They say they have suffered enormous emotional trauma after discovering that men they had relationships with for years were undercover officers who had been sent to spy on political groups.</p><p>The women added that the failure \"to introduce measures to prevent further abuse amounts to institutional sexism\".</p><p>They made their criticisms as they responded to a Home Office consultation to draw up an updated code of conduct governing the deployments of undercover police officers.</p><p>Damian Green, the policing minister, said the control over undercover police deployments was being strengthened following a series of controversies.</p><p>This month the home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/06/stephen-lawrence-police-corruption-ellison-report\" title=\"\">Theresa May, ordered a public inquiry</a> into the undercover infiltration of political groups following revelations that a covert unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, had spied on the grieving family of Stephen Lawrence.</p><p>The women started their legal action after they discovered in recent years that they had had intimate relationships lasting up to six years with undercover officers who include Mark Kennedy, Bob Lambert, Mark Jenner and John Dines.</p><p>Lambert, who pretended to be an environmental and animal rights activist for five years, fathered a child with an activist before abandoning both of them when he ended his covert deployment.</p><p>Police chiefs have insisted that the undercover officers were not permitted \"under any circumstances\" to sleep with people they were spying on.</p><p>Over the past two years, police have hired lawyers to block the women's legal action in the courts.</p><p>In their response to the consultation, the women said: \"We note that despite the controversy over the issue of undercover relationships in the past couple of years, the codes of practice fail to make any mention of intimate and sexual relationships.</p><p>\"Having had our privacy intruded upon to a huge and damaging degree we feel that these guidelines fail to address the issues raised by our claims and fail to offer any increased protection to the public.\"</p><p>They added: \"The situation as it stands currently gives free rein to officers and their handlers.\"</p><p>Jenny Jones, the Green peer, backed the women's stance and called on the government to \"explicitly rule out undercover police from engaging in sexual relationships\" to \"prevent the police from making the mistakes of the past\".</p><p>Prosecutors are considering whether to charge three as-yet-unnamed police officers over sexual relationships they formed while undercover.</p>","headline":"Police spies still get free rein to have sexual liaisons, say women suing Met","trailText":"Group of eight women behind lawsuit criticise government for

was the week of the long-awaited and much-hyped Europe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/26/nigel-farage-vs-nick-clegg-the-debate-for-europe-live\">debate</a> between the Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, and the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage. Clegg, the surprise success of the 2010 party leaders debates, went into the LBC encounter hoping that gravitas and facts would see him through, but, although the Westminster punditocracy was inclined to declare him the winner, YouGov’s snap poll showed that 57% of viewers (based on a representative sample of 1,000) thought Farage did best. Given the innate Euroscepticism of the electorate, perhaps this shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Only 36% thought Clegg emerged on top. Still, 36% is higher than 9%, the Lib Dems’ poll rating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Debate polling\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/N1wfP/4/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>Debate polling graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>YouGov also found that although Farage’s sweaty and slightly shouty anti-establishmentism won him the debate, he failed to persuade viewers that Britain should leave the EU. At the end of the programme those in favour of staying in still outnumbered those in favour of leaving. Next week they go through it all again on the BBC. Farage will want to lighten up a bit (his fury was unappealing), and Clegg will want to cut some of the waffle and sharpen his lines of attack. <b>Andrew Sparrow</b></p><h2>Candy Crush has pricked the tech bubble</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c8bdfb9c-37bf-4c74-896c-9f486f0e4af5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396005009552/1b817ea8-e117-4d9d-8010-4d40c82b00fc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Candy Crush Saga\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A character from Candy Crush Saga on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

On Tuesday it was worth $7bn, the most valuable UK digital company ever. The company and its investors, directors and staff sold millions of shares to banks and their customers at $22.50 apiece. By Wednesday, when the shares started changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the game was over. Sensing a second technology bubble, traders wiped $1bn from King’s value and it made history again, as one of the worst ever US flotations. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Candy crush\">  <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/oqgtT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>Candy Crush share price graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>King was not alone in being dethroned: Twitter fell to its lowest price since December, and Facebook lost 7% after splurging $2bn on Oculus, which makes virtual reality goggles.

Amnesty said it was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/egypt-lawyers-boycott-mass-trial\">largest mass death sentence in modern memory</a>, and the UN said it contravened international law. The 529 were convicted of the murder of a single police officer after two court sessions that totalled less than an hour. At no point were lawyers allowed to defend their clients. <br></p><p>The whole exercise seemed to be aimed at intimidating the Muslim Brotherhood, the now-banned group that propelled the now-overthrown president Mohamed Morsi to power, and to whom the 529 were alleged – but not proven – to belong. More bad news could follow: a further 1,602 people will be tried en masse on similar charges by the same court within the next month. <b>Patrick Kingsley</b></p><h2>Police treat domestic violence as a second-class crime</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-daebe413-ce08-45c0-be09-f6374291cbee\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396010847315/343f9e2e-8169-4b63-bedf-b7d0cd84f70f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Police officer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The investigation found poor attitudes among frontline officers. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"http://www.hmic.gov.uk/publication/improving-the-police-response-to-domestic-abuse/\">report</a> from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary revealed what campaigners have been saying for some time: domestic abuse is the poor relation when it comes to crime-fighting. In a six-month study of all 43 police forces in England and Wales, the HMIC concluded that only eight forces dealt appropriately with domestic abuse, which accounts for 8% of all recorded crime and costs society an estimated £15.7bn a year. The report said domestic violence was a “priority on paper but not in practice” for most forces, and described “alarming and unacceptable” weaknesses in investigating, collecting evidence and bringing offenders to justice, poor management and supervision, and ineffective training. <br></p><p>The investigation also found poor attitudes among frontline officers, exposing a macho and sexist culture that persists within policing. Some victims told inspectors that officers sided with the male perpetrators when answering calls for help. As if to illustrate the point, this week a domestic violence victim <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/27/domestic-violence-victim-wins-damages-metropolitan-police\">won damages from the Metropolitan police</a> for gross abuse of power, after an officer on a 999 call plied her with drink and sexually exploited her. <b>Sandra Laville</b></p><h2>Ed Miliband is under pressure</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-78feb818-9e56-4010-9d9a-33dee5af9d7a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396005328845/4f7d22ca-bcff-41ba-b050-1a60bcf106aa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Miliband\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Ed Miliband in the House of Commons.

But boxing in the dark on budget day is tricky for every opposition leader, so most heads kept cool – until polls suggested <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/8686\">the party’s lead</a> was melting away. A letter signed by Labour factions of left and right who normally disagree urged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/23/labour-must-adopt-new-principles\">new principles</a> of “accountability”, “co-production” and “empowerment”, the sort of wonky words that Miliband sometimes gets teased for. Loftier commentators discerned an urge to transcend <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/labours-new-divide\">Fabian centralism</a>; harder-nosed hacks spotted a ragbag of malcontents united only in having a problem with Ed. The draft letter pre-dated the polling wobble, but that is why got it such attention. <br></p><p>As the week ended, the agenda turned to more comfortable Miliband terrain – energy bills – so he’ll hope to feel less heat next week. In the meantime, some commentators (HT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesTimes\">@SamCoatesTimes</a>) were quick to point out the number of his friends piling on the pressure, including <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/sound-labour-silence-miliband-can-t-rely-tories-keep-hurting-cameron-him\">Rafael Behr in the New Statesman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4045980.ece\">Jenni Russell in the Times</a>, <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2014/03/labour-needs-to-go-bigger-and-bolder-not-just-to-win-but-to-govern-too/\">Mark Ferguson on Labour List</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/pmqs-review-milibands-price-freeze-saves-him-he-needs-new-hit\">George Eaton in the New Statesmen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/24/labour-tories-populus-comres-polls-jon-cruddas\">John Cruddas in the Guardian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10722693/This-Labour-love-in-has-to-end-its-time-to-make-some-enemies.html\">Mary Riddell in the Telegraph</a>. <b>Tom Clark</b></p><h2>The Spanish don’t sleep</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2251c6d7-feca-4b90-bda5-6b3becd683b7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396010702942/b16df582-60c5-4e9c-bfd4-fa83b8426a6c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Voice Kids\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The finale of Spain's The Voice Kids finished at 1.25am.

We learned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/spain-working-hours-ending-siesta\">Spaniards sleep 53 minutes less than the European average</a>. One group says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/spanish-tv-airs-childrens-shows-past-bedtime-viewers-association\">prime-time TV is to blame</a>, pointing out that more than half of Spain’s top-rated television programmes finish later than midnight. Even the most popular children’s shows don’t start until late into the night, meaning that on any given weeknight nearly 600,000 Spanish children aged four to 12 are watching TV after 10pm. Last week when the finale of The Voice Kids finished at 1.25am, more than 130,000 Spanish children were still watching. <br></p><p>The Association of Communication Users is demanding that Spanish TV networks move children’s programming earlier. They’ve joined the many who are working to set Spaniards on a path towards better sleep habits, whether it be by rolling the clocks back an hour or introducing a standard 9-5 workday. As one campaigner explained: “We’re in a country beset by crisis, which requires everyone to put in a little extra effort to maintain high levels of commitment and work efficiency.” <b>Ashifa Kassam</b></p><h2>Heat is on for the big six <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-58d142a2-a555-446a-a701-06c7437c938a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396008801454/1eec11bb-ff48-472f-a803-4baed90392d0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gas rings\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Dual fuel prices are up 24% in four years.

Hall’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/25/bbc-arts-coverage-extra-3m\">bumper arts package</a> – lots more Shakespeare and a “front-row seat” at arts events up and down the country – was no surprise coming from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/22/bbc-tony-hall-appointed-new-director-general\">former chief executive of the Royal Opera House</a>. It was handily timed as the BBC gets down to the business of charter renewal and securing from the government – whoever is in power after next May’s general election – an increase in the licence fee.  Younger viewers could be forgiven for thinking their dedicated BBC3 TV channel (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/06/bbc3-closure-bbc1-drama\">going online-only next year</a>) has been sacrificed on the altar of high art.

The patch of the southern ocean that crews are scouring for any trace of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane covers almost 470,000 nautical square miles, making it roughly the size of Alaska, according to Associated Press.

They never feel that kind of joy again.” The Paltrow-Martin uncoupling has clearly had an effect, at least on Woodward Thomas’s book sales: her rank in paper copies has gone up from 9,381st to 7,962nd in the UK this week, and her Kindle ranking on Amazon from 42,761st to 17,943. Not earth-shattering, true, but, hey, she’s not bitter. <b>Claire Phipps</b></p>","headline":"Ten things we learned this week","trailText":"From Clegg v Farage to Paltrow minus Martin, via Egypt, Ed Miliband and the energy market – a roundup of the week's news<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396007651583/dcd7acdc-98af-446f-82da-975eb980fe63-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1918","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-31T13:30:40+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/28/ten-things-we-learned-this-week","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/28/ten-things-we-learned-this-week","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-video-433083928","relation":"body","type":"video","assets":[{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/mp4","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights-16x9.mp4","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","durationMinutes":"5","mediaId":"gu-video-433083928","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_8849928.jpg","durationSeconds":"15"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/3gpp:small","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_3gpSml16x9.3gp","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","durationMinutes":"5","mediaId":"gu-video-433083928","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_8849928.jpg","durationSeconds":"15"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/3gpp:large","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_3gpLg16x9.3gp","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","durationMinutes":"5","mediaId":"gu-video-433083928","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_8849928.jpg","durationSeconds":"15"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/m3u8","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights/140327lbcdebatehighlights.m3u8","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","durationMinutes":"5","mediaId":"gu-video-433083928","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_8849928.jpg","durationSeconds":"15"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/webm","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/26//140327lbcdebatehighlights.webm","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","durationMinutes":"5","mediaId":"gu-video-433083928","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2014/03/26/140327lbcdebatehighlights_8849928.jpg","durationSeconds":"15"}},{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/26/1395870708455/The-debate-for-Europe-Nic-001.jpg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/26/1395870708455/The-debate-for-Europe-Nic-001.jpg","source":"guardian.co.uk","photographer":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"The debate for Europe: Nick Clegg v Nigel Farage -

If there is something in the letters that suggests Prince Charles will be a poor monarch, then his future subjects have a right to know.</p><p>\"The head of state is a position of great influence and a clash between an opinionated head of state and a government could cause a constitutional crisis.\"</p><p>Over the past four years, the government has hired lawyers to contest a series of hearings into whether the letters – said by Grieve to contain the prince's \"most deeply held personal views and beliefs\" – should be released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>Two years ago, the independent freedom of information tribunal ruled against the government and ordered that the letters should be published as the public should know how the prince had sought to influence ministers in the last Labour government.</p><p>A month later, Grieve overruled the tribunal and vetoed the publication of the letters, which he said were \"particularly frank\".</p><p>Grieve justified his use of the veto by arguing that the public could read the letters and believe that the heir to the throne had been \"disagreeing with government policy\".</p><p>This perception, he added,  \"would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king\".</p><p>The veto was challenged by the Guardian in the courts. The government lost again this month when the master of the rolls, Lord Dyson, and two other judges decided that Grieve had acted unreasonably when he overrode the freedom of information tribunal. Dyson also ordered the attorney general to pay the Guardian's legal costs, totalling £96,000.</p><p>As the case stands, the government will have to publish the letters unless it can win an appeal at the supreme court.</p><p>Grieve said in the parliamentary answer: \"If we are successful in the next stage of legal proceedings, the government would seek to recover a substantial proportion of these costs from the Guardian.\"</p><p>The government is understood to have engaged new lawyers to fight its corner at the supreme court.</p><p>The prince has for years been sending letters – known as the \"black spider\" memos because of his handwriting – to politicians, outlining his views on public issues.</p><p>The Guardian has been seeking to see 27 pieces of correspondence between the prince and ministers in seven government departments between September 2004 and April 2005.</p><p>The letters were sent to ministers in the Cabinet Office and the departments responsible for business, health, schools, environment, culture and Northern Ireland.</p>","headline":"Ministers spend £1/4m on Prince Charles letters legal row","trailText":"Attorney general forced to reveal cost of preventing publication of prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396008702002/Prince-Charles-004.jpg","wordcount":"604","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-31T11:20:07Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/28/prince-charles-letters-quarter-of-a-million-pounds","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/28/prince-charles-letters-quarter-of-a-million-pounds","tags":[{"id":"uk/prince-charles","webTitle":"Prince Charles","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-charles","references":[]},{"id":"politics/freedomofinformation","webTitle":"Freedom of information","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/freedomofinformation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/freedomofinformation","references":[]},{"id":"uk/monarchy","webTitle":"Monarchy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"media/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/pressandpublishing","references":[]},{"id":"media/national-newspapers","webTitle":"National newspapers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/national-newspapers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/national-newspapers","references":[]},{"id":"media/newspapers","webTitle":"Newspapers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/newspapers","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robevans","webTitle":"Rob Evans","rcsId":"GNL147926","r2ContributorId":"16342","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/rob_evans_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rob Evans has won awards for his work both on corruption scandals and for promoting freedom of information.

It is possibly one of the most bananas policies we could humanly have,\"</p><p>\"All you need to do is to talk to business people or, indeed, students in any other country who want to come and spend money here … it is completely useless in terms of recruiting people,\" Micklethwait told the committee.</p><p>Quoting figures that almost £1 in every £6 spent in Britain by overseas residents came from those who required a visitor's visa, the 12-member committee said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/25/uk-visa-sell-off-defended-government-advisers\" title=\"\">government's rhetoric</a> was also potentially <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/25/coalition-row-adverts-illegal-immigrants\" title=\"\">putting people off</a> from arriving.</p><p></p><p>The coalition, they said, needed to \"present and communicate their visa and immigration policies with a level of balance and in a tone that do not discourage those who would add to the UK's prosperity from coming to the UK and supporting its businesses and trade.\"</p><p>\"We do not believe that this is always the case at present,\" the report added.</p><p></p><p>The newly established committee said the Home Office should remove students from its immigration cap, and that counting students as part of overall migration figures was both \"destructive\" and \"disingenuous\". The evidence given to them, they said, \"was emphatic\" that falls in student numbers were due to UK visa policies and visa administration.</p><p>Cardiff university's president and vice-chancellor, Professor Colin Riordan, told the committee the increased cost and complexity of visas had damaged the sector, and that instead of seeing projected growth of up to 15%, the numbers of students coming from abroad dipped by 0.4%.</p><p>\"Counting students as part of overall migration figures is not only destructive of the UK's attractiveness and international links, but is disingenuous,\" because many students did not go on to stay in the UK, the report says.</p><p>\"The government should remove students from net migration targets, and publish data on how previous progress on migration targets would have looked had the government not counted students in previous years,\" the committee recommended.</p><p>They also pointed out that the degree of consensus between six select parliamentary committees on this issue was \"unprecedented\".</p><p>However, a Home Office spokesperson said there would be no change to the way the target was made up. The spokesperson said: \"Students will remain in the net migration statistics because they are not all temporary visitors. They have an impact on communities, public services and infrastructure.</p><p>\"We are determined to prevent abuse of the student route and the changes we have made are having the right effect. The UK is open to the brightest and the best students and the latest figures show the number applying to come to our world-class universities is increasing.</p><p>\"We are building an immigration

Editor <b>Ian Wylie</b> explains more</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>It’s not quite the Higgs Boson or cosmological inflation, but I experience a daily phenomenon of close to cosmic deflation in the universe of local journalism. At precisely 6.30pm each day, the announcement of “news where you are” ignites a predictable chain reaction of drugs bust, factory closure, reporter-outside-crown-court and potholes before fizzling out with heart-warming liver transplant story.</p><p>I live and work in the north-east of England, but this phenomenon is also observable “where you are”. These small, seemingly unconnected stories are the atoms of local news – or at least, the scientific matter we’ve accepted as immutable - that comprise local TV, radio, newspapers or brochures that masquerade as magazines.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be that way: which is why I’m part of a team using <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ianwylie/northern-correspondent\">Kickstarter</a> to launch a magazine of longform, narrative journalism in the north east. A New Yorker in Newcastle … if you can imagine such a thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-82b6ad0a-566f-48da-8b5f-02a5bbb2d94e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395930257914/e61b8902-7e0a-4b12-ba3d-2c26f3161cd9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Northern Correspondent\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Northern Correspondent Photograph: /Northern Correspondent</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Longform. Local. Polar opposites, no? My corner of England is home to two and a half million people, two and a half million people with stories to tell. And within that two and a half million we’re betting there’s more than a few who crave reporting about their region that’s more substantial, stimulating and satisfying than what’s currently on offer.</p><p>It’s a region, like yours, that deserves and needs its stories to be told and heard in depth, but the opportunities to tell and hear these stories are fast diminishing. In the past decade, more than 20% of the UK’s local newspapers have closed. Cuts in the numbers of journalists and the production of local newspapers or regional programmes many miles from the communities they serve mean huge “news gaps” are opening up. </p><p>The job of “northern correspondent” is under threat as news organisations chase global rather local audiences. In 1976 the Guardian had 94 journalists based in Manchester. It now has only two staff reporters in England who are not based in London. “We are all competing in an increasingly noisy media world and it is only going to get louder and more crowded,” the Independent’s northern correspondent, Jonathan Brown, tells me. “You have to work harder to get your stories heard.”</p><p>I recall my excitement when, in 1994, I realised my new 14.4kb-a-second Motorola modem, Apple Powerbook and Netscape browser could connect me to anyone in the world. The internet, email and desktop publishing meant journalists like me didn’t need to be in London or New York to publish or be published. </p><p>Two decades later, our media industries remain stubbornly London-centric. Economic forces, interests and arguments of scale and consolidation have suppressed those opportunities and dreams. </p><p>This is not news. The career path for a journalist has traditionally been local to regional, then national and international. Only a fool like me swims the other way. I worked 16 years for the Guardian in the capital, commuting back and forth from Newcastle until a tiny voice in my head told me I was too old to be sleeping on my London friends’ sofas and airbeds.</p><p>And as consumers of news, the social media habits we’ve developed in recent years ensure we’re more likely to know what’s happening in New York or New Zealand than Newcastle.</p><p>And yet –in spite of, or maybe because of this globalisation – we’re increasingly keen to source other products and services locally, support our local butcher or greengrocer. There’s a greater desire, once we step away from our tablets and laptops, to step back into the real world of communities and neighbours. We know intuitively that this is “a good thing” to do. </p><p>At the same time, we’re observing a growing appetite for longer form, more narrative journalism that is willing and able to engage readers’ interests in important subjects and themes across three, four or five thousand words.</p><p>Northern Correspondent is a small group of journalists and story-tellers, writers, photographers, illustrators, film-makers and broadcasters who are passionate about telling stories of the people and places of the north east. We’re going to tell those stories in whichever medium is best for telling each story. Our journey is beginning with a printed magazine, because we love the written word, but we plan to make documentary films and radio programmes too. </p><p>A New Yorker for Newcastle - sounds like a joke. I think I just heard some of my London-based editors guffaw. But that’s OK. “Getting chippy about the north and the raw deal it gets doesn't appeal to readers elsewhere and isn't good for anyone's own soul either,” is the advice from Martin Wainwright, a former Guardian northern correspondent.</p><p>Maybe we’ll discover you cannot change the laws of journalism physics – that the gravitational pull of London makes it impossible to create and sustain a credible news ecosystem elsewhere.</p><p>But it’s worth a crack, isn’t it?</p>","headline":"Welcome the Northern Correspondent: a New Yorker for Newcastle?","trailText":"Fed up with their local news offering, a group of top flight journalists have decided to launch a new magazine of long-form narrative journalism in the north-east of England.

In an email on 17 November 2006 sent on to 11 police colleagues, a counter-terrorism officer, DS Jolly, wrote: \"In essence some of Stuart's [Dr Black's] work … has been proved to be unsound.\"</p><p>Kamlish told the court that the legal abuse in not disclosing the forensic expert's critical report and police emails was \"as bad as it gets\".</p><p>Two weeks after the 7/7 bombings, which killed 52 people, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/04/terrorism.world1\" title=\"\">four suspects were seen fleeing trains and buses</a> after rucksacks they were carrying began fizzing but seemingly failed to detonate. Asiedu dumped his device beforehand and later handed himself in to police.</p><p>In 2007 Asiedu pleaded guilty to conspiracy to causing explosions after jurors could not reach a verdict about his guilt in the trial of the 21/7 bombers. His lawyers argue he would not have pleaded had he known the doubts about Black's evidence.</p><p>The event caused widespread panic and led to a huge security operation in the capital and the killing of an innocent young Brazilian man, Jean Charles de Menezes, by armed police.</p><p>Counsel for the crown, Max Hill QC, dismissed allegations from Asiedu's lawyers that crucial documents had been &nbsp;deliberately concealed.</p><p>He said that at all stages of the original prosecution Black had made his reports available to the defendants' lawyers. He said expert evidence that had been used to convict the terrorists came from a number of witnesses and that no single expert formed the cornerstone of the prosecution.Addressing Asiedu's demand for more documents, Hill said prosecution lawyers had nothing to hide and had not taken \"a narrow approach\" to disclosing documents to Asiedu legal team. He added that the criticisms levelled against Black by Doyle and the other FEL scientists had been \"misinterpreted\" and reminded the court that Asiedu had pleaded guilty to his part in the bomb plot.</p><p>The three judges, Lord Justice Leveson, Mr Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Foskett, delayed giving a ruling on whether to allow Asiedu to launch his appeal. The delay came after prosecutors agreed to hand over more internal government documents to Asiedu's lawyers.Leveson told the hearing that it appeared to be &nbsp;\"very important case\" involving allegations of a conspiracy between police and a scientist or scientists to pervert the course of justice. He told the court : \"I am concerned to ensure that we deal with all the issues that can be legitimately raised\" adding that he was keen to ensure that the case did not drag on.</p><p>At the preliminary hearing at the court of appeal, Kamlish, for the applicant, told the court that Sean Doyle, a former chief government scientist at FEL turned whistleblower, had said in witness statements that he helped prepare the \"potential miscarriage\" report with two other FEL scientists before the start of the 2007 bombers' trial.

It said those issues were a matter for individual companies.</p><p></p><p>Pointing out that independence would present the industry with opportunities, on issuing government bonds and currency, and on legal services, it said the hypothetical long term benefits of a smaller, more dynamic economy and a more attractive tax system were hard to weigh up.</p><p></p><p>John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said other senior figures in Scottish finance, including former SFE executive director James Scott and Sir George Mathewson, former chairman of RBS, believed independence offered the industry \"significant opportunites.\"</p><p></p><p>He dismissed the SFE paper as a briefing note by SFE officials, not the industry's considered view. A steady rise in the yes vote in recent opinion polls also established that voters did not buy \"the bluff and bluster\" of those opposed to independence.</p><p></p><p>\"The reality is that Scotland is a wealthy country, with a successful financial services industry which is more than capable of thriving under any constitutional position,\" Swinney said.</p>","headline":"Scottish banks warned on independence","trailText":"A 'yes' vote for independence in Scotland would lead to financial services facing a long period of disruption, says a trade body","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395952925321/George-Osborne-regional-v-006.jpg","wordcount":"761","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T19:43:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/scottish-banks-warned-independence","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/scottish-banks-warned-independence","tags":[{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/banking","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/severincarrell","webTitle":"Severin Carrell","r2ContributorId":"19388","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/severin_carrell_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Severin Carrell is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scotland\">Scotland</a> correspondent for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\">Guardian</a>.

It was announced by Leicester University \"beyond reasonable doubt\", after a battery of tests on the bones they excavated in autumn 2012.</p><p>Martin Biddle, emeritus professor of medieval archaeology at Oxford, and Michael Hicks, head of history at Winchester University, claim that the DNA, radiocarbon dating and other tests, don't add up to any certainty that the bones are Richard's. The skeleton could be one of his many cousins through the 16 children borne by his grandmother Joan Beaufort, they suggest, or a contemporary who died of similar injuries.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=\"http://www.historyextra.com/news/was-skeleton-found-leicester-car-park-really-richard-iii\" title=\"\">BBC History Magazine</a>, Hicks said that \"lots of other people who suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the church were the bones were found\".</p><p>Biddle said that the bones had been damaged and disturbed during the excavation, and called for the field records of the excavation to be made available. He also called for \"something akin to a coroner's court\" to consider all the evidence.</p><p>\"How many burials were made there in the three centuries of the friary's existence and indeed after the battle of Bosworth? Without further excavation there is no way of knowing and hence no certainty about the burial that it has been claimed was that of Richard III.\"</p><p>Hicks said that radiocarbon, which dated the bones to the period of Richard's death, was an imprecise technique. \" It will give you an era but nothing more. In this case it covers a period of 80 years.\"</p><p>He also queried the use of mitochondrial DNA, passed through the female line, to trace a relationship between Richard to two living relatives, including the London based furniture maker Michael Ibsen.</p><p>\"Joan Beaufort had 16 children, which made her the ancestor of much of the nobility of the Wars of the Roses – quite a few of whom died violently in those conflicts. There is some scientific debate about the accuracy of matching mitochondrial DNA in this way, but even if it is precise in this case, I'd argue that it does not pinpoint these bones as Richard's.\"</p><p>Leicester University though, is standing by its man. Professor Lin Foxhall, head of the archaeology and ancient history department, and the historian on the Richard III team, said: \"The identification of Richard III is not based solely on the DNA, radiocarbon and scoliosis evidence, but on a combination of many different lines of evidence, which analysed and evaluated together, all point in the same direction. Most of the possibilities raised by Professor Hicks have been considered and eliminated, and the radiocarbon dating is sufficiently precise to ascertain that the burial is not one belonging to a much earlier period in the life of the friary.\" She added that although much of the evidence is <a href=\"http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/\" title=\"\">already on the university website</a> more was still being published in peer-reviewed journals.</p><p>\"We anticipate that these will address the issues raised by Professor Hicks and Professor Biddle, and if not they are, of course, at liberty to write academic papers presenting the evidence to support their views – that, after all  is the purpose of academic debate, and how knowledge moves forward! We will make as much of the data as possible openly available in due course, but, as is normal academic practice, not until our research is fully published.\"</p>","headline":"'Richard III remains' found in Leicester car park have doubt cast upon them","trailText":"<p>Leading academics claim there is no proof Leicester body with twisted spine belonged to the last Plantagenet, Richard III</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395946783398/Richard-III-archaeologica-006.jpg","wordcount":"608","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T18:54:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/richard-iii-remains-leicester-doubt-car-park-academics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/richard-iii-remains-leicester-doubt-car-park-academics","tags":[{"id":"uk/richard-iii","webTitle":"Richard III","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/richard-iii","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/richard-iii","references":[]},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"uk/leicester","webTitle":"Leicester","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/leicester","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/leicester","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"science/archaeology","webTitle":"Archaeology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/archaeology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","rcsId":"GNL004696","r2ContributorId":"16031","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/maev_kennedy_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433189736","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395946774228/Richard-III-archaeologica-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"REUTERS","photographer":"Darren Staples","altText":"Richard III archaeological dig","height":"54","credit":"Darren Staples/REUTERS","caption":"The trench where skeleton remains were found during an archaeological dig.

Mr Justice King said on Thursday that the prosecution evidence relating to an incident in which the MP, 56, is alleged to have tried to kiss a 27-year-old parliamentary worker in 2009-10 did not amount to sexual assault.</p><p>He amended the charge to attempted sexual assault after the complainant conceded under oath that Evans, allegedly drunk after spending time in the Strangers' Bar, had tried to kiss him but stopped when he said \"no\".</p><p>Evans denied all of the charges against him as he gave evidence for the first time on Thursday, calling one of the sexual assault allegations absurd.</p><p>He was asked by his barrister, Peter Wright QC, whether he had \"ever taken a man by the genitals in the Strangers' Bar as a form of introduction, one to the other?\" as one of the seven complainants had earlier told the court. Evans replied: \"No. It's as absurd as it sounds.\"</p><p>He also denied forcing himself on a man after tricking him into a kitchenette at his quarters in the houses of parliament after becoming deputy Speaker in 2010. His kitchen \"would not be high on my tour of the palace of Westminster\", he said.</p><p>He admitted having sex with a young man who accused him of raping him at his constituency home last year but insisted the sex was \"absolutely with consent\".</p><p>Asked by Wright about his family background, Evans said he was born in Swansea and educated at local schools. As soon as his head could be seen above the counter, he was involved in helping to run the family grocery shop, started by his grandfather in the 1930s, which he described as something like the store in TV sitcom Open All Hours.</p><p>He said he thought having all the newspapers in the shop sparked his interest in current affairs and politics, and he joined the Young Conservatives at the age of 17.</p><p>\"I always thought it was God's little joke – he made me born in Swansea and born a Tory. There's not many Tories in Swansea.\"</p><p>He told the court he was unsuccessful several times in running for office as both a councillor and an MP until he was finally elected as MP for Ribble Valley in 1992.</p><p>Asked why he did not go public about his sexuality until December 2010, in an article in the Mail on Sunday, Evans said he didn't want to upset his mother, who died in 2009.</p><p>\"My mother was in her 80s and there was no right time and I just didn't want to upset her. I didn't know how she would take it,\" said Evans, adding that in hindsight he wished he had told her. \"On reflection I think she would have taken it rather well. I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier.\"</p><p>The prosecution have claimed that Evans only went public about being gay after one of the alleged victims, a politics student, made a complaint to the higher echelons of the party in 2009. Patrick McLoughlin, then the opposition chief whip and now the transport secretary, told the court he advised Evans to go public about his sexuality after hearing of the student's allegations.</p><p>The case continues.</p>","headline":"Nigel Evans found not guilty on one sexual assault charge","trailText":"Judge instructs jury on verdict after saying evidence over MP's alleged kiss only amounts to attempted sexual assault","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395945207923/Nigel-Evans-arrives-at-Pr-004.jpg","wordcount":"586","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T17:36:08Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/nigel-evans-not-guilty-one-sexual-assault-charge-mp","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/nigel-evans-not-guilty-one-sexual-assault-charge-mp","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/6/22/1277217764498/Helen-Pidd-byline.-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

Female personnel made a disproportionate number of complaints about harassment and discrimination, but the army did not specify their nature, Atkins said.</p><p>\"This significantly undermines their ability to explore if there are particular problems experienced by minority groups [in the army] and must be addressed\", she said.</p><p>\"It remains a source of much regret to me that I have not been able, within the powers I have been given, to ensure that service personnel are treated fairly throughout their service careers, including when they make a complaint.\"</p><p>The service complaints system was not working efficiently, effectively or fairly and was not sustainable, Atkins told the defence secretary, Philip Hammond.</p><p>She said the principle reason for unfairness in the system lay in the delay in pursuing complaints, particularly in the army and RAF. Her report includes case studies which, she said, showed how a \"slow, ineffective and unfair system can exacerbate the wrong complained about, including damage to mental health\".</p><p>Atkins' report came just two weeks after Hammond announced plans to give her new powers. Her post will be transformed into that of an independent service complaints ombudsman.</p><p>None of the goals she had set for the armed forces to achieve by the end of 2013 were met, Atkins said.</p><p>Her report found that of the army's 12% increase in complaints last year, only 25% were resolved within the 24-week target and that only 26% of complaints made in 2013 were closed during the year.</p><p>In the RAF, there were 35% fewer new complaints, but only 29% of those made were resolved during the year and only 23% within the 24-week deadline.</p><p>By comparison, although complaints made in 2013 in the Royal Navy almost doubled, 78% were resolved within 24 weeks, giving them the best performance of the three services.</p><p>Atkins said: \"Although the working of the service complaints system is much improved since 2008, for the sixth year running I have been unable to give ministers and parliament an assurance that the system is yet working efficiently, effectively or fairly.\"</p><p>Defence minister Anna Soubry said: \"The progress made is recognised in her report, and I am pleased to see that the navy in particular is resolving complaints more quickly. I do of course realise that despite such improvements, there is still a long way to go before we have a system that is fully fair, effective and efficient.\"</p>","headline":"Army bullying, harassment and discrimination complaints rise sharply","trailText":"Number of complaints made rose by 12% in 2013, as watchdog says system for dealing with them is neither efficient nor fair","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2011/5/27/1306513881603/British-armed-forces-003.jpg","wordcount":"437","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T15:52:31Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/army-bullying-harassment-discrimination-complaints-rise","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/army-bullying-harassment-discrimination-complaints-rise","tags":[{"id":"uk/british-army","webTitle":"British Army","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/british-army","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/british-army","references":[]},{"id":"uk/military","webTitle":"Military","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/military","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/military","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"society/bullying","webTitle":"Bullying","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/bullying","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/bullying","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"money/discrimination-at-work","webTitle":"Discrimination at work","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/discrimination-at-work","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/discrimination-at-work","references":[]},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/richardnortontaylor","webTitle":"Richard Norton-Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004743","r2ContributorId":"16331","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/richard_norton-taylor_140x1.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Richard Norton-Taylor regularly contributes to BBC news and current affairs programmes.

They will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote to expose party lines on the issue.</p><p>Ofgem's decision to launch the deepest ever investigation into the big six power suppliers by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) followed pressure from the energy secretary, Ed Davey, and the government's inability to defuse the politics of the energy prices issue.</p><p>Ofgem, which has been under fire for failing to monitor the energy sector properly, said it felt compelled to act after its own review alongside the Office of Fair Trading and the CMA confirmed soaring corporate profits and plunging public confidence. It also reflects a change of the top team at Ofgem.</p><p>The latest Ofgem review had found only 43% of customers trusted the large energy companies to be open and transparent while their retail earnings had rocketed from £233m in 2009 to £1.1bn by 2012.</p><p>The new investigation could lead to recommendations for the big six such as British Gas and SSE to be broken up in an attempt to make inroads on their 95% market share.</p><p>\"Ofgem believes a referral [to the CMA] offers the opportunity to once and for all clear the air and decide if there are further barriers which are preventing competition from bearing down as hard as possible on prices,\" said Dermot Nolan, the new chief executive of Ofgem.</p><p>The regulators insist that they acted alone and not as a result of political pressure, but Davey recently sent a letter to them urging a deeper inquiry, particularly into the gas sector.&nbsp;</p><p>The watchdog admitted the review might take two years but promised in the meantime to increase penalties to \"tens of millions of pounds\" on any firms found guilty of breaking their licence conditions.</p><p>Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of British Gas parent group Centrica, immediately claimed that the inquiry would increase uncertainty and damage investment \"at a time when Britain's energy security is being seriously challenged\".</p><p>The former Lib Dem energy secretary Chris Huhne predicted a nailbiting time ahead as capacity margins are cut. He predicted that electricity rationing in the winter of 2015 was possible.</p><p>Huhne said that when in office he had rejected a competition inquiry because the semi-judicial process would create uncertainty. He added: \"That is the big downside here – that there is a greater risk of the lights going out precisely because inevitably the shareholders, the directors and the managers of the big six are bound to invest less than they would have otherwise done.\"</p><p>Consumer bodies gave a sceptical response to the parcel-passing by the regulators, especially since they will not report until 2016, with any reforms expected the following year.</p><p>Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: \"What is clear is that there is no cavalry coming to the rescue any time soon.\"</p><p>Henry de Zoete, co-founder of ThisIsTheBigDeal.com and a former aide to the education secretary, Michael Gove, said: \"All this decision does is push the issue further down the road. It will take years to report, and even longer to implement. Meanwhile, the energy companies will be delighted to continue business as usual.\"</p><p>The Tory energy select committee chairman, Tim Yeo, said there was a case  for just directly breaking up the big six, saying that Ofgem had been sitting on its hands for six months.</p><p>The claims were dismissed by Davey as \"absolutely, totally wrong\". There were 14 power projects in the pipeline covering the next 15 years, he said. Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said: \"It's important this is taken out of politics, actually. People make claims, and Labour have been all over the place on whether it's right to have vertical integration or whether the profits are too large. Let's have it properly investigated out of party politics and we'll get the answers we need.\"</p>","headline":"Ed Miliband to propose fresh energy price controls as he targets 'big six'","trailText":"The Labour leader will brush aside criticism by power providers and seek a Commons vote next week on immediate price freeze","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395956381770/Ed-zeMiliband--006.jpg","wordcount":"962","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T21:01:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/27/ed-miliband-energy-price-controls-freeze-big-six","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/mar/27/ed-miliband-energy-price-controls-freeze-big-six","tags":[{"id":"politics/edmiliband","webTitle":"Ed Miliband","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/edmiliband","references":[]},{"id":"environment/energy","webTitle":"Energy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/energy","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"money/energy","webTitle":"Energy bills","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/energy","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrickwintour","webTitle":"Patrick Wintour","rcsId":"GNL004731","r2ContributorId":"16227","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/02/10/PatrickWintour140x140.gif","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Wintour is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics\">political</a> editor for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/patrickwintour","references":[]},{"id":"profile/terrymacalister","webTitle":"Terry Macalister","rcsId":"GNL030712","r2ContributorId":"16511","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/terry_macallister_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Terry Macalister is energy editor of the Guardian.

If scaled up nationally, the research suggests that 44,000 primary school children had accessed pornographic material – and 200,000 under-16s. One site, Pornhub, was visited by 112,000 boys in the UK aged between 12 and 17.</p><p>Atvod said laws should be changed to protect children from seeing adult material on the internet.</p><p></p><p>The statistics were uncovered after the online habits of 45,000 desktop and laptop computer users were monitored for a month, with volunteers reflecting a cross-section of the population. It did not look at tablet or mobile use so may be an underestimate of porn viewing habits.</p><p>Atvod said the issue of children accessing online pornography was so urgent that it was \"critical the legislation is enacted during this parliament\".</p><p>It said sites that did not comply with legislation by carrying out age checks should be forbidden from processing payments from British customers.</p><p>Atvod already forces pornographic websites based in the UK to carry out age verification checks before customers can view explicit photographs or video, the BBC said, by requiring valid credit card details or personal information that can be checked.</p><p>But it said the vast majority of online pornography was downloaded from overseas businesses, over which it has no control.</p><p>Atvod wants all adult sites to request a licence that would only be granted if age checks were in place, with payment processors not allowed to handle fees for services from UK citizens to unregistered sites.</p><p></p><p>An Atvod spokesman said: \"The material that appears on the free services is placed there by the paid services to attract customers to sign up to subscriptions.</p><p>\"As long as the paid service placed content on a free service without age verification it would be in breach of its licensing conditions and so would not be able to access funds from the UK.</p><p>\"We're not saying this will stop all children seeing all pornography online.
