I now call on the leader of the Alliance party, David Ford, to clarify the party's position on whether or not support for a united Ireland is now official.\"</p><p></p><p>Alliance has already been under political and physical pressure from extreme loyalists over the party's decision to back a move to restrict the flying of the union flag last year at Belfast. The council voted to change the policy of flying the union flag atop Belfast City Hall to 18 designated days to mark events such as the Queen's two birthdays.</p><p></p><p>The party defended move amid protests and petrol bomb attacks on its offices and councillors' homes in 2013. They said the policy of 18 designated days is no different from most other councils in the rest of the UK. Alliance also point out that they blocked a move by Sinn Féin and Social Democratic and Labour party councillors at Belfast City Hall to remove the union flag altogether from the council headquarters.</p><p></p><p>However, Lo's latest comments will cause deep unease within the Alliance party, which holds its annual conference in east Belfast at the weekend and in the face not only of European but also local government elections. So far the party has not commented on whether it endorses or rejects her comments on a united Ireland.</p>","headline":"Cross-community Alliance candidate: United Ireland is viable option","trailText":"Anna Lo creates political furore by saying unity would help Ireland economically, socially and politically","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395324616255/Naomi-Long-006.jpg","wordcount":"481","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-23T14:48:48Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/20/united-ireland-better-placed-ulster-politician","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/20/united-ireland-better-placed-ulster-politician","tags":[{"id":"uk/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Ireland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/northernireland","references":[]},{"id":"politics/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Irish politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/northernireland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/northernireland","references":[]},{"id":"uk/republicanism","webTitle":"Republicanism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/republicanism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/republicanism","references":[]},{"id":"politics/european-elections","webTitle":"European elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/european-elections","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"uk/belfast","webTitle":"Belfast","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/belfast","references":[]},{"id":"politics/sinn-fein","webTitle":"Sinn Féin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/sinn-fein","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/henrymcdonald","webTitle":"Henry McDonald","rcsId":"GNL004658","r2ContributorId":"15264","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/23/1316792668937/henry-mcdonald.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Henry McDonald is the Observer's Belfast correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/henrymcdonald","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/henrymcdonald","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432577059","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395324607667/Naomi-Long-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Peter Morrison","altText":"Naomi Long","height":"54","credit":"Peter Morrison/AP","caption":"Naomi Long, Alliance’s only MP, may find her prospects are damaged by Anna Lo's remarks.

There's no single way to say anything without it being awkward. I was thinking I wish I could [but] I didn't feel able to.\"</p><p>Under questioning from Evans's barrister, Peter Wright QC, the complainant denied that he consented to sex with the 56-year-old MP following a night of drinking at his constituency home in Pendleton, Lancashire, last March.</p><p>\"Like most people I've woke up in the morning and thought I wish I hadn't done that but I've never been in a situation where I've consented to something sexual then the next day gone oh no, if I was drunk I wouldn't have consented,\" he told jurors.</p><p>On Wednesday the alleged victim told jurors that he froze in shock and felt \"disattached from my body\" when he awoke to find the ex-MP having sex with him last March.</p><p>He said he awoke face down on the bed, with his boxer shorts down by his thighs and the MP astride him. \"I just froze, silent. I was still, didn't move at all – couldn't move. I felt almost disattached from my body. I felt in shock, even though what had been going on back and forth all night, this was a rapid escalation and I wasn't prepared for it.\"</p><p>Giving evidence for a second day, the student, who is gay, dismissed as \"pure fiction\" a claim that he kissed Evans before they went to the MP's bedroom to have sex.</p><p>He denied that he asked Evans whether he should follow him into his bedroom, telling jurors that the MP \"escorted\" him into the room using his arm. Asked by Wright why he did not refuse to enter the MP's bedroom, the student said: \"That was my missed opportunity. That was fairly critical\".</p><p>When they were in bed the student tried to fend off Evans by saying he was tired and rolling over as the MP tried to grope and kiss him, the court heard.</p><p>Wright, for Evans, questioned why the younger man returned to the bed three times if he did not consent to the sexual touching. \"You haven't said no. You haven't said leave me alone. You haven't said I don't want to do this,\" said Wright.</p><p>\"I didn't do anything flirtatious at all,\" the complainant replied.</p><p>\"Having got into bed it became clear to you within a very short space of time that there were sexual overtures being made towards you and you didn't say stop it. You didn't then say no. You didn't physically push him away. And thereafter on three occasions you leave the bed and go to the bathroom and on all occasions you return to the same bedroom and get back into bed with the man?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" the alleged victim replied.</p><p>Asked whether he did anything more than tell the MP he was tired during this episode, he said: \"Roll over a bit more, try brush it off.\"</p><p>The student also denied being openly flirtatious with Evans at a Christmas party at the RAC club in London six months before the alleged rape.</p><p>Wright suggested the young man had his hands on the MP's chest and thighs and was looking longingly into his eyes when the pair chatted at the party. \"That's just ridiculous,\" the complainant said. \"I've never been like that towards Nigel, ever.\"</p><p>The student said he assumed it would just be himself and Evans at the dinner party, until the MP told him others would be there.</p><p>The court was shown a series of text messages between the complainant and a friend before the party. In one, the friend asked: \"I hope not just the two of you [at the dinner party]?\"</p><p>He replied: \"I think it is.\"</p><p>The friend responded: \"Wow, that will be spesh.\"</p><p>The man replied: \"I'm sure it will.\"</p><p>Unlike the previous six accusers, the alleged rape victim gave evidence from behind a screen in the witness box. He was shielded from the view of Evans who sat making notes in the glass-enclosed court dock.</p><p>The student is one of seven men who allege that Evans assaulted them between 2002 and 2013. Evans denies one rape, two indecent assaults and six sexual assaults.</p><p>The trial was adjourned until Friday.</p>","headline":"Student 'did not feel able' to turn down Nigel Evans' advances, court hears","trailText":"Alleged rape victim denies suggestion he kissed Evans before they went to the MP's bedroom to have sex","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395323262457/Nigel-Evans-006.jpg","wordcount":"767","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-23T13:54:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/20/student-nigel-evans-court","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/20/student-nigel-evans-court","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/josh-halliday","webTitle":"Josh Halliday","r2ContributorId":"38624","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/7/14/1279118930047/Josh-Halliday.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/JoshHalliday\">Josh Halliday</a> is a media and technology reporter.

The following year his girlfriend, now his wife, became pregnant and he stopped using cash machines.</p><p></p><p>\"My lifestyle changed. I stopped spending money. I started to get cash back in the supermarket and garages. I lived on expenses from the cashier's office. I lived a much more quiet lifestyle,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Langdale asked: \"So it wasn't a result of having any extra source of money?\"</p><p></p><p>Goodman said that in 2004 he had received \"a legacy of £140,000 from the death of my mother\" and that he had other bank accounts that were not accounted for in the police documents he was being cross examined on.</p><p></p><p>\"What we have here is an incomplete record of my financial history,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Asked \"what was it the police missed in terms of cash withdrawal?\", Goodman replied: \"I'm sorry, I think you are going to have to ask them.\"</p><p></p><p>Earlier Langdale put it to Goodman that he was prone to exaggeration and had \"hammed up\" a claim for £500 a week to pay a source, who the jury have been told was private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.</p><p></p><p>Langdale suggested to Goodman that an email imploring Coulson to maintain a £500-a-week contract with \"Alexander\", an alias he had created for Mulcaire, \"indicated quite clearly that Mr Coulson did not know that Alexander was Mr Mulcaire\".</p><p></p><p>He said it was a \"further example of hamming it up, flannelling, trying to persuade someone to do something\".</p><p></p><p>Goodman denied he had become \"work shy\" or \"reluctant to go out of the office\" to get stories in 2003. He said the atmosphere had become \"very strange\" when Coulson was promoted to editor that year and appointed Neil Wallis as his deputy.</p><p></p><p>Langdale put it to him that he was known as \"the eternal flame\" because \"you never went out\" of the office. Goodman said the phrase was coined by the paper's former news editor Ian Edmondson and that \"no, it wasn't accurate\".</p><p></p><p>Goodman was challenged about a series of payments for stories, which Langdale suggested were bogus.</p><p></p><p>The jury heard that one of Goodman's regular sources \"Anderson\", a fake ID for a journalist to whom he made cash payments, was paid £300 for a spotting an item about Sarah Ferguson in the Observer.</p><p></p><p>Goodman told jurors it was \"absolutely commonplace\" to pay other journalists who \"spotted\" stories they had missed. \"The skill is identifying the story and passing it on, not writing it,\" said Goodman. \"The Observer is not a paper I normally take.\"</p><p></p><p>Another item raised by Langdale was an article about Prince Charles wanting to return to a traditional English curriculum, which he said was a \"straight lift\" from the Guardian. Langdale said the story had also appeared days earlier in other papers including the Western Mail and the Birmingham Post.</p><p></p><p>Goodman said he would have not have been expected to read the regional papers and might have missed the Guardian story.</p><p></p><p>Langdale asked him what justified a payment of £650 to \"a Mr Hall\" for an item he wrote about Madonna, which bore a resemblance to a piece in fashion magazine W.</p><p></p><p>\"Spotting a story, identifying it, packaging it up and selling it on was what was worth £650,\" said Goodman, who added it appeared as the top story in his Carvery column and would have been worth less if it had appeared further down.</p><p></p><p>\"Mr Hall\" was also paid £250 for an item on Uma Thurman that appeared in the Daily Mirror and the Sun the day before.</p><p></p><p>Langdale put it to Goodman: \"Is it a case of you simply lifting and putting in a cash claim for a source that hadn't given you the information?\" he replied: \"No completely untrue.\"</p><p></p><p>He said he could \"only assume\" that he had missed the Sun and Mirror items because if he had read them the story would not have made the News of the World because the readership was too much of \"a match\".</p><p></p><p>There was laughter in court as Goodman mistook footballer Titus Bramble for a royal protection officer.</p><p></p><p>Asked about a Mulcaire note featuring the name \"Titus Bramble\", he said he thought he was \"formerly the Duchess of Cornwall's personal protection officer\". Mr Justice Saunders intervened to say he believed he was a footballer who previously played for Ipswich.</p><p></p><p>Goodman was then directed not to try and guess who people were if he could not remember precisely.</p><p></p><p>The former royal editor denied that he would talk \"nonsense around the office\" and used \"florid\" and \"over dramatic\" language in emails to superiors. \"I would use language to have emphasis, to make a point\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Langdale put it to Goodman that \"it would not be a surprise to you\" that \"any editor\" would sometimes take what he said \"with a large degree of salt\".

death of a man as he was being deported from the UK.</p><p></p><p>Jimmy Mubenga, 46, died after being restrained by the three on board a plane at Heathrow airport in October 2010.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday the Crown Prosecution Service said the guards, Stuart Tribelnig, 38, Terry Hughes, 53, and Colin Kaler, 51, would be charged with manslaughter.</p><p></p><p>Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of CPS special crime, said: \"There is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig.\"</p><p></p><p>Mubenga's wife, Adrienne Makenda Kambana, said: \"\"My children and I have waited a long time for this decision. We hope the CPS will now move this case forward quickly. We feel like we are another step closer to getting justice for Jimmy.\"</p><p></p><p>The three guards were arrested following Mubenga's death but in 2012 the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring any charges against them.</p><p></p><p>That decision was reviewed following an inquest into Mubenga's death last year in which a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing following an eight-week hearing.</p><p></p><p>McHaffie said: \"We have completed a fresh review of all of the evidence relating to the death of Jimmy Mubenga, including the new evidence arising from the inquest, and decided that three men should be prosecuted for manslaughter.\"</p><p></p><p>The CPS said it had decided not to prosecute G4S for corporate manslaughter.</p><p></p><p>\"We have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute G4S for either offence and, due to the fact that related proceedings are now active, it would be inappropriate to comment further,\" it said in a statement.</p><p></p><p>Mubenga and his wife came to the UK in 1994. His family says that as a student leader in Angola he had fallen foul of the regime and was forced to flee. After a protracted legal battle he was granted exceptional leave to remain and he and Kambana moved to Ilford in Essex, where they set up home with their five children.</p><p></p><p>In 2006 Mubenga was convicted of actual bodily harm and sentenced to two years in prison following a brawl in a nightclub.</p><p></p><p>After serving his sentence he was transferred to an immigration detention centre and the process to deport him began.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday the family's solicitor, Mark Scott, welcomed the CPS's decision to prosecute the guards, adding: \"It has been a three-and-a-half year struggle for the family to get to this point and they hope to get on with their lives once this final challenge is met.\"</p><p></p><p>The three guards are due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 7 April.</p><p></p><p>Solicitors for the three said they would be vigorously denying the charges. A statement on behalf of Hughes, Kaler and Tribelnig said: \"My clients are very disappointed with the CPS's decision, having previously been told after a very lengthy police investigation that no charges would be brought against them. They will be vigorously denying these charges in court.\"</p><p></p><p>Deborah Coles, co-director of the Inquest campaign group, which has supported Mubenga's family, said the CPS's decision \"reiterates the importance of legal aid for families to be represented at inquests\".</p><p></p><p>\"It is legal aid that ensured a robust examination of all the evidence, which has ultimately resulted in today's welcome decision. The cuts to legal aid mean that cases like this in the future may well not receive this kind of scrutiny.\"</p>","headline":"Jimmy Mubenga: three G4s guards to be charged with

He argued the previous introduction of the new single-tier pension had made the budget reforms possible by guaranteeing people a level of income that he described as \"a generous basic state pension\".</p><p>He said the requirements that people had to take out annuities were old fashioned and put in place many decades ago. \"They may be right for many people, but they are also not right for many others. Returns from annuities have been much lower over the past 15 years or so and in the end people who have saved through their lives and earned that money should be trusted with good advice about what they do with that money.\"</p><p>He added \"it is their money\", saying the government was committed to providing \"a right to impartial face-to-face advice so they can make informed choices. It is pretty likely they are going to want to provide for their future when they retire.\"</p><p>\"What I would say is that people who saved their whole lives, saved for a pension, these are responsible people,\" he said in a round of broadcast interviews.</p><p>He said the shake-up, which will allow people on low incomes to draw down their funds without paying punitive tax rates, had been welcomed by a wide range of consumer groups. However, the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds have been critical of the potential impact on those that may misuse their pension pots.</p><p>The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has also said questions need answering on the quality of the advice to be given and whether tax advantages would be given to those who transferred their pot into property.</p><p>Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"George Osborne is such a tactical politician that everything has got to be a trap and he announces for six months that he is setting a trap and then he gets a bit frustrated that we don't walk into it.\"</p><p>Balls said \"more flexibility and choice\" in pensions was to be welcomed but that it was \"important that we look hard to see what it's actually going to mean.</p><p>\"Will there proper protections and proper financial education so people don't make the wrong choices and end up running out of their pension pot well before their retirement ends?\" he asked.</p><p>\"And will it become a way in which people can save substantial amounts of money tax advantaged, take it out at retirement and then use the money essentially to avoid tax?\"</p><p>Balls said there was little for him to disagree with in the budget because \"it was such an underwhelming budget\" that had a \"huge hole in the middle\".  \"Where was the action to help families who can't afford to save at the moment?\" he said.</p><p>\"Where was the action to tackle youth unemployment? Where was the freeze in energy prices?\"</p><p>Osborne acknowledged the Office for Budget Responsibility had projected a fall in savings, saying he was not a miracle worker. He said the reforms would not change matters overnight, but would help take the country towards a new culture.</p><p>But he added: \"For the whole country it has been a difficult period. That is what happens when you mess up your country.\"</p><p>He said: \"We can make these decisions sensibly. We have got a long-term economic plan that is working, that is pulling out of this resilient economy.\"</p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Osborne dismissed suggestions that he was hitting teachers, nurses and train drivers by reducing the threshold for 40p income tax in real terms.</p><p>He said such people were all \"part of a hard-working nation\", and insisted those on middle incomes were still benefiting from the rise in the personal allowance.</p>","headline":"Budget 2014: George Osborne defends pensions overhaul","trailText":"Chancellor insists pensioners should be trusted with

Ignoring warnings from the former chancellor Lord Lawson that too many people will end up paying the higher rate, Osborne raised the 40% threshold from £41,450 to £41,865.</p><p>But from April 2015, Osborne said the point at which workers would be taxed would rise to £10,500, a long cherished Lib Dem policy. He confirmed that the higher rate threshold would be increased by another below-inflation rise of 1% to £42,285 in April 2015.</p><p>From this April, workers will see a small increase in their take home pay as a result of changes to personal allowances, although it will be unlikely to be enough to make up for the increases in household bills.</p><p>A couple earning £20,000 and £18,000 respectively will see their joint tax and National Insurance bills fall by around £270 a year as a result of the tax changes that come into force next month. A single pensioner with a £10,000 a year private pension will be £123 a year better off after April, once pension and tax changes are taken into account.</p><p>The biggest impact will be felt by those earning £42,000, who from next month will find themselves higher rate tax payers, and will be required to declare any extra income such as interest on savings, overtime, or share dividends – and pay 40% income tax on those earnings.</p><p>Since the coalition took office four years ago, \"fiscal drag\" means the higher-rate threshold has dropped by £4,910 in real terms, putting an extra 1.4 million people into the 40% bracket.</p><p>Alison Hill, tax director at PwC, warned of April's tax cut at the bottom:</p><p>\"The full benefit of the 2013-14 personal allowance increase is not being passed on to those on the cusp of the higher-rate tax threshold. The personal allowance will increase by £560 on 6 April this year, however the higher rate tax threshold has only been increased by £415. There is still an actual reduction in the basic rate tax band of £145.\"</p><p>Greg Limb, tax partner at KPMG, said:  \"After several years of seeing any gain through the personal tax allowance rising being cancelled out by a drop in the amount at which the 40% rate kicks in, now at last most higher rate tax payers will see a reduction in their income tax liability, of around £180. While a relatively modest amount in the scheme of things, I am sure it is something that individuals will welcome.\"</p><p>Child benefit, which has been frozen for the last three years and in effect removed from any household in which one earner takes home £60,000 or more, rises 1% from April. It means mothers will get £20.50 per week for their first child, and £13.55 for any siblings. Households in which one earner takes home between £50,000 and £60,000 now have a proportion of the child benefit clawed back through the self-assessment process.</p><p>In a separate move, the chancellor confirmed that from April 2015, married couples and civil partners will be able to transfer £1,050 of their income tax personal allowance to their spouse or civil partner. Couples where neither partner is a higher or additional rate tax payer will be eligible to transfer. The transferable amount will be set at 10% of the personal allowance in each tax year.</p><p>For those who can pay tax, but repeatedly fail to do so, the chancellor is to give new powers to HM Revenue and Customs to raid their accounts.</p>","headline":"Personal allowance: Osborne's budget has been far from generous","trailText":"<p><strong>Miles Brignall: </strong>The small increase in personal allowances probably won't make up for the rise in household bills</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395087036703/Chancellor-of-the-Exchequ-006.jpg","wordcount":"626","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-22T22:06:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/mar/19/budget-personal-allowance-not-generous","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2014/mar/19/budget-personal-allowance-not-generous","tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2014","webTitle":"Budget 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/budget-2014","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/budget-2014","references":[]},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/budget","references":[]},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/georgeosborne","references":[]},{"id":"profile/milesbrignall","webTitle":"Miles Brignall","rcsId":"GNL342816","r2ContributorId":"16152","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/miles_brignall_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Miles Brignall covers consumer issues for the Guardian in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\">money</a> section, published each Saturday.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/milesbrignall","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/milesbrignall","references":[]},{"id":"money/tax","webTitle":"Tax","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/tax","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/tax","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"money/pay","webTitle":"Pay","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/pay","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/money/pay","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/special-supplement/special-supplement","webTitle":"Special supplement","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/special-supplement/special-supplement","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/special-supplement/special-supplement","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/special-supplement","webTitle":"Special supplement","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/special-supplement","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/special-supplement","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432547965","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395234402731/99035afe-7e7e-4ddc-bc95-a9a9b08e1d30-460x276.jpeg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"-","altText":"Chancellor George Osborne delivers his 2014 budget.","height":"276","credit":"-/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Chancellor George Osborne delivers his 2014 budget.

The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said that Labour would vote in favour.</p><p>Faiza Shaheen, a senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said the cap appeared driven by ideology rather than any bid to tackle the underlying causes of welfare dependency.</p><p>Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), said the welfare cap was no more than a gesture and kicked the problem of spending cuts into the next parliament.</p><p>\"Putting a number on the welfare cap without policies to deliver it is meaningless. If you are going to take money away from people you need to change policy and there is nothing to tell us how the cuts will be achieved.\"</p><p>Portes also derided the charter committing MPs to renewing the cap each year.</p><p>\"It is a gesture and no more meaningful than that. Parliament already votes on measures to change social security budgets, so a charter makes little real difference,\" he said.</p><p>Treasury forecasts show the bulk of the government's deficit reduction plans are to avoid tax rises in favour of attacks on social security spending. Ministers expect to impose £2bn of tax rises in 2015-16 compared to £21bn of welfare savings.</p><p>Osborne's welfare spending cap pushes the ratio of spending cuts to tax rises above 90% – higher than the government's stated 80% limit – although taking into account tax rises from the beginning of the parliament the Treasury said the 80% limit remained in place.</p><p>Welfare spending accelerated in the years before the crash as Labour increased tax credit payments and the housing benefit bill jumped. Current forecast spending of £119bn for 2015-16 is set to fall within the cap, which will rise in line with inflation to £127bn in 2018-19.</p><p>The elements of welfare spending that fall under the cap have increased by 58%, or £45 billion, since 2000-01.</p><p>Criticism of the welfare cap came as Osborne was forced to admit that his deficit reduction programme would not be significantly helped by higher than expected growth.</p><p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) lifted its forecast for GDP growth in 2014 to 2.7%, from the 2.4% predicted in December's autumn statement and 1.8% forecast at the time of last year's budget.</p><p>Recovery is forecast to continue for the next four years, speeding up a little in the first couple of years before settling back to the long term trend of 2.5% by 2018.</p><p>Yet this solid performance results in a limited reduction in public sector borrowing this year to £107.8bn, from £111.2bn on the OBR's last estimate.</p><p>Thereafter, the forecast for the underlying deficit was trimmed just £500m to £95.5bn in 2014-15, before falling more sharply to £75.2bn in 2015-16, £44.5bn in 2016-17 and an expected surplus of £4.8bn in 2018/19.</p><p>Osborne said the faster fall in borrowing would free up £24bn over the next five years that otherwise would have been added to the £1.24tn trillion debt built up since the financial crash.</p><p>Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"The government borrowing and debt forecasts are still horribly high, but they do look a lot better than they did in March 2013 and even modestly better than they did in last December's autumn statement.\"</p><p>Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi, said the OBR forecasts could prove to be conservative and the deficit could fall faster than expected. But he warned that the plan relied on the planned welfare cuts being pushed through, which he said was going to cause a huge battle inside and outside parliament.</p><p>\"If the post-election fiscal consolidation is implemented, then the UK's fiscal deficit should fall markedly further in coming years, with a surplus in prospect towards the end of the decade.</p><p>\"However, there are major political risks over this scenario, reflecting uncertainties over whether the post-2015 spending squeeze is politically deliverable, especially if the 2015 election produces a Labour-led majority or coalition government,\" he said.</p><p>James Meadway, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said the need to make huge cuts in welfare to meet deficit targets was detached from reality when four out of five new jobs created were in low-paid sectors and 80% of new jobs are in London.</p><p>\"Instead of real action to tackle falling real incomes and insecure employment, Osborne has once again concentrated on handouts for the least deserving. While the grinding programme of spending cuts continues, including a permanent welfare cap, big businesses will get tax breaks.</p><p>Mike Turley, head of public sector at Deloitte, the business advisory firm, said any future government would need to focus on welfare spending to make the public finances more sustainable.</p><p>\"Care does need to be taken, however, to ensure that capping welfare spending does not lead to increased costs elsewhere in the public sector.</p><p>\"Targeting certain benefits could add pressure to spending on education, social services, housing and policing, so the danger is that costs are simply displaced.</p><p>\"Building in accountability on welfare spending and ensuring that, if a future government breaches the cap, a statement will need to be made to parliament, adds some welcome governance into the system.\"</p><p>The latest figures for January from the Office for National Statistics showed a surplus of £4.7bn, which was less than the £6bn surplus recorded in the same month a year earlier. Experts blamed lower tax receipts, but the OBR said it expected stronger than expected growth to play a part in meeting its more optimistic targets for this year and next.</p>","headline":"Spending cap won't tackle causes of welfare dependency, say critics","trailText":"<p>Tax credits and housing benefit limited to £119.5bn in central plank of plan to cut the deficit</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395265571260/Man-in-wheelchair-006.jpg","wordcount":"1002","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-22T21:48:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/welfare-spending-cap-hit-disabled-low-paid","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/welfare-spending-cap-hit-disabled-low-paid","tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2014","webTitle":"Budget 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/budget-2014","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/budget-2014","references":[]},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/welfare","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/budget","references":[]},{"id":"profile/phillipinman","webTitle":"Phillip Inman","rcsId":"GNL359331","r2ContributorId":"16288","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/phillip_inman_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Phillip Inman is economics correspondent of the Guardian and Observer.

He reeled off a series of inexpensive but headline grabbing measures – including tax reductions on bingo, a penny off a pint of beer, £200m to repair potholes, and inheritance tax exemptions for emergency workers who lose their lives – but the fifth coalition budget since 2010 created more waves in the financial markets than it did at Westminster.</p><p>The City was stunned by reforms that will mean people will not have to take out annuities when they retire and will remove all restrictions on how new pensioners have access to their pension pots. Osborne revealed changes to tax-free Isas, the abolition of the 10% tax rate on savings and a new pensioner bond in addition to liberalising measures that will give those retiring new freedoms to keep their own savings.</p><p>The disillusionment of those aged over 50 with David Cameron's modernising project and the ultra-low interest rates of the past five years are seen by Downing Street as the single biggest force driving the Ukip surge.</p><p>Shares in companies selling annuities fell sharply after the chancellor said he wanted to help savers, a group hard hit by the record low 0.5% interest rate kept in place by the Bank of England for the past five years.</p><p>Osborne boasted that the UK economy was growing more quickly than any of its major industrial rivals and said a more rapid reduction in the budget deficit would save £42bn in debt interest payments.</p><p>But while the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said growth of 2.7% in 2014 and 2.3% in 2015 would be higher than anticipated, it predicted that this would be at the expense of slightly slower expansion in future years as the economy ran up against capacity constraints.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-432502894\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/19/ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/19/ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/19//ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/19/ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Osborne said austerity would need to continue after the election, when 90% of the deficit reduction was planned to come from spending cuts. The chancellor said his measures were designed to deal with the economy's long-term weaknesses.</p><p>\"The economy is continuing to recover – and recovering faster than forecast,\" he told the Commons. \"We're putting Britain right. But the job is far from done. Our country still borrows too much. We still don't invest enough, export enough or save enough.\"</p><p>In his response Ed Miliband said the budget did nothing to address falling living standards and said it ducked the challenge of reforms needed to energy, banking and housing. The Labour leader described the budget as the same old Tory trick \"running an economy of the privileged, by the privileged for the privileged\". The Liberal Democrats were cheered by the heavily trailed £500 increase to £10,500 in the tax-free personal allowance from next spring, but Osborne failed to heed calls from the Conservative right for increases in the threshold at which people start paying income tax at 40%.</p><p>Business groups hailed a doubling of government lending available to exporters to £3bn, a doubling of investment allowances to £500,000 until the end of 2015, and a package designed to cut the energy bills of UK manufacturers.</p><p>Environmental groups attacked the budget as anti-green but John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, said: \"It will put the wind in the sails of business investment. I struggle to find anything I am disappointed by.\"</p><p>TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"This was a pre-election budget, with its giveaways aimed at the better off rather than lifting the living standards of the many. It will be paid for by further years of austerity, public services brought to near collapse, public sector pay cuts and a welfare cap that bites into the safety net that any of us might need.\"</p><p>Labour said it would support Osborne's savings announcements provided the reforms did not lead to middle-class tax evasion, a reduction in overall savings ratio or leave pensioners in penury if they spent their savings at the outset of retirement, leaving them dependent on the state pension and means tested support.</p><p>Osborne presented the reforms as about extending choice, saying \"pensioners will have complete freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, anytime they want. No caps. No drawdown limits. Let me be clear: no one will have to buy an annuity.\" The current tax rules \"are a manifestation of a patronising view that pensioners cannot be trusted with their own pension pots\", he said.</p><p>\"It's a matter for people to choose how they spend their money,\" added Danny Alexander, the  Treasury chief secretary.</p><p>Osborne said savers would no longer face the current 55% penalty charge if they tried to take the rest of their pension after their tax-free lump sum, but would be taxed at marginal rates – meaning as little as 20% for most pensioners.</p><p>The reform means savers can take their whole pension as cash. The Treasury's forecasts suggest many will pull cash out of their , paying the normal rate of tax, leading to a windfall of £1.2bn in tax by 2018-19pension. The political risk for Osborne is the technical nature of the reforms, and the length of time before they come into force, will not be enough to ensure , the single group most likely to vote, pensioners are lured back to the Conservatives in time.</p>","headline":"Budget 2014: Osborne targets grey vote with savings and pensions reforms","trailText":"<p>Chancellor warns austerity will

policies are aimed at older voters and forget young and poor, say charities","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>George Osborne was accused of delivering a \"budget for those who already have\" while forgetting the young and the poor, as he delivered a range of pre-election policies aimed at older voters.</p><p>Charities and thinktanks had been looking for measures to help ease the cost of housing and get more people, especially the young and long-term unemployed, into jobs. However the speech focused on a core Tory audience of pensioners and those approaching retirement.</p><p>Institute for Fiscal Studies research shows savers – who got measures ranging from more generous Isas to state-backed bonds for the elderly – are more likely to be in the wealthiest half of the population.</p><p>In contrast, the poorest half are often families already in debt or saving nothing at all. Young people, many saddled with student debts, also barely save and tend not to make a start until their 30s or 40s, accumulating more as they get older.</p><p>\"The chancellor talked about making, doing and saving. This budget needs to work for those who are making do and can't save,\" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.</p><p>The young were mentioned just once in the chancellor's speech, when he extended a scheme to help small businesses employ an extra 100,000 apprentices.</p><p>Labour had feared Osborne could match their pledge of a guaranteed job for all unemployed young people. There was also talk of Osborne expanding tax breaks for employers hiring under-21s to those taking on workers under 25. Neither of these policies materialised.</p><p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation also pointed out that the budget delivered next to nothing for the lowest earners or those who do not have jobs. \"This is a budget for the people who already have,\" said the charity's chief executive, Julia Unwin.</p><p>Measures to ease the rising cost of housing, especially for the younger generation, were also notably absent, except for the confirmation of a garden city of Ebbsfleet, which has already been announced, and an expansion of the Help to Buy scheme – an Osborne scheme from earlier in the parliament.</p><p>Critics argue Help to Buy is actually fuelling higher house prices, disadvantaging future first-time buyers, while Labour claims the 15,000 houses planned for the new town in Kent fall far short of what is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>\"We think the budget is a missed opportunity,\" said David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation. \"Measures like Help to Buy are likely to stimulate demand for housing but the budget does not go far enough to boost the supply of homes needed to meet that demand.\"</p><p>Coalition ministers have repeatedly attempted to argue that their priority is tax cuts for the lowest earners by raising the level at which people start paying income tax from £10,000 to £10,500 – a policy originally championed by the Lib Dems. However, those earning below this threshold miss out on the tax cut.</p><p>\"Higher earners stand to gain up to five times more than the poorest from changes to personal tax allowances,\" said Puja Darbari, director of strategy at Barnardo's.</p><p>There was also little to address concerns about the rising cost of living, which was the first thing noted by Labour leader Ed Miliband when he stood up to respond to the budget. \"The chancellor spoke for nearly an hour. But he did not mention one central fact: the working people of Britain are worse off under the Tories,\" he said.</p><p>Osborne did freeze a green tax to save households £15 a year on their energy bills, while the 1p off beer duty, freeze on Scottish whisky and cider duty, and cut in the bingo levy will also provide modest help. However, the taxes that most affect the lowest earners – VAT and the lower level at which people start paying National Insurance compared with income tax – were unchanged.</p><p>There was also little detail on where a future axe would fall on benefits or how further public spending decisions will be made. The chancellor confirmed he would bring in a welfare cap of £119.5bn, with the state pension and unemployment benefits exempted from this. However, there was no certainty about how the cuts will be distributed.</p>","headline":"Chancellor accused of delivering budget 'for those who already have'","trailText":"<p>George Osborne's

The UK is going to take a long time to win back that particular trophy from the three ratings bodies now that so much of our deficit reduction is predicated on further swingeing cuts in public-sector spending. The two credit-ratings agencies that still give Britain the top accolade could join Standard &amp; Poor's and force us to join France and Italy on lower rungs of the credit ladder.</p><p>George Osborne has proved a deft handler of budget cuts in the past couple of years. Reductions in disability benefits and housing benefit have either been phased out or hit groups who lack political clout. Since the 2011 riots, social unrest has been limited.</p><p>Whitehall has learned to dodge head-on fights. Osborne also learned that his first two years of severe cuts and tax rises were politically and economically illiterate.</p><p>As Jonathan Portes, head of the National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research thinktank, said: \"Osborne tried accelerated fiscal reduction and saw that it didn't work. In fact, it made things worse. And though he said he was still implementing it, behind the scenes he was taking his foot off the accelerator.\"</p><p>According to Portes, the change of tack is why we now have growth and a feelgood factor that could prove to be sustainable for the rest of the decade.</p><p>However, Osborne needs to continue squeezing his budget and from this year has switched almost exclusively to achieving that aim with welfare spending cuts. There are many on the Tory backbenches squaring up for a fight – but just as many who fear a return to the riots that spread quickly from London to Salford, Nottingham and Bristol three years ago.</p><p>Osborne has balked at spelling out where the cuts would fall, though there are a few signals. Since 2011, attacks by public-sector unions have been muted once it became obvious that grade rises would be allowed even if annual pay increases were frozen.</p><p>Now there are large numbers of public-sector workers looking forward to grade freezes as well. Public-sector pension savings have caused huge upset. Osborne's decision to spend the money instead of saving for the moment, in 20 or 30 years, when funds are needed for pensions, will only make public-sector workers even angrier.</p><p>Councils are about to suffer another funding cut, one that will leave them 20% worse off between this year and the year after the election. The Home Office is staring at further cuts before 2015-16, as are most other departments.</p><p>As the Institute for Fiscal Studies – a respected financial thinktank – has pointed out repeatedly in the last two years, the government's insistence on protecting health and schools spending, as well as fencing off the international development budget, means cuts of 40% in many other departments.</p><p>Will these cuts be accepted without protest? It is not just Conservative backbenchers who are concerned. City economists such as Michael Saunders at Citi are sceptical too.</p><p>Politically, cuts will not only affect the low-paid and benefit claimants. It will also fuel the resentment felt by many Ukip supporters at cuts in defence spending. The department was allowed to roll over its savings from the previous year into 2013-14 as part of the 2013 budget. This one-year gift is likely to be forgotten as the service comes to rely on the Territorial Army to make up for further cuts in professional staff.</p><p>Preferably, the government would enjoy higher tax receipts to balance spending with income, but it is a measure of the lack of confidence in Whitehall at the UK's capacity to generate income that it is relying on spending cuts.</p><p>However, property remains a sure fire winner, at least in the boom times. Stamp duty on house sales is set to almost double in the next four years from £9.5bn to £18.1bn. Income tax will only inch higher in that time and corporation tax by a mere £4.5bn to £45.9bn.</p><p>It's partly why the UK's annual spending deficits have stayed higher than our continental partners. And its why S&amp;P remains wary of restoring the UK to its former AAA status, unlike Fitch and Moody's.</p>","headline":"Osborne's focus on public-sector cuts won't impress ratings agencies","trailText":"<p>Chancellor is focusing almost exclusively on welfare spending cuts to squeeze his budget</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395264219906/AAA-credit-rating-006.jpg","wordcount":"692","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-22T21:34:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/george-osborne-public-sector-spending-cuts-credit-ratings-agencies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/george-osborne-public-sector-spending-cuts-credit-ratings-agencies","tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2014","webTitle":"Budget 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/budget-2014","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/budget-2014","references":[]},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/budget","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/georgeosborne","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"business/rating-agencies","webTitle":"Rating agencies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/rating-agencies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/rating-agencies","references":[]},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-sector","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/financial-sector","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"politics/economy","webTitle":"Economic policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/economy","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"profile/phillipinman","webTitle":"Phillip Inman","rcsId":"GNL359331","r2ContributorId":"16288","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/phillip_inman_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Phillip Inman is economics correspondent of the Guardian and Observer.

He reeled off a series of inexpensive but headline grabbing measures – including tax reductions on bingo, a penny off a pint of beer, £200m to repair potholes, and inheritance tax exemptions for emergency workers who lose their lives – but the fifth coalition budget since 2010 created more waves in the financial markets than it did at Westminster.</p><p>The City was stunned by reforms that will mean people will not have to take out annuities when they retire and will remove all restrictions on how new pensioners have access to their pension pots. Osborne revealed changes to tax-free Isas, the abolition of the 10% tax rate on savings and a new pensioner bond in addition to liberalising measures that will give those retiring new freedoms to keep their own savings.</p><p>The disillusionment of those aged over 50 with David Cameron's modernising project and the ultra-low interest rates of the past five years are seen by Downing Street as the single biggest force driving the Ukip surge.</p><p>Shares in companies selling annuities fell sharply after the chancellor said he wanted to help savers, a group hard hit by the record low 0.5% interest rate kept in place by the Bank of England for the past five years.</p><p>Osborne boasted that the UK economy was growing more quickly than any of its major industrial rivals and said a more rapid reduction in the budget deficit would save £42bn in debt interest payments.</p><p>But while the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said growth of 2.7% in 2014 and 2.3% in 2015 would be higher than anticipated, it predicted that this would be at the expense of slightly slower expansion in future years as the economy ran up against capacity constraints.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-432502894\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/19/ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/19/ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/19//ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/19/ITNP_UK_BUDGET_ROUNDUP_1605_19_itndv_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Osborne said austerity would need to continue after the election, when 90% of the deficit reduction was planned to come from spending cuts. The chancellor said his measures were designed to deal with the economy's long-term weaknesses.</p><p>\"The economy is continuing to recover – and recovering faster than forecast,\" he told the Commons. \"We're putting Britain right. But the job is far from done. Our country still borrows too much. We still don't invest enough, export enough or save enough.\"</p><p>In his response Ed Miliband said the budget did nothing to address falling living standards and said it ducked the challenge of reforms needed to energy, banking and housing. The Labour leader described the budget as the same old Tory trick \"running an economy of the privileged, by the privileged for the privileged\". The Liberal Democrats were cheered by the heavily trailed £500 increase to £10,500 in the tax-free personal allowance from next spring, but Osborne failed to heed calls from the Conservative right for increases in the threshold at which people start paying income tax at 40%.</p><p>Business groups hailed a doubling of government lending available to exporters to £3bn, a doubling of investment allowances to £500,000 until the end of 2015, and a package designed to cut the energy bills of UK manufacturers.</p><p>Environmental groups attacked the budget as anti-green but John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, said: \"It will put the wind in the sails of business investment. I struggle to find anything I am disappointed by.\"</p><p>TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"This was a pre-election budget, with its giveaways aimed at the better off rather than lifting the living standards of the many. It will be paid for by further years of austerity, public services brought to near collapse, public sector pay cuts and a welfare cap that bites into the safety net that any of us might need.\"</p><p>Labour said it would support Osborne's savings announcements provided the reforms did not lead to middle-class tax evasion, a reduction in overall savings ratio or leave pensioners in penury if they spent their savings at the outset of retirement, leaving them dependent on the state pension and means tested support.</p><p>Osborne presented the reforms as about extending choice, saying \"pensioners will have complete freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, anytime they want. No caps. No drawdown limits. Let me be clear: no one will have to buy an annuity.\" The current tax rules \"are a manifestation of a patronising view that pensioners cannot be trusted with their own pension pots\", he said.</p><p>\"It's a matter for people to choose how they spend their money,\" added Danny Alexander, the  Treasury chief secretary.</p><p>Osborne said savers would no longer face the current 55% penalty charge if they tried to take the rest of their pension after their tax-free lump sum, but would be taxed at marginal rates – meaning as little as 20% for most pensioners.</p><p>The reform means savers can take their whole pension as cash. The Treasury's forecasts suggest many will pull cash out of their , paying the normal rate of tax, leading to a windfall of £1.2bn in tax by 2018-19pension. The political risk for Osborne is the technical nature of the reforms, and the length of time before they come into force, will not be enough to ensure , the single group most likely to vote, pensioners are lured back to the Conservatives in time.</p>","headline":"Budget 2014: Osborne targets grey vote with savings and pensions reforms","trailText":"<p>Chancellor warns austerity will

death of a man as he was being deported from the UK.</p><p></p><p>Jimmy Mubenga, 46, died after being restrained by the three on board a plane at Heathrow airport in October 2010.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday the Crown Prosecution Service said the guards, Stuart Tribelnig, 38, Terry Hughes, 53, and Colin Kaler, 51, would be charged with manslaughter.</p><p></p><p>Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of CPS special crime, said: \"There is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig.\"</p><p></p><p>Mubenga's wife, Adrienne Makenda Kambana, said: \"\"My children and I have waited a long time for this decision. We hope the CPS will now move this case forward quickly. We feel like we are another step closer to getting justice for Jimmy.\"</p><p></p><p>The three guards were arrested following Mubenga's death but in 2012 the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring any charges against them.</p><p></p><p>That decision was reviewed following an inquest into Mubenga's death last year in which a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing following an eight-week hearing.</p><p></p><p>McHaffie said: \"We have completed a fresh review of all of the evidence relating to the death of Jimmy Mubenga, including the new evidence arising from the inquest, and decided that three men should be prosecuted for manslaughter.\"</p><p></p><p>The CPS said it had decided not to prosecute G4S for corporate manslaughter.</p><p></p><p>\"We have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute G4S for either offence and, due to the fact that related proceedings are now active, it would be inappropriate to comment further,\" it said in a statement.</p><p></p><p>Mubenga and his wife came to the UK in 1994. His family says that as a student leader in Angola he had fallen foul of the regime and was forced to flee. After a protracted legal battle he was granted exceptional leave to remain and he and Kambana moved to Ilford in Essex, where they set up home with their five children.</p><p></p><p>In 2006 Mubenga was convicted of actual bodily harm and sentenced to two years in prison following a brawl in a nightclub.</p><p></p><p>After serving his sentence he was transferred to an immigration detention centre and the process to deport him began.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday the family's solicitor, Mark Scott, welcomed the CPS's decision to prosecute the guards, adding: \"It has been a three-and-a-half year struggle for the family to get to this point and they hope to get on with their lives once this final challenge is met.\"</p><p></p><p>The three guards are due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 7 April.</p><p></p><p>Solicitors for the three said they would be vigorously denying the charges. A statement on behalf of Hughes, Kaler and Tribelnig said: \"My clients are very disappointed with the CPS's decision, having previously been told after a very lengthy police investigation that no charges would be brought against them. They will be vigorously denying these charges in court.\"</p><p></p><p>Deborah Coles, co-director of the Inquest campaign group, which has supported Mubenga's family, said the CPS's decision \"reiterates the importance of legal aid for families to be represented at inquests\".</p><p></p><p>\"It is legal aid that ensured a robust examination of all the evidence, which has ultimately resulted in today's welcome decision. The cuts to legal aid mean that cases like this in the future may well not receive this kind of scrutiny.\"</p>","headline":"Jimmy Mubenga: three G4s guards to be charged with

girls – were among 12 over six years up to 2010 being examined by officers in which a man entered holiday accommodation, mainly villas occupied by British families.</p><p>In six of those incidents, the man, said to be dark-haired and tanned, sat on the victims' beds. In nine of the 12 incidents there was no evidence of forced entry or property taken. In three others there was \"low-level\" theft involving cash or phones. Police said he appeared to have \"a very, very, unhealthy interest\" in young white girls.</p><p>The man, said to be unshaven with unkempt hair, spoke English slowly, with a foreign accent, possibly with slurred speech. Some witnesses suggested he had a pot belly while three victims suggested he had a distinctive smell, one involving aftershave, another tobacco while a third just described \"a funny smell\".</p><p>However, no children were abducted.</p><p>Detectives said there had been an increase in criminality and burglary in Praia da Luz that peaked in April 2007, shortly before Madeleine's disappearance.</p><p>Scotland Yard also revealed it was looking at 38 \"people of interest\" in relation to her disappearance, having dismissed 22 others from that category. They were also trying to find out more about 530 known sex offenders – 59 regarded as of high interest – across Europe.</p><p>However Portugal's Polícia Judiciária (PJ) claimed that Wednesday's press conference simply confirmed a primary line of investigation which has been investigated by Portuguese police since last October. Suggestions that the information released by the Met had initially been discounted by Portuguese detectives were denied by a source at the PJ's headquarters in Lisbon.</p><p>He said that evidence of a string of crimes had been the driving force behind Portuguese officials re-opening the case. \"It is all there in the police case files,\" said the source. \"You will see when it is made public.\"</p><p>Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, have been informed of the latest developments.</p><p>Clarence Mitchell, spokesman for the McCann family, told the BBC: \"Kate and Gerry still believe that Madeleine is alive and out there to be found, and that is why they are so pleased that the British police are doing such a good job on this.\"</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, in charge of the hunt for Madeleine, accepted there were differences between these cases and that of Madeleine's disappearance but added that there was a possibility that she had not left her family's holiday apartment alive when she disappeared in May 2007.</p><p>In most cases now being examined, the incidents happened between 2am and 5am – later than in the disappearance of Madeleine, then aged three, from a ground floor apartment at the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz while her parents had dinner with friends at a nearby restaurant.</p><p>Redwood said the assumption that Madeleine had been alive when she left the apartment \"may not follow with all our thinking\" on the case.</p><p>\"These offences are very serious and no one has been charged in connection with them. We also need to eliminate this man from our inquiries and ascertain whether these offences are linked to Madeleine's disappearance,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you have been a victim of a similar crime please come forward even if you reported the incident to police in Portugal, or anywhere else, please do not assume we have been made aware of it.\"</p><p>There was also a \"very close resonance\" to some features of Madeleine's disappearance, said Redwood.</p><p>\"We really need to identify the offender, to bring to a close the trauma and the tragedy that these families have suffered, and then seek to establish whether this is connected to Madeleine's disappearance.\"</p><p>He appealed for information and gave details of a distinctive burgundy long-sleeved top the attacker was said to have worn during two attacks – in the resort areas of Vale de Parra and Praia da Gale. On one occasion it was described as having a white circle on the back.</p><p>The appeal will also be made via BBC's Crimewatch on Wednesday night.</p><p>Redwood said if names were put forward for the most serious case of sexual assault, his team would be able to eliminate them from inquiries, suggesting the police may have DNA evidence.</p><p>Nine of the 12 incidents were reported to Portuguese police at the time but British investigators learned of three only when the victims came forward in response to televised appeals last autumn.</p><p>In the attacks, the suspect may have been in the villa or looking around the villa for some time before committing the offences or being disturbed either by a parent coming in, or the child waking up, say police. On two occasions the noise of a refuse collection lorry could be heard nearby.</p><p>Of the 12 offences being investigated,  four took place in Carvoeiro, six in Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale district, and two in Praia da Luz. Detectives have previously suggested Madeleine may have been abducted in a planned operation that had included individuals exploring the resort beforehand.</p><p>Scotland Yard issued efit images in October last year of a possible suspect with dark hair reportedly seen carrying a child with blond hair and possibly wearing pyjamas. The publication of the pictures on Crimewatch led to a huge response by the public and this man has still not been excluded from the police inquiry.</p><p>Efits of two fair-haired men seen near the McCanns' apartment were also released and police in the UK and Portugal have also been investigating break-ins around the resort, one of which occurred the same week a year before Madeleine disappeared and involved a man who entered a flat where young children were sleeping.</p><p>Fresh appeals were also made in Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany.</p><p>Scotland Yard has indicated its irritation with the slowness of the formal legal process that would allow its officers to work on the ground in Portugal. The Crown Prosecution Service has three so-called letters of request being considered by the country's legal system, among 33 from Britain on the case now being sent or prepared to be dispatched across Europe.</p><p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said: \"I am frustrated the legal process is as slow as it is.\" But he maintained: \"We are seeing an increase in the tempo of the investigation.\"</p><p></p><p>Scotland Yard says officers involved in the case have made 26 \"strategic and tactical\" visits to Portugal as well as travelling to Spain, Belgium, Jersey, Switzerland, Holland and Germany as well as working with colleagues across the UK. Police are asking members of the public with information to call them on 0800 0961011 within the UK. The number for non-UK residents is +44 207 1580 126. Callers can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>","headline":"Madeleine McCann police seek intruder who attacked girls at holiday homes","trailText":"Detectives investigating girl's disappearance look for dark-haired man who sexually abused five girls in Algarve","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395229123773/Madeleine-McCann-004.jpg","wordcount":"1135","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-22T11:43:29Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/madeleine-mccann-police-intruder-girls-algarve","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/madeleine-mccann-police-intruder-girls-algarve","tags":[{"id":"uk/madeleinemccann","webTitle":"Madeleine McCann","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/madeleinemccann","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/madeleinemccann","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jamesmeikle","webTitle":"James Meikle","rcsId":"GNL001970","r2ContributorId":"15777","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/james_meikle_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>James Meikle is a special correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesmeikle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jamesmeikle","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/topstories","webTitle":"Top stories","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432473210","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395229120363/Madeleine-McCann-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Everton Fc","altText":"Madeleine McCann","height":"54","credit":"Everton Fc/PA","caption":"Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in 2007:  police hav classed 38 people  as “persons of interest” to the inquiry.
