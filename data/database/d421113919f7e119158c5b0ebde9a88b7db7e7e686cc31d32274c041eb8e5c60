It's not naive to think we can have that, but it is naive to think we can just sit back and get it.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee has been an outspoken critic of the American and British spy agencies' surveillance of citizens following the revelations by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. In the light of what has emerged, he said, people were looking for an overhaul of how the security services were managed.</p><p>His views also echo across the technology industry, where there is particular anger about the efforts by the NSA and Britain's GCHQ to undermine encryption and security tools – something many cybersecurity experts say has been counterproductive and undermined everyone's security.</p><p>Principles of privacy, free speech and responsible anonymity would be explored in the Magna Carta scheme. \"These issues have crept up on us,\" Berners-Lee said. \"Our rights are being infringed more and more on every side, and the danger is that we get used to it. So I want to use the 25th anniversary for us all to do that, to take the web back into our own hands and define the web we want for the next 25 years.\"</p><p>The web constitution proposal should also examine the impact of copyright laws and the cultural-societal issues around the ethics of technology.</p><p>While regional regulation and cultural sensitivities would vary, Berners-Lee said he believed a shared document of principle could provide an international standard for the values of the open web.</p><p>He is optimistic that the \"web we want\" campaign can be mainstream, despite the apparent lack of awareness of public interest in the Snowden story.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say people in the UK are apathetic – I would say that they have greater trust in their government than other countries. They have the attitude that we voted for them, so let them get on and do it.</p><p>\"But we need our lawyers and our politicians to understand programming, to understand what can be done with a computer. We also need to revisit a lot of legal structure, copyright law – the laws that put people in jail which have been largely set up to protect the movie producers … None of this has been set up to preserve the day to day discourse between individuals and the day to day democracy that we need to run the country,\" he said.</p><p>Berners-Lee also spoke out strongly in favour of changing a key and controversial element of internet governance that would remove a small but symbolic piece of US control. The US has clung on to the Iana contract, which controls the dominant database of all domain names, but has faced increased pressure post-Snowden.</p><p>He said: \"The removal of the explicit link to the US department of commerce is long overdue. The US can't have a global place in the running of something which is so non-national. There is huge momentum towards that uncoupling but it is right that we keep a multi-stakeholder approach, and one where governments and companies are both kept at arm's length.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee also reiterated his concern that the web could be balkanised by countries or organisations carving up the digital space to work under their own rules, whether for censorship, regulation or commerce.</p><p>We all have to play a role in that future, he said, citing resistance to proposed copyright theft regulation.</p><p>He said: \"The key thing is getting people to fight for the web and to see the harm that a fractured web would bring. Like any human system, the web needs policing and of course we need national laws, but we must not turn the network into a series of national silos.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee also starred in the London 2012 Olympics, typing the words \"this is for everyone\" on a computer in the centre of the arena. He has stuck firmly to the principle of openness, inclusivity and democracy since he invented the web in 1989, choosing not to commercialise his model. Rejecting the idea that government and commercial control of such a powerful medium was inevitable, Berners-Lee said it would be impossible: \"Not until they prise the keyboards from our cold, dead fingers.\"</p><h2>Creator of web free to use for everyone<br /></h2><p>As a boy growing up in south-west London, Tim Berners-Lee was a keen trainspotter, which led to his interest in model railways and then electronics.</p><p>But computers were already familiar concept in the family home – both his parents worked on the creation of the world's first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mk1.</p><p>Berners-Lee got a first in physics at Oxford and then worked in a series of engineering roles. But it was at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in Geneva where he embarked on projects which would lead to the creation of the world wide web.</p><p>His aim was to allow researchers all over the world to share documents and his first proposals were judged as \"vague but interesting\" by a manager at Cern.</p><p>He combined existing technology such as the internet and hypertext and combined them to produce an immense interconnected document storage system. Berners-Lee labelled it the world wide web, although his Francophone collaborators found it difficult to pronounce.</p><p>The web was first open to new users in 1991, and in 1992, the first browser was created to scan and select the millions of documents which already existed.</p><p>Although the web has seen the creation and loss of countless fortunes, Berners-Lee and his team ensured that it was free to use for everyone.</p><p>Berners-Lee now works through various organisations to ensure that the web is accessible to all and that the concept of the neutrality of the net is observed by governments and corporations. </p>","headline":"An online Magna Carta: Berners-Lee calls for bill of rights for web","trailText":"<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> web's inventor warns neutrality under

<figcaption>Edward Snowden talks NSA and internet surveillance at SXSW</figcaption> </figure> <p>Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower whose unprecedented leak of top-secret documents led to a worldwide debate about the nature of surveillance, insisted on Monday that his actions had improved the national security of the United States rather than undermined it, and declared that he would do it all again despite the personal sacrifices he had endured.<br></p><p>In remarks to the SXSW culture and technology conference in Texas, delivered by video link from his exile in Russia, Snowden took issue with claims by senior officials that he had placed the US in danger. He also rejected as demonstrably false the suggestions by some members of Congress that his files had found their way into the hands of the intelligence agencies of China or Russia.</p><p>Snowden spoke against the backdrop of an image of the US constitution, which he said he had taken an oath to protect but had seen “violated on a mass scale” while working for the US government. He accepted praise from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web,  accorded the first question via Twitter, who described him as “acting profoundly in the public interest”.</p><p>The session provided a rare and extensive glimpse into the thoughts of Snowden, granted temporary asylum by Russia after the US revoked his passport.  He struck back strongly against claims made again last week by the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, that his release of secret documents to the Guardian and other outlets last year had weakened American cyber-defences.</p><p>“These things are improving national security, these are improving the communications not just of Americans, but everyone in the world,” Snowden said. “Because we rely on the same standard, we rely on the ability to trust our communications, and without that, we don’t have anything.”</p><p>He added later that thanks to the more secure communication activity that had been encouraged by his disclosures, “the public has benefited, the government has benefited, and every society in the world has benefited”.</p><p>Snowden rejected claims that potential adversaries of the US, such as Russia and China, had obtained the files he had been carrying.  “That has never happened, and it is never going to happen. If suddenly the Chinese government knew everything the NSA was doing, we would notice the difference,” said Snowden, noting that US infiltration of Russia and China was extensive.</p><p>He sharply criticised Alexander and Michael Hayden, his predecessor as NSA director, as the two officials to have most “harmed our internet security and actually our national security” in the era since the September 11 terrorist attacks by “elevating offensive operations” over cyber-defence.</p><p>“When you are the one country in the world that has a vault that is more full than everyone else’s, it doesn’t make any sense to be attacking all day and never defending your vault,” he said.</p><p> “And it makes even less sense when you let the standards for vaults worldwide have a big back door that anyone can walk in.”</p><p>The 30-year-old also claimed that by spending so much effort on harvesting communications data en masse, US security agencies were failing to pick up would-be terrorists such as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the brothers alleged to have bombed last year’s Boston Marathon, who had been previously flagged to the US as a cause for concern by Russian authorities. “We are monitoring everyone’s communications rather than suspects’ communications,” he said. “If we hadn’t spent so much on mass surveillance, if we had followed traditional patterns, we might have caught him.”</p><p>Snowden also pointed to the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called “underwear bomber” who attempted to blow up a plane bound for Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. The US failed to intercept him despite several opportunities, including a warning from his father to US officials in Nigeria.</p><p>An audience of 3,500 packed into an auditorium in Austin applauded several of Snowden’s answers to questions from a pair of onstage moderators and others submitted through Twitter.  Despite a glitchy and intermittent video link that he said was running through seven proxies, Snowden looked relaxed and confident.</p><p>He said that while the US has “an oversight model that could work” to guard against excess by intelligence agencies, in reality it had proved ineffectual. “The problem is when your overseers are not interested in oversight,” he said, and “champion the NSA instead of holding them to account”.</p><p>James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/obama-admits-intelligence-chief-fault-senate-testimony\">admitted to not telling the truth</a> when he told a congressional hearing last year that the government was not “collecting data on millions of Americans”. Snowden said Clapper had shown officials “can lie to the country, lie to the Congress, and face not even a criticism”.</p><p>He claimed that the behaviour of the US in online surveillance policy would only encourage the rest of the world to do the same, endangering the privacy of all citizens. “If we don’t resolve these issues, if we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to continue, and that is not what we want,” he said.</p><p>Snowden stressed that his message to technology firms such as Facebook and Google was “not that you can’t collect any data” but rather “that you should only collect the data, and hold it as long is necessary, for the operation of your business”.</p><p>He recently became the victim of a hacking when a scan of his US passport was released online, having been taken from the files of a professional organisation that gives certification to “ethical” hackers. “I submitted those forms back in 2010,” said Snowden. “Why was that still on a web-facing terminal?”</p><p>He encouraged ordinary internet users to protect themselves against surveillance by encrypting both their hard drives and their online activity, describing encryption as “the defence against the dark arts in the digital realm”. He also advised people to browse the web anonymously using the Tor system.</p><p>He urged software developers to create more user-friendly secure communications tools that could “pass the Glenn Greenwald test”, referring to Greenwald’s inability to communicate securely using PGP encryption when he first approached the journalist, then working for the Guardian.  However, he warned: “If you are a target of the NSA, it is game over no matter what unless you are taking really technical steps to protect yourself.”</p><p>Despite now being unable to return to the US, where he faces a criminal indictment, a defiant Snowden said he did not regret his decision to orchestrate the biggest leak in the history of US intelligence. “Would I do this again? The answer is absolutely yes,” he said. “Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we had a right to know.”</p><p>By the end end of his interview, the audience was on its feet to deliver a standing ovation. Snowden smiled and looked slightly embarrassed, before being abruptly cut off by the end of the video call, when the screen fell blank.</p>","headline":"Edward Snowden discusses NSA leaks at SXSW: 'I would do it again'","trailText":"NSA whistleblower speaks to SXSW from Russia to dispute claims by US officials that his disclosures harmed the country","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/10/1394478333143/ed98e3e1-eff3-4d95-9b12-4e868f30d36f-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1145","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-13T15:15:25-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/edward-snowden-nsa-leaks-sxsw","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/10/edward-snowden-nsa-leaks-sxsw","tags":[{"id":"world/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/edward-snowden","references":[]},{"id":"technology/sxswi","webTitle":"SXSWi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/sxswi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/sxswi","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/nsa","webTitle":"NSA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/nsa","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/surveillance","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"culture/sxsw","webTitle":"SXSW","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/sxsw","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/sxsw","references":[]},{"id":"world/the-nsa-files","webTitle":"The NSA files","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/the-nsa-files","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jon-swaine","webTitle":"Jon Swaine","r2ContributorId":"60922","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jon Swaine is a US correspondent based in New York.

He cited Pew research which found that 88% of Americans say they have taken steps to protect their privacy in some form. </p><p>“With all the user interface brains out there we could get easier tools,” he said. “But it’s not just the ability to encrypt, it’s a frame of mind, a workflow and a discipline that is alien to most people, and that is the opposite to the open nature of the consumer internet. You could use Tor to access a site a hundred times, but the 101st time you forget, you may as well not have used Tor.”</p><p>“There are people at this conference who have taken very considerable risk to protect the privacy of their customers and have put themselves at the edge of the door to jail and it will take courage as well as ingenuity to change the way things work.”</p><h2>Metadata is more powerful than phone tapping</h2><p>Gellman, who interviewed Snowden in Russia in 2013, said Snowden has highlighted the peak indifference to security. Metadata is incredibly potent as a method of surveillance, yet most internet users fail to understand how powerful it can be in aggregate. </p><p>“One of the great gifts of Snowden is that he has shown what surveillance can do,” he said. Gellman told of a colleague who said he wasn’t concerned about metadata and his privacy, a colleague who used Twitter heavily and with location stamps. </p><p>So Gellman downloaded three months worth of Twitter location stamps and plotted them on a Google map, plotting the times, frequency and significance of each location. His horrified colleague consequently changed much of his behaviour online.</p><p>“I would rather someone listened in to all my phone calls than accessed my metadata - you can learn much more about me from that metadata.”</p><h2><b>Whistleblowers - traitors or lantern bearers?</b></h2><p>Gellman doesn’t like the word ‘whistleblower’. On one side are many in government who say he signed an agreement not to disclose information, and that disclosing specific unlawful behaviour, or waste, should be dealt with by internal channels. Snowden himself did speak to around ten supervisors and to colleagues informally with some questions about their work, and at one point asked if what they were doing would pass ‘the front page test’.</p><p>“That’s a pretty bold thing to do when you’re gathering documents and speaking to three reporters,” he said. “But the illegality test is too narrow. </p><p>“If the idea is genuine that the government works for us, and information is power, we are living inside a one-way mirror because they know more and more about us and we know less and less about them. There’s a huge disparity of power.”</p><p>“Do we think it’s a good idea to listen to every call, to bust encryption standards… if it’s a big policy question, and stuff is being done behind our backs that might shock us if we knew about it, there’s pretty good reason to put it out there. Forget whistleblower - it should be lantern holder.”</p><h2><b>How has the NSA surveillance story stayed live?</b></h2><p>“Snowden paid very careful attention to what had happened to other whistleblowers that hadn’t had a long-term impact, and was careful to produce the documents… If Snowden had asked me 6-8 months later [if this story and still been live] but he has got to have exceed every plausible estimation about impact. It’s because he didn’t realise the documents all at once.”</p><p>That pace was less about Snowden releasing the documents slowly but about the work journalists need to do to verify and interrogate before they publish.</p><p>Doctorow said he was most concerned by the programmes known as Bullrun in the US and Edgehill in the UK, which saw the NSA spend $250,000 a year spend trying to sabotage security standards and have backdoors built into security products. </p><p>“In the second world war, countries had their own encryption tools but now we share networks and tools, and if you can undermine the random number generator - if you can make it less random - and that’s what the NSA was doing by trying to trick, buy or persuade companies to make their encryption more breakable,” said Gellman. “They would create an encryption standard that only they would break - that would let them be both information assurance and signal intelligence.”</p><p>Was Prism effectively a front for the more substantial fibre optic and undersea cable tapping? Interviewing Gellman, Cory Doctorow said: “The reason for Prism was to give them a plausible reason to know about the things they knew from the fibre taps  and not alerting the companies.” When Prism started Twitter barely existed, Facebook was limited to college campuses and Google was tiny.</p><h2><b>How did Snowden get the documents out?</b></h2><p>Asked whether he has been harassed when writing about Snowden, Gellman said no. </p><p>“I have not been harassed. I’ve had some interesting exchanges with government reps of various temperatures. But I speak to them before every story. If they want to demonstrate falsity I want to hear it, and if they want to tell me about specific damage I would be doing then it want to hear that too. I get warnings about the espionage act and I assume that I’m more interesting than I used to be. And Google has warned me that they believe a state-sponsored hacker is attempting to compromise my computer… I assume that is more likely to be a foreign agency.”</p><p>“Do I worry about doing harm and putting lives at risk? Of course I do. There are things in the documents I don’t think should be published and there are things Snowden doesn’t think should be published… </p><p>“He’s a very smart guy on a lot of levels, and a very nimble mind. There lots of boundaries he draws with me, and as  a reporter I look for side-channel attacks… Genghis Khan didn’t try to known down the Great Wall of China - he bribed the guards and put up ladders. But he Snowden won’t tell me how he got the documents out, for example.”</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/09/google-23andme-anne-wojcicki-genetics-healthcare-dna\"><b>23andMe admits FDA order ‘significantly’ hampered its business</b></a></p>","headline":"Snowden has shown the 'huge disparity of surveillance and power', says Gellman","trailText":"Government needs reminding that they work for us, says Pulitzer-winning reporter Barton Gellman, who describes Edward Snowden as ending an era of indifference to surveillance.

an $3tn industry that makes more money from illness than from prevention, founder Anne Wojcicki says genetics will become the basis for cheap, personalised healthcare</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Genetics will be a cheap and critical part of daily life, 23andme co-founder Anne Wojcicki has told the SXSW festival, claiming that genetics should be used for preventative medicine to bring down the cost of healthcare.<br></p><p>Sketching out the scale of an industry worth more than $3 trillion, Wojcicki said that working on Wall Street, she had seen how the industry has a profit incentive for illness, making money from everything from flu to diabetes and obesity.<br></p><p>“Obesity is awesome from a Wall Street perspective,” she said. “It’s not just one disease - there are all sorts of related diseases to profit from.” </p><p>Wojcicki described how the industry makes money on everything from sleep apnoea and diabetes drugs to specialist bathing systems and wound care. Growth is good for business - even if that growth is increased rates of obesity and related diabetes that is predicted to rise to 10% of the world’s population.</p><p>Part of the economic incentive is that treatment makes more money than prevention. Five per cent of people are pre-disposed to blood clots, yet doctors don’t routinely screen women who take birth control pills because it is cheaper to treat them if they develop a blood clot.</p><p>Wojcicki said she was dismissed by one doctor who said: “The problem with 23andMe is that you generate non-billable information.” The US health industry generates $2.7 trillion in expenses, so the aim is to maximise the billing.<br></p><h2>We are pioneers</h2><p>Wojcicki admitted the move by the US Food and Drug Administration service in November to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/25/genetics-23andme-fda-marketing-pgs-screening\">stop 23andMe marketing its genetic testing service</a> had hampered the company.<br></p><p>“It has slowed up the number of people signing up,” she said. “But we have 650,000 people in our database and are being inundated with requests from academics and foreign partners. We have more of this data than anyone else in the world… </p><p>“We are pioneers. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs but we have lots of tenacity to push on through. It will take time money and effort to figure out the path forward.” That path involves submitting applications that detail 23andme as a medical device, she said.</p><h2>Genetics are the basis for personalised medicine</h2><p>“23andMe set out to try and change healthcare - this is not an easy business. This is not coffee shop in Austin. The system sucks and we have to do something to try to change it,” she said, adding that 23andMe is about preventative healthcare. </p><p>“The principle is that genetic information is the basis for personalised medicine - you don’t want to gee your child benadryl on an overnight flight to Europe if you know that it will make them hyper. Knowing your genetic health risks will help you make better decisions.”</p><p>The moment of discovery, or receiving details of any genetic conditions through a test, can become a trigger moment for someone to change their lifestyle and improve their health. She also explained that by choosing to allow their health data to be aggregated and studied by 23andMe’s scientific research team, customers are contributing to a giant pool of health care data that can help understand inherited diseases and conditions.</p><p>Genetics is going to become extremely cheap and part of our daily life, she said. In China, the Beijing Genome Institute is now the largest genome testing firm in the world, and Saudi Arabia, the UK and others are all strong in this area.</p><h2>Google monetizing gut bacteria?</h2><p>Interviewer Kara Swisher asked whether it was ethical that 23andme - whose investors include Google - should make money from gathering genetic information. “Do you need all this information? I don’t love Google having data on my gut bacteria - they will figure out how to monetize my gut bacteria.”</p><p>Wojcicki said 23andMe is legitimate in charging because it is providing a service. “One of the reasons we went direct to consumer is so that you own the data. If your insurance accompany pays they own it, but if you pay you own your own data, and if you then want to share it that’s your right.</p><p>“Privacy is the foundation of what we do, but we have found that people want to share this information - not on Facebook necessarily but with physicians and family… People don’t have to participate in our research, but some people have begged us to use their data because they have a fatal disease and want to do as much as they can to help future generations.”</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/09/google-sundar-pichai-android-chrome-sxsw\"><b>Google’s Sundar Pichai on wearable tech: “We’re just scratching the surface”</b></a></p>","headline":"23andMe admits FDA order 'significantly slowed up' new customers","trailText":"Battling an $3tn industry that makes more money from illness than from prevention, founder Anne Wojcicki says genetics will become the basis for cheap, personalised healthcare.

The web has much in common with its social values","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Shortly after the YouTube sensation that was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">Jeremy Paxman's October interview with Russell Brand</a>, Paxman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/05/paxman-politics-russell-brand-voting\" title=\"\">wrote a pithy column</a> about his disillusion with Westminster politics. In it, he explained that what makes politicians \"unappetising\" is their hunger for power, that they are drawn to politics because they want to be in charge. This observation stayed with me, resurfacing during a conversation with an equally disillusioned entrepreneur who told me that contemporary politicians are followers, not leaders.</p><p>Within the context of technology – an industry defined by those who pioneer the new – this couldn't be more true. Before the 2010 general election, I combed through the manifestos of every significant party to compare their plans for technology. It didn't take long. The only effort was from the Conservatives, who had picked on their traditional themes of entrepreneurialism and small business to stake out the fleshy looking UK startup scene.</p><p>One semi-successful election later and the coalition government launched the <a href=\"http://www.techcityuk.com/\" title=\"\">Tech City </a>initiative – in the Labour borough of Hackney – giving a name to a pre-existing cluster of successful developers, designers and entrepreneurs in east London. In the words of my entrepreneur friend, another initiative based on following rather than leading.</p><p>For 2014 the focus is now on introducing computer science to the national schools curriculum in September and the complementary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/15/year-of-code-needs-reboot-teachers\" title=\"\">Year of Code</a> initiative.</p><p>Throughout all of this, where has Labour been? No technology manifesto. No vision for how the technology community in Hackney and the rest of east London – the capital's most deprived and challenged areas – could unlock digital skills and training for a whole new generation of workers. While the Conservatives eased themselves skilfully into the established business networks of the startup community, where was Labour's voice on rebuilding this increasingly essential and vibrant British industry?</p><p>Labour has been missing a trick. What better precedent than the one set by the honourable Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the open world wide web that he conceived 25 years ago this month? The values of the open web, it could be argued, are inherently liberal. The neutrality, the democracy of the platform which Berners-Lee himself still campaigns to protect means that for everyone with access, the web is equal to all who use it. Upskilling, crowdsourcing and networked communities are all fundamental Labour values for a digital age.</p><p>The web has disrupted and torn open every industry in turn. In training and education, every enlightenment from changing a tyre to degree-level physics is available, usually for free, online. Study at home from YouTube, or join an online course. But the potential for upskilling and empowering individuals is vast.</p><p>What used to be called \"the wisdom of crowds\" could offer the public sector a structure for more openness and even funding. Crowdfunding sites now span everything from gadgets and musicians to sustainable energy and publishing. Combine the platforms with the principle of making every public sector open and accountable, in plain English, with highly visible objectives. Looking to a socially transformative project such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/12/zopa-business-lender-online-broker\" title=\"\">Zopa,</a> the peer-to-peer lending service, the impact could be significant.</p><p>And for community organisation, existing experiments around group-buying clubs could be formalised and expanded for the benefit of poorer communities. Others, such as <a href=\"http://www.streetbank.com/splash\" title=\"\">Streetbank,</a> encourage people to pass on goods or to use their time and skills to help neighbours; perhaps the most touching repercussion of our increasingly online lives is that real-world experiences are even more valuable.</p><p>Even the unions, of which a new generation is sadly ignorant and detached, have a powerful incarnation here, exploring how online networks can unify communities around shared goals. Given the insecurity of many low-paid jobs, sweeping benefit cuts, the extremely high cost of living and the anger over executive bonuses, the timing couldn't be better.</p><p>But there is finally movement. Most significantly, shadow home secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/02/labour-spy-agency-controls-cooper-snowden-files\" title=\"\">Yvette Cooper</a>  has recently outlined how oversight of the UK's security services might be overhauled under a Labour government. The current system is unsustainable and will lead to a breakdown of public trust, she argued, stating that legislation needs to be brought up to date with technology.</p><p>It is a belated but important moment in the public debate post <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Snowden</a>, and one in which informed and long-sighted UK politicians are essential. The muted UK reaction and debate stands in stark contrast to the US, where, critically, the wealthy and powerful tech lobby has its roots in the web libertarianism of Silicon Valley and defends its independence ferociously.</p><p>In the UK, our relationship with the web is perhaps less emotive. But we need a strong and technologically confident Labour party to interrogate this government's flaccid approach to the universal right to privacy and its unwillingness to engage in a meaningful debate over the acceptable limits of state security surveillance.</p><p>We also need a Labour party that can seize the stage for this debate on its own terms, backing it up with a compelling vision for a new era in which the internet empowers, organises and unifies the citizens of the UK. Social and vocational opportunity on that scale would be a truly great achievement for British engineering – and that really would be a manifesto worth following.</p>","headline":"We need long-sighted and informed politicians in the technology debate","trailText":"<p><strong>Jemima Kiss: </strong>The coalition launched Tech City and is introducing computer science to the curriculum, but Labour has been missing a trick.

He claimed that 97% of Fortune 500 companies have admitted they’ve been hacked - the other 3% just aren’t ready to admit it yet.</p><p>The consequent rise in cybercrime and state-sponsored attacks has not gone unnoticed. 100 nations now have cyber command, and the Pentagon’s own briefings, which contained the word ‘cyber’ 12 times during 2012, have already mentioned it 147 times so far this year.<br></p><p>Yet former head of US homeland security Janet Napolitano once told Singer. “Don’t laugh, but I just don’t use email at all,” Singer recalled. “It wasn’t a fear of privacy or security - it’s because she just didn’t think it was useful. A supreme court justice also told me ‘I haven’t got round to email yet’ - and this is someone who will get to vote on everything from net neutrality to the NSA negotiations.”<br></p><p>Obama himself, Singer said, had expressed concern that the complexity of the issue was overwhelming policy makers.<br></p><p>Singer added that another US official about to negotiate cybersecurity with China asked him to explain what “ISP” meant. “That’s like going to negotiate with the Soviets and not knowing what ‘<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile\">ICBM</a>’ means. And I’ve had similar experiences with officials from the UK, China and Abu Dhabi.<br></p><p>At the G20 conference diplomats were spearfished by an email with a link to nude photos of former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and many clicked - downloading spyware onto their computers.<br></p><p>“Cybersecurity is crucial, and as intimate to your life as your bank account. It’s treated as an area only for IT folk, and the technical community that understands the hardware and software but not the wetware - the  human side. Without proper tools we cannot understand both what is possible and what is proper. Past myth and future hype weave together to obscure to what actually happen with where we will be in the future.”<br></p><h2>Cybersecurity should be treated like public health</h2><p>Singer also said many cybersecurity threats and solutions are misrepresented or overblown. Power lines are taken down far more often by squirrels, for example. The government response is often too reactionary - akin to the treatment of pirates and privateers in the age of sail - whereas investment in a public cyberhealth campaign would be far more effective.<br></p><p>“Ben Franklin said an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says that is true of public health but it is also true of cybersecurity… very basic cyber hygiene would go an very long way. The top control measures would stop 90% of all cyber attacks.”<br></p><p>The most significant penetration of US secure networks happened when an infected USB stick was dropped in the car park after a ‘<a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/06/yet_another_peo.html\">candy drop</a>’; an employee picked it up and plugged it into his computer on their secure network. “That’s not cyber hygiene, that’s basic hygiene - the five second rule.”<br></p><p>Another problem is that different parts of government operate in contradiction to each other. “Tor was originally paid for by Navy money, and pushed by state departments as a way of dissidents and state departments to protect themselves simultaneously, but if you use it you get swept up by the NSA who assumes you are up to no good. We have to figure out these balances.”<br></p><h2>Snowden - traitor or hero?</h2><p>The argument over NSA surveillance has been reduced to bumper sticker values, Singer argued.<br></p><p>Three different kinds of activity have been exposed. The first is that the NSA carries out espionage against American enemies - smart, strategic espionage. The second is legally and politically questionable, and related to mass collection of American citizens’ information collected either directly by the agency or by its allies.<br></p><p>“The third is what you could kindly call unstrategic - or stupid - directly targeting close American allies and leaders and undermining American technology companies. People want to say Snowden was a traitor or a whistleblower and we pull from the bucket we care the most about, but that’s a bumper sticker way of talking about it because people can simultaneously do both good and bad actions.”<br></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/08/julian-assange-wikileaks-nsa-sxsw\"><b>Julian Assange tells SXSW audience: ‘NSA has grown to be a rogue agency’</b></a></p>","headline":"'What does ISP mean?' - how government officials are flunking security challenges","trailText":"Policy on national security and protection is in the hands of people without critical technological understanding, warns cybersecurity expert.

Now watch out for tiny flying cameras","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>We live in an age increasingly shaped by our attitudes to, and our definition of, privacy. It is arguable whether the state of privacy itself has ever been more comprehensively and routinely challenged, and in many ways our changing relationship with technology is at the heart of this.</p><p>Reviewing the privacy controversies of the last few years reveals how far our sense of acceptable \"inversion of privacy\" has shifted. Take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2014/feb/04/facebook-look-back-10-year-anniversary-video\" title=\"\">Facebook,</a> its billionaire founder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wallowing in the glory of his first decade in charge of one of privacy's biggest agents of change. Users first revolted when the site introduced the newsfeed — yet now it feels rather benign in terms of its challenge to our sense of privacy, as well as being the main reason for visiting the site.</p><p>The boundary between the public and the private is porous, a slew of privacy levels to dial round and push back, depending on the audience; one person might be happy to overshare baby photos publicly, while another won't entertain being part of Facebook's semi-public \"friends\" discussion. The company's developer-first principle of pushing out a feature and then adapting it after feedback from users may have been good for business, but has also helped edge back the boundaries of what we define as public.</p><p><strong>Zuckerberg back-pedalls </strong></p><p>Now that we have all largely accepted the oversharing norm, Zuckerberg himself – who not so long ago claimed that privacy was over – seems curiously to have back-pedalled, introducing anonymous logins for some of Facebook's new apps.</p><p>\"If you're always under the pressure of real identity, I think that is somewhat of a burden,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-30/facebook-turns-10-the-mark-zuckerberg-interview\" title=\"\"><em>Businessweek </em>last month</a>, acknowledging the competition from lower-profile, anonymous chat tools such as <a href=\"http://www.snapchat.com/\" title=\"\">Snapchat</a>.</p><p>Google has navigated a galaxy of privacy scandals. At one end of the spectrum, its <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/views/home?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=gb\" title=\"\">Street View </a>cameras have inadvertently recorded public sex acts, nose-picking, and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1332219/Google-image-naked-man-car-boot-snapped-Street-View.html\" title=\"\">a naked man climbing in the boot of his car</a> – and at the other end of the scale had to reassure consumers after a more prescient scandal about them sucking up personal information from <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-admits-to-collecting-user-data-over-unsecured-wifi-networks/\" title=\"\">unsecured wi-fi networks</a>.</p><p><strong>Ultra-smart gadgets</strong></p><p>Google has pledged that <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/glass/start/\" title=\"\">Google Glass</a>, its internet-connected tech specs, won't have image recognition switched on because of privacy concerns. \"Well, never say never, but we have said we wouldn't do it,\" executive chairman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/eric-schmidt\" title=\"\">Eric Schmidt </a>said when I asked if that was a permanent commitment. And then there's last month's acquisition of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/13/google-nest-labs-3bn-bid-smart-home-devices-market\" title=\"\">Nest Labs</a>, which makes ultra-smart gadgets for the home. Nest started with an internet-connected thermometer and then made a similarly wired-up smoke alarm; does this mean Google now has access to data inside your personal, physical space too?</p><p>\"These are conspiracy theories,\" Schmidt told me at the time. Crucially, his explanation was that Google relies on trust — lose that trust and Google loses the consumer.</p><p>Just as privacy isn't absolute, neither is trust. We find different levels of appropriate privacy or publicness and, as consumers, we need to trust a company only enough to give it our data. If the person using the site doesn't have any experience of revealing too much, or needing to keep some kind of issue private, that can't be a fair exchange to make. Schmidt used teenagers as an example.</p><p><strong>'It's not OK to invade privacy'</strong></p><p>\"Teenagers are not legally an adult for a reason. My advice to parents would be to know their passwords and monitor what they are doing.\"</p><p>He said that with a straight face, but it's a suggestion that will no doubt have the parents of teenagers rofling. Schmidt claims 90% of privacy violations are self-generated.</p><p>\"It's not OK fundamentally to invade privacy – just because we have the tools to invade privacy that doesn't make it right.\"</p><p>All these developments are framed by the biggest technology story of the decade – that our online lives are accessed, monitored and stored by the UK and US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">security services</a>. So we face surveillance in our online world, on our mobiles, on the street through CCTV and perhaps next in our own internet-connected smarthomes, plus social scrutiny of the parts of our lives we choose to display on social networks. Surely there can't be more to come?</p><p>Well, the next privacy scandal in waiting is the story of drones. Not military drones, but increasingly widespread use of drones for agriculture, disaster areas and emergencies, archaeology, forestry and property management, among others.</p><p>Drones are banned in London and can't be used below a certain height in residential areas. But how many uses could there be for a small, silent, fast, remote-controlled drone? How long before the first sunbathing politician is snapped on holiday? If the public is banned from a venue, or refused access to private land, or if a property is under siege from journalists, how long before a drone is used for high-quality aerial video?</p><p>The next time you step outside and head off for some time alone, remember to look up.</p>","headline":"Worried about your privacy?

According to Facebook, exactly 10 years after the social network was created, the future is called Paper. But it's not quite as nostalgic as it sounds. This is the future where we write, film and share our stories via our mobile phones. A sleek cut-down version of the Facebook site, Paper replaces buttons with touchscreen swipes, and uses full-screen to play video on the handheld devices, where the future of the internet will be fought.</p><p>But Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's 29-year-old founder, also wants to hire human editors to promote the most interesting content, harking back to newspapers themselves. In this case, the retro nomenclature represents something more: a desire to find new ways to make Facebook more relevant to the human desire for communication, by enlisting people themselves.</p><p>It is a sign that Facebook is looking to secure its place in the firmament by branching out into new forms of communication. By the end of 2013, Facebook was being used by 1.23 billion users worldwide, adding 170 million in just one year.</p><p>Yet the scale of the ambition is a far cry from when Zuckerberg was an ambitious and competitive freshman at Harvard. Immortalised in The Social Network, Zuckerberg launched the site from his dorm room on 4 February 2004 – a technological replacement for a college directory and messages left on student doors.</p><p>It was a hit almost immediately, although in today's terms the early progress sounds modest. In 2006, Facebook already had 12 million users across US colleges, 60% of whom logged in every day. But by then it was already valued at $100m (£61m).</p><p>Meanwhile, Zuckerberg himself may come to be known as the most underestimated man of his generation, steering Facebook from an idea to link students to the default communication platform for the online western world.</p><p>The site is now worth $135bn with revenues of $7.87bn in 2013, including $1.5bn in profit. Globally, 556&nbsp;million people now access the site every day on their smartphone or tablet and at the end of 2013, for the first time, Facebook made more than $1bn in revenue from mobile advertising in just one quarter.</p><p>Part of Facebook's success has been timing, says Dr Bernie Hogan, research fellow at the Oxford internet institute, because the world was ready for a shared list of connections that works like a supercharged, definitive phone book for the digital age. \"Before Facebook, we had to cover up our identities online and there was uncertainty over who to trust. Facebook gave us the notion that it was safe, and useful.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428895202'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391511321556/Facebookusers.png' alt='Facebook users' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Facebook's neutrality is partly why younger users are attracted to new and more edgy platforms such as the messaging app Snapchat, says Hogan, though they will a retain a presence on Facebook to show a safe, public face.</p><p>From its earliest days, Facebook has navigated – even pioneered – the territory around privacy, and how we express our personal identities online. This has been a precarious journey, and in September 2006 – before the site was open beyond the US college network – it was dealing with concern over the introduction of the newsfeed and over-sharing users' personal information.</p><p>In most cases, Facebook has adapted in response to feedback. Even the most controversial features it has eventually killed off – such as Beacon, which published users' purchases and related advertiser information in feeds – have still informed the site's development.</p><p>But as Facebook advanced it also helped create a world in which people live with dual identities –online and in real life. \"People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people,\" said Zuckerberg in 2010 during an intense few months as controversy raged over the complexity of Facebook's privacy settings. \"That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428895203'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/4/1391472127038/Mark-Zuckerberg-and-Dusti-008.jpg' alt='Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mark Zuckerberg, right, and one of the other co-founders of Facebook, Dustin Moskovitz, at Harvard University in 2004. Photograph: Getty Images/Boston Globe</figcaption></figure><p>But Zuckerberg's own attitude to real identities has shifted. Facebook's currency of real-world identities, both for users and advertisers, has been replaced with a recognition that for some exchanges – like those of rival messaging app Snapchat – anonymity and a different, less committed style of engagement are attractive.</p><p>\"I don't know if the balance has swung too far, but I definitely think we're at the point where we don't need to keep on only doing real identity things,\" he told BusinessWeek recently. \"If you're always under the pressure of real identity, I think that is somewhat of a burden.\"</p><p>Facebook has been aggressively exploring mobile since its IPO, when investors expressed concern that its strategy was too focused on desktop. Its repositioning as a mobile-first business has been nothing short of remarkable; Zuckerberg himself even removed his desktop screen from his desk and viewed the site purely on his smartphone. Becoming a mobile company was Facebook's most urgent priority, he told staff. In April 2012 he stunned the tech industry by paying $1bn for Instagram, a photo-sharing app with 100 million users.</p><p>\"Facebook is a bad investment,\" squealed a Forbes headline from 2012, cautioning that this looked like a defensive move to buy a mobile-ready rival. \"Facebook will have to fend off more and more young companies gnawing at its core. The odds are that Zuckerberg will one day face an opponent that can't be bought.\"</p><p>Criticised for being overvalued at the time of its 2012 flotation, Facebook got off to an uncertain start as a publicly traded company, but has since found its feet: floated at $38 a share, the stock now changes hands at $61.76.</p><p>Christopher Poole, founder of irreverent cult bulletin board 4chan, is critical of Facebook's concept of being a mirror to human identity. \"Relationships are not reducable to the things we do,\" Hogan says. \"Relationships are built on time spent together. On Facebook, you aren't saying: 'This is special because you did it with me.' You're saying: 'This is special because I did it.'</p><p>\"It's very healthy that we don't take Facebook too seriously, that we don't conflate selective moments with real, lived experience. We need to distinguish our exhibited selves from our real selves.\"</p><p>However, the Edward Snowden files, which revealed the extent of US and UK government surveillance of web users, brought with them a crisis of confidence. Many web businesses, like Facebook, have battled to convince users to trust them with their data, offering powerful, useful services for free in return for selling targeted ads.</p><p>Zuckerberg was one of those to speak out unambiguously after the first revelations. \"The government response was: 'Oh don't worry, we're not spying on any Americans.' Oh, wonderful: that's really helpful to companies trying to serve people around the world, and that's really going to inspire confidence in American internet companies. I thought that was really bad,\" he said.</p><p>Advertisers, however, do not appear to have been put off. Facebook accounted for 5.7% of all global digital advertising revenues in 2013, and 18.4% of mobile ad spend, according to eMarketer.</p><p>Venture capitalist Saul Klein, who worked with Facebook when with Skype, feels Zuckerberg has been hugely underestimated. \"What Facebook is doing with a site used by 1 billion people a day is an order of magnitude greater than anything – it's a remarkable feat of engineering,\" he said, pointing to the fact that London is still the only English-speaking city in Facebook's top 10. \"It's not just about the US anymore – tech is now a global phenomenon. I'm not sure even Facebook quite understands that – they are the canary in that coalmine.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, while many computer scientists have built successful companies, not least his idol Bill Gates, Facebook has arguably not just given engineers power but structured its very businesses processes in \"the hacker way\". An oft-repeated slogan on Facebook's office reads \"move fast and break things\", a strategy that means working in a continual state of developmentIts founder's self belief has been noticeable from the start. \"Zuckerberg always felt Facebook could be much bigger than anyone could see,\" said Klein. That belief also inspired a remarkable confidence to say no. Aged 22, Zuckerberg turned down a $1bn acquisition offer from Yahoo.</p><p>\"There is no CEO in the world that could walk in and do that job. There is no preparation for it – it is completely unprecedented. He has lots of self confidence, lacks ego and is very mature.\"</p><p>And as for the next 10 years? In 2024, Zuckerberg will not even be 40.</p><h2><strong>Likes and spikes</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>January 2004</strong> Mark Zuckerberg starts work on thefacebook.com</p><p><strong>February 2004</strong> Site launched by Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room with co-founders Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, Andrew McCollum and Eduardo Saverin.

That's what [chief executives] do, and they can lose their job every quarter.\"</p><p>The Google chairman dismissed Japan's political system as sclerotic, despite attempts by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to reform the country's economic policy, but said the US and Europe were suffering from the same lack of effective leadership.</p><p>\"In the American system, conventionally the only thing you can do in a presidency is in the first 18 months, because the system becomes so tough and the lobby is so powerful.</p><p>\"Europe seems to have accepted 12% unemployment for ever, and that is terrible.

That year, the company donated $715,000 to Republican candidates and $2.1m to Democrats. In December 2012, shortly after Obama's re-election, Schmidt reportedly turned down a role in Obama's administration as treasury secretary.</p><p>Schmidt has been the charismatic corporate voice of Google since he joined as chief executive in 2001. Now promoting his new book, The New Digital Age, written with a fellow Google executive, Jared Cohen, Schmidt outlines his vision of the future, where the requisite insights into the potential of artificial intelligence sit alongside warnings about how governments need to be prepared for technology threatening the jobs of the middle classes.</p><p>Everyone in the world is unhappy with their government, he believes. \"I would like to figure out a way to bring back a stronger model for leadership that is responsible and respectful, but capable of addressing things rather than just talking about them,\" he said. \"We lack the kind of leadership that will drive societies forward, and there's something wrong when it is so difficult to politically manoeuvre.\"</p><p>Schmidt still denies that he is interested in a career in politics; the question was rebutted with a brief \"no\".</p><p>But he is far more forthcoming about the achievements of Google: \"This is winning. We're making a difference, achieving things, so people will attack us, partly because people are afraid of change.</p><p>\"Our job is to invent things, to drive innovation, and there will be losers out of that.

China's VPN-using audience alone could be as much as 160 million people, many of whom are currently being incorrectly identified as being in another country - usually the US.&nbsp;</p> <p>Normally, the location of a user's IP address would be used to deliver relevant regional advertising as well as a version of the site in the local language.</p> <h2>Geo-located advertising 'missing the mark'</h2> <p>\"VPNs serve a perfect dual purpose for consumers in lots of markets, allowing them to access restricted content and better content as well as stay anonymous,\" said Jason Mander, GWI's head of trends. \"It's a perfect combination and one that is likely to see their popularity grow. It also means that the numbers using sites such as Facebook in China are likely to have been under-estimated, and that geo-located advertising is completely missing the mark for these internet users.\"</p> <p>\"The figures also suggest that the global internet audience is a lot savvier and more concerned about this type of thing than is traditionally supposed, and chimes with the statistic that 55% are concerned about their privacy being eroded by the internet.\"</p> <p>In Vietnam, VPN is used by 38% of the online population and in Brazil and Thailand 36%. Mexico, India and China all reported use by an estimated 34% of the population that has access to the internet, with the UAE and Argentina on 32%.</p> <p>The US, UK, Germany and Ireland meanwhile all report 17% penetration, with Japan the lowest at 5%. The data includes those aged 16-64 for the last quarter of 2013.</p> <p>The data also underscores the shift from text messaging to mobile messaging apps, with WeChat&nbsp;seeing a 379% increase in active users between the second and fourth quarters of 2013 to around 385 million users, 78m of whom are in China.</p> <h2>Instagram beats Facebook for growth, and younger users</h2> <p>Facebook has by far the biggest audience among social networks with an estimated 1.1 billion active users, but also has a very active user base with 56% saying they visit the site at least once a day.&nbsp;</p> <p>Facebook's $1bn acquisition of the photo-sharing site Instagram in 2012 proved a sound bet; GWI found it had the fastest growth of any social platform in 2013 adding 23% active users from Q2 to Q4 to reach 91 million users. Instagram also led the move of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/27/facebook-dead-and-buried-to-teens-research-finds\">younger web users away from more established social sites</a>.</p> <p>Along with Twitter, Facebook has the largest proportion of users aged 55-64, while Tumblr and Instagram have the highest share of 16-24 year olds at 45% and 39% respectively. Use by older people is compounded by the ageing of early-adopter users as well as older users being more likely to join established sites.</p> <p>The most common activity on Facebook was sharing content, private messaging and commenting on posts, while the least popular activity - which doesn't bode well for the site's advertising strategy - included complaining or commenting on a brand or sharing brand videos.</p> <p>MySpace, meanwhile, languishes at the bottom of the charts.

It seems almost impossible to remember what unconnected life was like; some of us are old enough to remember living without the web, old enough to have used typewriters at university, microfiches in the school library and can recall the first mention of something called \"Hotmail\".</p><p>It is nearly 25 years since Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote his initial proposal for a distributed information system based on hypertext, in March 1989. \"Vague, but exciting,\" was how supervisor Mike Sendall greeted the idea, proposed to help connect the work of several thousand atom-smashing scientists, researchers and administrators at Cern – the European home of nuclear research and the large hadron collider.</p><p>The plan was a non-linear organisation system based on hypertext –quite the hot topic in late 80s computing circles – that would improve on the previous system that let documents be stored and printed. \"A linked system,\" wrote Berners-Lee, \"would allow one to browse through concepts, documents, systems and authors, also allowing references between documents to be stored.\"</p><p>\"The aim would be to allow a place to be found for any information or reference which one felt was important, and a way of finding it afterwards. The result should be sufficiently attractive to use that it information contained would grow past a critical threshold, so that the usefulness of the scheme would in turn encourage its increased use.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee, with the help of colleague Robert Cailliau, later formalised the proposal and extended its ambitions to be a network for the world – the world wide web. By the end of 1990 Berners-Lee had put together the first server and web pages, and the first web browser for the NeXT operating system – this was the computer company founded by Steve Jobs during his interregnum from Apple. Another Cern colleague Nicola Pellow wrote a generic browser for other operating systems, and the first public page was published on 6 August 1991 at info.cern.ch.</p><p>Quite what scale of \"critical threshold\" Berners-Lee had in mind for the nascent project was not clear, but he could never have imagined the diversity, the ubiquity and the functionality of the web today in all the myriad forms we know.</p><p>Berners-Lee has been careful to credit decades of work by previous engineers who laid the foundations for the web. He has previously spoken out against Facebook and others for business models that rely on capturing information and keeping it in silos, away from the rest of the web, and has been outspoken in condemning government surveillance post the Edward Snowden affair.</p><p>In the public debate following those revelations, it has been argued that perhaps commercialisation and government control are inevitable for such a critical network at a global scale. Should we just accept that most of the public web, and the internet on which it runs, has reached a level of maturity where ownership and control becomes inevitable?</p><p>Berners-Lee thinks not, and has argued for the preservation of the web as a democratic tool. \"Bold steps,\" he said in response to Snowden, \"are needed to protect our fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and association online.\"</p><p>This ideology will only become even more critical as the web faces its next 25 years of commercial experimentation, as well as political influence and cyberwarfare. The web itself will mature into predictive tools and artificial intelligence, and an immersive, hyper-connected web in which seams of data run through every part of our personal, professional and physical lives, of the objects around us and the organisations in which we work. It is a future, Berners-Lee hopes, when that data is open and democratic.</p><p>\"Close to the principle of universality is that of decentralisation, which means that no permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the web, there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure,\" he wrote last year. \"This has been critical to the web's growth and is critical to its future.\"</p><p>Beyond open data and the fast being-realised semantic web, he is too wise to predict the direction the web will take, limited only by our imaginations. \"If we end up building all the things I can imagine we will have failed,\" he once said.</p><p>A distributed network is a democratic system, where information and power are equally distributed. Had he determined to patent and commercialise his idea from the outset, market forces would have inspired others to do the same, creating a network of competing, smaller webs, he has said.</p><p>\"We need to be able to find ways of governing ourselves in peace,\" he told the SXSW festival last year. \"We need to be able to find ways of coming to agreements with people in other countries, in other cultures, about what we are going to do with our planet and how we are going to solve global warming. For that, we need a very strong democracy. Democracy involves people being informed, being able to communicate, being able to hold each other accountable. And all that absolutely depends on the neutral internet.\"</p><p>The principle of one global, democratic communication network seems a reality that is slipping through our fingers. Curiously, by gifting the web to the world he has also retained an almost spiritual ownership of it.</p><p>Perhaps the real celebration should be for Berners-Lee's uncommon principle of not commercialising his invention by default; among all the noise and hyperbole and distraction of the common web, that is a rare and noble thing. And worth defending.</p>","headline":"Two decades on, we must preserve the internet as a tool of democracy","trailText":"Some 25 years after Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote his proposal, the challenge is to protect rights to privacy and freedom of opinion online","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2014/1/8/1389185993390/Sir-Tim-Berners-Lee-004.jpg","wordcount":"931","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-15T09:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/12/web-tool-democracy-tim-berners-lee","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/jan/12/web-tool-democracy-tim-berners-lee","tags":[{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jemimakiss","webTitle":"Jemima Kiss","r2ContributorId":"19589","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2013/11/8/1383915783233/Jemima-Kiss-2-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p><strong>Head of technology</strong> <br />Jemima Kiss joined the Guardian in 2006 and covers big tech businesses, startups and technology trends.<br />She is a permanent fixture on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/techweekly\">Tech Weekly</a> podcast and sits on the <a href=\"http://www.bjr.org.uk\">British Journalism Review</a> editorial board. <br />A proud graduate of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jun/01/dartington-college-arts-relocation-falmouth\">Dartington College of Arts</a>, Jemima has covered technology and media online since 2002.<br />Public key: OXF87DA69E</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jemimakiss","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jemimakiss","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/observer-tech-monthly/observer-tech-monthly","webTitle":"Observer Tech Monthly","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/observer-tech-monthly/observer-tech-monthly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/observer-tech-monthly/observer-tech-monthly","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/observer-tech-monthly","webTitle":"Observer Tech Monthly","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/observer-tech-monthly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/observer-tech-monthly","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426575539","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2014/1/8/1389185987576/Sir-Tim-Berners-Lee-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Martial Trezzini","altText":"Sir Tim Berners-Lee","height":"54","credit":"Martial Trezzini/EPA","caption":"Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, speaks at a press conference on human rights at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, last month.

Local authorities and councils the world over have invested in social capital and connected infrastructure with the aim of better understanding the needs of their citizens.</p> <p>The Watershed arts venue in Bristol, for example, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jun/27/hello-lamp-post-playful-cities\">organised a Playable City Award in 2013</a>, whose aim was \"to commission an original, future-facing work, that used creative technology to explore the theme of the playable city.\" London, meanwhile, has introduced bins that send text messages when they are nearly full and has used sensors installed under parking bays in the West End to relieve congestion in the area &ndash; and the city is manually moving Boris Bikes to bays people are cycling from but not cycling towards (generally, if it's at the top of a hill).</p> <p>In 2014, more cities will iterate and experiment. They'll implement new technologies to not only create a better connected city but to enhance the environment. That could include street lights switching on due to residents complaining about the lack of light on Twitter. There's a great number of opportunities available &ndash; and that's an exciting prospect. - <em><strong>Siraj Datoo</strong></em></p> <h2>Games</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5b565b5a-abba-4763-ba10-4a2421a7cb4f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388655563460/f02420a1-fa77-402e-b5c2-63b2d4c6aadb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bungie's Destiny game logo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Destiny from Bungie, creators of Halo, is set to make 2014 a year to remember.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Although the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launch games were largely disappointing, 2014 will certainly see both machines move up a gear. The twin giants of the release schedule will be the epic space opera Destiny from Bungie Software, and Titanfall, the new sci-fi shooter from Respawn Entertainment. This is basically the makers of Halo versus the creators of Call of Duty in one galactic face-off. There will be robot limbs and crashed space ships everywhere.</p> <p>And the carnage won't end there. 2014 is a year of gigantic action blockbusters. Ubisoft has its cyberpunk romp Watch Dogs, as well as the ingenious online multiplayer strategy shooter, The Division. The PS4 has intriguing steampunk adventure The Order: 1886, while Xbox One has the new post-apocalyptic thriller, Quantum Break, which ties in with and interacts with a TV series of the same name. We can expect more of this media crossover \"excitement\" as the barriers between games consoles and set-top boxes crumble.</p> <p>More intriguing perhaps is the rise of persistent online worlds and emergent simulations. We're getting three very interesting space exploration titles in the form of Star Citizen (from the creator of the legendary Wing Commander series), No Man's Sky from tiny UK studio Hello Games and Starbound, from another British developer, Chucklefish &ndash; the latter two promising vast procedurally generated galaxies.&nbsp;</p> <p>But closer to home, this will also be a year of ideas. From Chris Hecker's fascinating asymmetrical two-player body language game Spy Party, to Jonathan Blow's Myst-like adventure The Witness, to the storybook mythology of Tengami and the heartbreaking adventure title That Dragon Cancer, 2014 will mess with our heads and expectations of what games are. And if you don't want to be messed with, that's fine &ndash; there are sequels, so many sequels. Hotline Miami 2, Dark Souls II, Metal Gear Solid V and the hugely promising Elder Scrolls Online. 2014 will take a brave look at the future of gaming technology, but it will bring the past along for the ride. -&nbsp;<em><strong>Keith Stuart</strong></em></p> <h2>Patents</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d267cdda-40a9-489d-9e25-146e835dd70e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388655771653/f16b0cff-57c3-4289-8aa4-fe6505627671-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nokia Lumia 1020 smartphone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Nokia holds many key patents, and is not afraid to use them.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Sick of hearing about patent lawsuits between big-name tech companies? Bad luck &ndash; 2014 is going to bring more of them, after a relative lull in 2013. The part of Nokia that isn't being sold to Microsoft is sharpening its patent portfolio, and has begun exercising it successfully against HTC. Next in line is Google (particularly Google Maps) and other Android handset makers.</p> <p>Apple and Samsung will also be back in a Californian court in March, in a second trial in which each is asserting five patents &ndash; in Apple's case, all relating to function, not \"how it looks\". Samsung's list includes two standards-essential patents (SEPs) &ndash; which it's obliged to license, so it's hard to see it prevailing on those.</p> <p>Besides those, Rockstar, a company which owns a $4.5bn haul of patents from now-dead Canadian network company Nortel (and is in turn owned by Apple, Microsoft, Ericsson, Sony and BlackBerry), has filed patent infringement cases against Google, Samsung, HTC, Asus, LG, Pantech, Huawei and ZTE &ndash; all Android device makers. In a countersuit, Google says that Rockstar's lawsuit is put \"a cloud on Google's Android platform; threatened Google's business and relationships with its customers and partners, as well as its sales of Nexus-branded devices\".</p> <p>All to play for in that one &ndash; and Rockstar has a cherry on top, which is a separate case against Google where it claims the search company infringes a search patent filed in 1997, before Google even existed. -&nbsp;<strong><em>Charles Arthur</em></strong></p> <h2>Emerging market smartphones</h2> <p>The Chinese market for smartphones has been expanding like a balloon, and it's continuing. Expect 230m handsets to be sold there in 2014, almost all of them \"AOSP\" Android (not running Google services).&nbsp;</p> <p>India too is growing fast &ndash; millions of people there will be getting their first smartphone in 2014, and that could change the complexion not only of the mobile market, but also the country itself. One of the strongest phone brands in India? Nokia. Is this going to be Microsoft's chance?</p> <p>And South America is being targeted by handset makers interested in getting Firefox OS into peoples' hands. There's everything to play for as huge numbers of people get their first internet connection.<em><strong>&nbsp;- Charles Arthur</strong></em></p> <h2>Wearables</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d15f0b39-f39e-46c7-a026-b53f7f809ef0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/3/1386076003861/e8d93298-74da-4581-ac6e-0d635e619198-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nike Fuelband SE\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Fitness trackers or personal nag machines?</figcaption> </figure> <p>With luck, 2014 will be the year that wearables actually become wearable &ndash; rather than being nagging devices that hassle you to take more steps to meet your \"daily exercise quota\". The key problem is crossing the gulf between being \"something you wear\", and \"something you want to be seen wearing\".&nbsp;</p> <p>Google Glass still has dorkiness problems, for all its evident usefulness. All eyes are on Apple to do something there, but it can be the smaller companies that surprise. -&nbsp;<strong><em>Charles Arthur</em></strong></p> <h2>PCs and tablets</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b4b47ba-9d27-48d4-85a3-636b0185be00\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382624961179/480223db-9f8c-45a8-a2b2-6db5f1a19ca1-460x276.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Surface Pro 2 tablet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Microsoft Surface Pro 2 was a full Windows 8.1 computer squeezed into a tablet formfactor and weighed the same as a laptop.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The market for PCs (desktops and fixed-keyboard notebooks) will be flat, at best, but Microsoft &ndash; and computer makers &ndash; have a lot staked on \"convertibles\" with detachable keyboards, and touchscreen laptops.</p> <p>However, there's no sign that people are interested in them. We like our PCs in traditional packages, and all of Microsoft's efforts with the Surface haven't persuaded people that they need one; it's a weight thing. Thinner and lighter always wins on mobile, and even the new generation of Surface isn't thin and light enough to beat other tablets. (And success then comes down to how many apps they can run.)</p> <p>Rumours of a larger Apple tablet - up to 12in? - could mean that the iPad is ready to mature and expand into newer segments. Tablet sales are still rocketing, and even if many are being used as TV replacements (certainly the case in Asia), it's still an opportunity for app developers to get in front of users. -&nbsp;<strong><em>Charles Arthur</em></strong></p> <h2>Cheaper, ever cheaper</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b8834dda-5273-4550-adf3-1e6d1b8f8433\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380818859260/6a071446-dc14-44bb-b1ae-5cfec9a74995-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco Hudl tablet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Tesco's Hudl tablet cost just &pound;119 and flew off the shelves.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The budget tablet market exploded in 2013, filling the void left largely untouched by Apple, Google and other big-brand manufacturers such as Sony and Samsung.

Sometimes, the law catches up with the companies that push their luck, and they are forced to close or comply &ndash; although, all too often, the damage has been done. Napster may have been shut down, but our relationship with paying for music has never quite recovered. Other times, the law is forced to change to accommodate the shifts that technology has made possible. That's why you can now use your Kindle on a plane during take-off and landing.</p> <p>But in recent years, the gap between the cutting edge of technology and the cutting edge of regulation has been getting smaller and smaller, and 2014 could be the first year in which the roles are reversed. For 3D printing, wearable computing and personal drones, legislators are already gearing up to tackle whether &ndash; and how &ndash; the law should react.</p> <p>These technologies haven't yet hit the mainstream, but they have already sparked consternation in the public. 3D-printed guns have already sparked legislation in congress, West Virginia is set to become the first state to ban using Google Glass in a car, and the FAA is committed to reviewing the rules that currently ban companies such as Amazon from using drones to deliver goods. But the biggest fight hasn't even warmed up: that will be the battle around self-driving cars. If you thought it was hard to convince regulators to let you use electronic devices on planes, try to find a regulator who will be happy to have a driver asleep at the wheel. &ndash;&nbsp;<strong><em>Alex Hern</em></strong></p> <h2><strong>Truly smart technologies</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ad672fc7-35fb-4f8c-b40a-20a458848ae0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388656389413/bf5d5aed-a97d-4b98-b90d-9c10915b10b8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Glass tapped by woman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Google Glass could be the future, if it can get over its image and imaging problems.

I'd also like to see some big steps in services that aggregate all, or a lot, of our data for us, and automate the administration of living, whether that's bills or dentist appointments.

Photograph: Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <p>I'm wary about making predictions about bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general. The first time I wrote about them, in March of 2013, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2013/03/bitcoin-what-bubble-looks\">I said that the value of bitcoin looked like a bubble</a>. If, instead of writing the piece, I'd went out and bought &pound;100 of them, I'd currently be sitting on bitcoins worth a little under &pound;2000. The Alex Hern Regrets Index is near an all-time high.</p> <p>But I do, fundamentally, stand by what I wrote back then. The price of a bitcoin looks ever more out of proportion with the number of people using it, and that's a state of affairs that cannot continue. This time last year, the cost of one bitcoin was $13; it is now hovering around $800. And yet, this time last year there were 39,000 bitcoin transactions per day, a number which has barely moved at all, <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=1year&amp;showDataPoints=false&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=\">currently standing at 41,000</a>. People are paying ever more heady sums of money for a currency they are steadfastly not using.</p> <p>But the dying days of 2013 provided a hint as to how this trend will continue into the New Year, with the explosion in value of the \"altcoins\".</p> <p>Because bitcoin is an open-source software project, the programming code at the heart of it is available for anyone to take and use in making their own cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. The first and biggest of these, Litecoin, was created in October 2011, and exploded in value in November 2013, its price shooting up tenfold in a matter of days.</p> <p>The next month saw the creation of <strong>Dogecoin</strong>, an altcoin that had one killer USP: a picture of an adorable Shiba Inu on the front and a website written in multicoloured comic sans and faux broken English. Look, it's the internet; don't try to understand.</p> <p>But the association with <a href=\"http://gawker.com/doge-is-an-actually-good-internet-meme-wow-1460448782\">the popular Doge meme</a> alone was enough to give Dogecoin the cachet required for its own boom and bust. At its peak, around Christmas, when 30m Dogecoins were stolen in a hacking attack on a Dogecoin bank (another new commonplace of cryptocurrencies), the haul was worth around $18,000.</p> <p>So, my prediction for 2014? An extrapolation: the smart money, getting bored of Bitcoin, will start moving on to the various altcoins, chasing the massive profits they can no longer get from bitcoin proper. They'll see their own bubbles of hype and investment, with diminishing returns each time. And by the end of next year, there will still only be a few people actually using bitcoin as a payment mechanism for anything other than illegal and fringe-legal purposes. &ndash;&nbsp;<strong><em>Alex Hern</em></strong></p> <h2>Microsoft, Apple, and Google</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f5637f3b-4ff6-4863-b307-24b5af37eed3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388661445672/ae556473-abfa-4888-8216-01eaf77bd29b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside a Google server farm.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Microsoft, Apple and Google all rely on huge amounts of server power for their globe-spanning services.

Tim Cook's genius at operations shows in how Apple is now making scores of different versions of the iPhone for different markets, yet everyone thinks there's only one (the iPhone for the new China Mobile 4G system, for example, differs from all others sold worldwide).&nbsp;</p> <p>Every new year sees a raft of wild predictions about the unicorns Apple must release or be condemned to obscurity, at least in commentators' eyes. Every year Apple predictably doesn't do them. So what will it do?</p> <p><em>Prediction:</em> it won't release a TV &ndash; the same TV it hasn't released for years. It might update the Apple TV set-top box to do more (add an App Store?), but that's been a \"safely wrong\" prediction for years too.&nbsp;</p> <p>It will probably release a wearable something-or-other; a watch seems most likely. Filing for \"iWatch\" trademarks, as it has in Europe and Japan, is a good sign that something's afoot. Shouldn't there be leaks from the supply chain by now, though?</p> <p>A bigger iPad Air &ndash; iPad Pro? &ndash; looks likely. A touch-based Macbook Air, though, doesn't.</p> <p><strong>Google</strong> is only on its second chief executive (and even he was the original one). It's still a relatively young company, but its rapid growth has seen Larry Page reining in some projects that haven't been core to what Google does &ndash; collect information and collate it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/04/google-plus-the-matrix\">Google+ is core</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/17/google-reader-alternatives\">Google Reader wasn't</a>. And selling adverts is the ultimate core. Quite where Google Glass fits into this isn't yet clear; nor is Motorola, which loses huge amounts of money while selling fewer handsets each quarter.</p> <p>There are also lingering antitrust hassles: besides Europe, where the questions about Google's integration of its vertical search such as shopping and maps into its front page have gone on for three years, Canada has now begun asking exactly the same questions. It's a big inconvenience for Google &ndash; though the bigger headache might be the patent lawsuits referred to above.</p> <p><em>Prediction:</em> Google Glass will go on limited sale, and have limited success; its best use is in narrow commercial applications. Android will continue eating the mobile world, and getting into embedded systems, though frequently without Google services embedded. - <em><strong>Charles Arthur</strong></em></p> <p><em>This article was amended to reflect the fact that the Playable City Award was organised by the Watershed arts venue in Bristol.</em></p>","headline":"Technology predictions for 2014: smarter cities, bigger games","trailText":"From connected cities, drones and patent wars to cheaper tablets, monster games and smart wearables.
