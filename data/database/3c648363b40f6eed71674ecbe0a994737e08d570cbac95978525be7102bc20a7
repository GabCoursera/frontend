A&nbsp;number of other&nbsp;artists have also been in the news, publicly complaining about streaming music services (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/black-keys\" title=\"\">Black Keys</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/29/aimee-mann-review\" title=\"\">Aimee Mann</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidlowry\" title=\"\">David Lowery</a> of Camper van Beethoven and Cracker). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metallica\" title=\"\">Metallica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd\" title=\"\">Pink Floyd</a> were longtime Spotify holdouts – until recently. I've pulled as much of my catalogue from Spotify as I can. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/acdc\" title=\"\">AC/DC</a>, Garth Brooks and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin\" title=\"\">Led Zeppelin</a> have never agreed to be on these services in the first place.</p><p>So, what's the deal? What are these services, what do they do and why are&nbsp;these musicians complaining?</p><p>There are a number of ways to stream music online: Pandora is like a radio station that plays stuff you like but doesn't take requests; YouTube plays individual songs that folks and corporations have uploaded and Spotify is a music library that plays whatever you want (if they have it), whenever you want it. Some of these services only work when you're online, but some, like Spotify, allow you to download your playlist songs and carry&nbsp;them around. For many music listeners, the choice is obvious – why would you ever buy a CD or pay for a download when you can stream your favourite albums and artists either for free, or for a nominal monthly charge?</p><p>Not surprisingly, streaming looks to be the future of music consumption – it&nbsp;already is the future in Scandinavia, where Spotify (the largest streaming service) started, and in Spain. Other countries are following close behind. Spotify is the second largest source of&nbsp;digital music revenue for labels in Europe, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Significantly, that's income for labels, not artists. There are&nbsp;other streaming services, too – Deezer, Google Play, Apple and Jimmy Iovine of Interscope has one coming called Daisy – though my guess is that, as with most web-based businesses, only one will be left standing in the end. There aren't two Facebooks or Amazons. Domination and monopoly is the name of the game in the web&nbsp;marketplace.</p><p>The amounts these services pay per stream is miniscule – their idea being that if enough people use the service those tiny grains of sand will pile up. Domination and ubiquity are therefore to be encouraged. We should readjust our values because in the web-based world we are told that monopoly is good for us. The major record labels usually siphon off most of this income, and then they dribble about 15-20% of what's left down to their artists. Indie labels are often a lot fairer – sometimes sharing the income 50/50. Damon Krukowski (Galaxie 500, Damon &amp; Naomi) <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8993-the-cloud/\" title=\"\">has published abysmal data on payouts</a> from Pandora and Spotify for his song \"Tugboat\" and Lowery even wrote a piece entitled \"<a href=\"http://thetrichordist.com/2013/06/24/my-song-got-played-on-pandora-1-million-times-and-all-i-got-was-16-89-less-than-what-i-make-from-a-single-t-shirt-sale/\" title=\"\">My Song Got Played on Pandora 1 Million Times and All I Got Was $16.89, Less Than What I Make from a Single T-shirt&nbsp;Sale!</a>\" For a&nbsp;band of four people that makes a 15% royalty from Spotify streams, <a href=\"http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/\" title=\"\">it would take 236,549,020 streams for each person to earn a minimum wage of $15,080 (£9,435) a year</a>. For perspective, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk\" title=\"\">Daft Punk</a>'s song of the summer, \"Get Lucky\", reached 104,760,000 Spotify streams by the end of August: the two&nbsp;Daft Punk guys stand to make somewhere around $13,000 each. Not bad, but remember this is just one song from a lengthy recording that took a lot of time and money to develop. That won't pay their bills if it's their principal source of income. And what happens to the bands who don't have massive international summer hits?</p><p>In future, if artists have to rely almost exclusively on the income from these services, they'll be out of work within a year. Some of us have other sources of income, such as live concerts, and some of us have reached the point where we can play to decent numbers of people because a record label believed in us at some point in the&nbsp;past. I can't deny that label-support gave me a leg up – though not every successful artist needs it. So, yes, I could conceivably survive, as I don't rely on the pittance that comes my way from music streaming, as could Yorke and some of the others. But up-and-coming artists don't have that advantage – some haven't got to the point where they can make a living on live performances and licensing, so what do they think of these services?</p><p>Some artists and indie musicians see Spotify fairly positively – as a way of getting noticed, of getting your music out there where folks can hear it risk free. Daniel Glass, of Glassnote records, who have the very popular band <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mumford-and-sons\" title=\"\">Mumford &amp; Sons</a> says:&nbsp;\"When you have quality and you're in the sophomore stage of this band's career, I think the fear of holding it back is worse than letting it go.&nbsp;Opening up the faucet and letting people hear it, stream it and all that stuff is definitely very healthy.\" Cellist Zoë Keating sees it similarly: Spotify is \"awesome as a listening platform. In my opinion artists should view it as a discovery service rather than a source of&nbsp;income.\"&nbsp;</p><p>I can understand how having a&nbsp;place where people can listen to your work when they are told or read about it is helpful, but surely a lot of places already do that? I manage to check stuff out without using these services. I'll go directly to&nbsp;an artist's website, or Bandcamp, or even Amazon – and then, if I like what I hear, there is often the option to buy. Zoë also seems to assume there will be other sources of income (from recorded music). If these services fulfil their mandate, there won't be.</p><p>I also don't understand the claim of&nbsp;discovery that Spotify makes; the actual moment of discovery in most cases happens at the moment when someone else tells you about an artist or you read about them – not when you're on the streaming service listening to what you have read about (though Spotify does indeed have a \"discovery\" page that, like Pandora's algorithm, suggests artists you might like). There is also, I'm told, a way to see what your \"friends\" have on their playlists, though I'd be curious to know&nbsp;whether a significant number of&nbsp;people find new music in this way. I'd be even more curious if the folks who \"discover\" music on these services then go on to purchase it. Why would you click and go elsewhere and pay when the free version is sitting right in front of you? Am I crazy?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419724666'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/10/1381397946340/Aimee-Mann-performs-at-th-009.jpg' alt='Aimee Mann performs at the Royal Festival Hall, London, Britain - 28 Jan 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Speaking out … Aimee Mann. Photograph: Jeff Barclay/Music Pics/Rex Fe</figcaption></figure><p>Artists often find this discovery argument seductive, but only up to a&nbsp;point. Patrick Carney of Black Keys said in 2011: \"For unknown bands and smaller bands, it's a really good thing to get yourself out there. But for a band that makes a living selling music,\" streaming royalties are \"not at a point yet to be feasible for us\". How do you make the transition from \"I'll give away anything to get noticed\" to \"Sorry, now you have to pay for my music\"? Carney's implied point is important – the core issue is about sustainability; how can artists survive in the long term beyond that initial surge of interest?</p><p>Are these services evil? Are they simply a legalised version of file-sharing sites such as Napster and Pirate&nbsp;Bay – with the difference being that with streaming services the big labels now get hefty advances?  The debate as to whether those pirate sites&nbsp;cannibalise possible sales goes on.&nbsp;Some say freeloaders wouldn't have paid for music anyway, so there's no real loss; others say freeloaders are mainly super-fans who end up paying artists in other ways, buying concert tickets and T-shirts, for example. Though, as author Chris Ruen points out in his book <em>Freeloading</em>, if you yourself didn't pay for any of the music by your favourite bands, then don't be surprised if they eventually call it quits for lack of funds.</p><p>Musicians are increasingly suspicious of the money and equity changing hands between these services and record labels – both money and equity has been exchanged based on content and assets that artists produced but seem to have no say over. Spotify gave $500m in advances to major labels in the US for the right to license their catalogues. That was an \"advance\" against income – so theoretically it's&nbsp;not&nbsp;the labels' money to pocket. Another chunk of change is soon to follow. The labels also got equity; so they are now partners and shareholders in Spotify, which is valued at around $3bn. That income from equity, when and if the service goes public, does not have to be shared with the artists. It seems obvious that some people are making a&nbsp;lot of money on this deal, while the artists have been left with meagre scraps.</p><p>The major labels are happy, the consumer is happy and the CEOs of the&nbsp;web services are happy. All good, except no one is left to speak for those who actually make the stuff. In response to this lack of representation, some artists – of all types, not just musicians – are forming an organisation called the <a href=\"http://contentcreatorscoalition.org/\" title=\"\">Content Creators Coalition</a>, an entity that speaks out on artists' behalf.</p><p>Is there a fair solution? And does it matter? Historically, musicians who weren't among the top pop stars were never well-paid – isn't that just the way it goes if you decide to make music your calling? Like writers and fine artists, most of them will never make a&nbsp;living doing exclusively what they love doing? Is this griping equivalent to Metallica's complaint about Napster – viewed by many as the moaning of a&nbsp;bunch of fat cats who were out of touch? Were recording artists simply spoiled for a few decades and now those days are gone? Even Wagner was&nbsp;always in debt and slept with rich women to get funding – so nothing's new, right? I know quite a few fine artists who teach – presumably to make&nbsp;ends meet and to allow them the&nbsp;freedom to do what they want. But&nbsp;I don't see hordes of band-members getting comfy spots in&nbsp;universities anytime soon.</p><p>The larger question is that if free or&nbsp;cheap streaming becomes the way we consume all (recorded) music and indeed a huge percentage of other creative content – TV, movies, games, art, porn – then perhaps we might stop&nbsp;for a moment and consider the&nbsp;effect these services and this technology will&nbsp;have, before \"selling off\" all our cultural assets the way the&nbsp;big record companies did. If, for instance, the future of the movie business comes to&nbsp;rely on the income from Netflix's $8-a-month-streaming-service as a way to fund all films and TV production, then things will change very quickly. As with music, that model doesn't seem sustainable if&nbsp;it becomes the dominant form of consumption. Musicians might, for now, challenge the major labels and get&nbsp;a fairer deal than 15% of a pittance, but it seems to me that the whole model is unsustainable as a means of supporting creative work of any kind. Not just music. The inevitable result would seem to be that the internet will&nbsp;suck the creative content out of the whole world until nothing is left. Writers, for example, can't rely on making money from live performances – what are they supposed to do? Write&nbsp;ad copy?</p><p>As Lowery has pointed out, there's no reason artists should simply accept the terms and join up with whatever new technology comes along. Now I'm starting to sound like a real Luddite, but taking a minute to think about the consequences before diving in seems like a pretty good idea in general. You shouldn't have to give up your privacy, or allow all sorts of information about yourself to be used, whenever you go online, for example.</p><p>I don't have an answer. I wish I could propose something besides what we've heard before: \"Make money on live shows.\" Or, \"Get corporate support and sell your music to advertisers.\"</p><p>What's at stake is not so much the survival of artists like me, but that of&nbsp;emerging artists and those who have&nbsp;only a few records under their belts (such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/st-vincent\" title=\"\">St Vincent</a>, my current touring partner, who is not exactly an unknown). Many musicians like her, who seem to be well established, well&nbsp;known and very talented, will eventually have to find employment elsewhere or change what they do to make more money. Without new&nbsp;artists coming up, our future as&nbsp;a&nbsp;musical culture looks grim. A&nbsp;culture&nbsp;of blockbusters is sad, and ultimately it's bad for business. That's not the world that inspired me when I&nbsp;was younger. Many a fan (myself included) has said that \"music saved my life\", so there must be some incentive to keep that lifesaver available for future generations.</p>","headline":"David Byrne: 'The internet will suck all creative content out of the world'","trailText":"<p>The boom in digital streaming may generate profits for record labels and free content for consumers, but it spells disaster for today's artists, says<strong> David Byrne</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/9/1381321383753/David-Byrne-005.jpg","wordcount":"2095","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-18T12:13:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world","tags":[{"id":"music/david-byrne","webTitle":"David Byrne","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/david-byrne","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/david-byrne","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"technology/digital-music-and-audio","webTitle":"Digital music and audio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/digital-music-and-audio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/digital-music-and-audio","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/spotify","webTitle":"Spotify","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/spotify","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"profile/david-byrne-contributor","webTitle":"David Byrne","r2ContributorId":"58963","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380822981368/David-Byrne140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Byrne is an artist and musician.

The deal was announced as part of a major expansion for the music service, which now offers a free version of its service on mobile and tablet as well as desktop, and has launched in 20 new countries including Peru, Chile and even Malta in its battle to reach a more mainstream audience.</p> <p>Announcing the new \"shuffle play\" service in New York on Wednesday, Spotify said the new feature for its mobile apps will allow users to stream songs for free supported by adverts in a similar manner to its desktop service. Users can choose any artist on Spotify to hear their entire catalogue in shuffle mode, and they can also select a personal playlist or one curated by Spotify editors and the community.</p> <p>Unlike competing &ldquo;radio&rdquo; products, Spotify users can shuffle the entire back catalogue of a particular artist. Paying subscribers already get an advert-free version, but this extends the service to mobile - an increasingly popular way of accessing music online.</p> <p>Spotify founder Daniel Ek confirmed the service will give users access to the entire 20m-strong Spotify catalogue for free using playlists. \"Nearly half of mobile listening, if not more, is people listening to their own curated playlists,\" said Ek. \"With shuffle play, you can now play any of your playlists for free. Spotify's new mobile experience is music for anyone and the best experience and access in the history of music.&rdquo;</p> <p>Nearly 45 years after Led Zeppelin released their eponymous debut album, the band's entire Swan Song/Atlantic catalogue will be released in the next few days. Spotify has been courting established artists for some time, with Metallica&rsquo;s Lars Ulrich famously buddying up with Spotify investor Sean Parker on-stage at the announcement of his band&rsquo;s exclusive deal in December 2012.</p> <p>The pair had been at loggerheads in the days when Parker was co-founder of the original Napster filesharing service. Since Metallica added its back catalogue to Spotify, the band&rsquo;s most popular track, Nothing Else Matters, streamed more than 9.1m times, while Enter Sandman has notched up 9m streams.</p> <p>&ldquo;What does it say about the age of music subscribers?\" said Mark Mulligan, co-founder of media industry consulting firm MIDiA. \"Aging rockers like Metallica and now Led Zeppelin show Spotify is courting older users, those which aren&rsquo;t necessarily early adopters and therefore aren&rsquo;t streaming users.\"</p> <p>Mulligan said that exclusives like this, where one artist or band only releases their music on one streaming service, were likely a short-term strategy, as it would be in their best interest to ensure their music can be streamed by as many fans as possible on different services.</p> <p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re likely to see is a move to time-release window exclusivities, where an album or track is available for a week in one place before general availability. Something Daft Punk recently saw success with an iTunes week-long exclusive,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>Spotify already faces competition from other mobile personal-radio services, including Last.fm and Blinkbox in the UK, as well as Pandora in the US. The latter has 72.4m active users, with 80% of its listening happening in mobile and connected devices. Apple&rsquo;s iTunes Radio, which attracted 20m users in its first month in the US, is also in this space, while Spotify&rsquo;s direct rivals Deezer, Rdio and the UK-only Bloom.fm also blend free personal radio with full &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; access for paying subscribers.</p> <p>The Swedish company hopes its free personal radio on mobile will act as a gateway to its premium subscription service, although it could also spark new criticism from musicians, who receive smaller payouts for streams of their songs by free users than by paying subscribers.</p> <p>Spotify recently released numbers and analysis of plays, showing that a single play of a track would earn rightsholders between $0.006 and $0.0084, although this was averaging out free and paid streams.</p> <p>Spotify says it has paid $500m to music industry rightsholders in 2013, and more than $1bn in total since its launch in 2008. However, criticism of its business model has been led by musicians like Thom Yorke, who has attacked the business models of digital music services for trying to be gatekeepers for music, and in October dismissed Spotify as the \"last desperate fart of a dying corpse\".</p>","headline":"Led Zeppelin comes to Spotify along with free music streaming for mobiles","trailText":"In a bid for a mainstream audience, the music streaming service now offers free music on mobile, tablet and desktop and is expanding to 20 new countries.

Released this week, the lists feature some predictable and not-so-predictable outcomes: Avicii, Daft Punk, Robin Thicke, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis triumphed, the latter becoming the most-streamed act of the year worldwide on Spotify for both singles and albums and accumulating 34m Shazam taggings globally. British singer Bastille fared well in both the album and singles charts, alongside OneRepublic and Imagine Dragons, who flew the flag for glossy, epic alt-pop. Interestingly, aside from Rihanna and this year's breakout artist Lorde, female pop stars such as Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga didn't appear as much as you might imagine. </p><p>Take a look at the track lists below and let us know what you think.

I feel that in some ways what's happening in the mainstream is the last gasp of the old industry. Once that does finally die, which it will, something else will happen,\" Yorke told Sopitas.</p><p>\"But it's all about how we change the way we listen to music, it's all about what happens next in terms of technology, in terms of how people talk to each other about music, and a lot of it could be really fucking bad.\"</p><p>The interview follows Atoms for Peace's decision earlier this year to pull its albums from Spotify and other streaming services, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/thom-yorke-spotify-twitter\">Yorke and bandmate Nigel Godrich sparking a heated debate</a> with their tweeted views on Spotify being bad for emerging artists.</p><p>The new interview is Yorke's longest yet explaining his views, as he compares Spotify to what Radiohead did with their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/07/musicnews.music\">In Rainbows album in 2007</a>, self-releasing it online and allowing fans to set their own price for the download.</p><p>\"When we did the In Rainbows thing what was most exciting was the idea you could have a direct connection between you as a musician and your audience. You cut all of it out, it's just that and that. And then all these fuckers get in a way, like Spotify suddenly trying to become the gatekeepers to the whole process,\" said Yorke.</p><p>\"We don't need you to do it. No artists needs you to do it. We can build the shit ourselves, so fuck off. But because they're using old music, because they're using the majors… the majors are all over it because they see a way of re-selling all their old stuff for free, make a fortune, and not die.\"</p><p>Spotify has become a lightning rod for criticism of streaming music by artists in recent months, partly because it's the biggest service of its kind, with more than 24m active users and 6m paying subscribers.</p><p>The company has defended itself by pointing to the money it has paid out to music rightsholders – $500m by the end of 2012, with another $500m expected this year. And while that doesn't answer Yorke's specific criticism about major labels, Spotify has been praised by companies in the independent music world too.</p><p>In January, Beggars Group chairman Martin Mills said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/04/record-labels-making-money-youtube\">22% of his label group's digital revenues had come from streaming</a> in 2012. Meanwhile, independent labels' trade body Merlin – which like the major labels has a stake in Spotify – said in May that <a href=\"http://www.merlinnetwork.org/membersurvey/\">a third of its members had seen streaming revenues more than double</a> in the last year.</p><p>Spotify has also been hailed as a key factor in the music industry's comeback in countries like <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/21/swedish-music-sales-up-12-in-first-half-of-2013/\">Sweden</a> and <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/11/streaming-still-storming-as-norwegian-music-sales-rise-17-year-on-year/\">Norway</a>, where recorded music revenues rose 12% and 17% respectively in the first half of 2013, following more growth in 2012 after a decade of declining music sales.</p><p>Thom Yorke remains unconvinced that streaming is the answer to artists' problems, though. \"To me this isn't the mainstream, this is is like the last fart, the last desperate fart of a dying corpse. What happens next is the important part,\" he told Sopitas, before suggesting that the music industry should rethink its backing for certain new business models.</p><p>\"It's like this mind trick going on, people are like 'with technology, it's all going to become one in the cloud and all creativity is going to become one thing and no one is going to get paid and it's this big super intelligent thing'.

and David Byrne have criticised Spotify and rival streaming music services for the size of their payouts to musician. Billy Bragg thinks the attention should be more on labels.</p> <p>\"The problem with the business model for streaming is that most artists still have contracts from the analog age, when record companies did all the heavy lifting of physical production and distribution, so only paid artists 8%-15% royalties on average,\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/billybraggofficial/posts/10151678036227471\">wrote Bragg in a post on his Facebook page</a>.</p> <p>\"Those rates, carried over to the digital age, explain why artists are getting such paltry sums from Spotify. If the rates were really so bad, the rights holders - the major record companies - would be complaining. The fact that they're continuing to sign up means they must be making good money.\"</p> <p>Spotify pays out 70% of its revenues to music rightsholders, and has said that it expects those payments to exceed $500m (&pound;310m) in 2013. How much of that money gets passed on to musicians depends on the terms of their contracts with labels.</p> <p>Not every label is paying artists a mere 8%-15% of royalties from streams of their music. Beggars Group, the parent company of labels counting Adele, Vampire Weekend, Sigur R&oacute;s and Yorke's Atoms for Peace on their rosters, has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/04/record-labels-making-money-youtube\">policy of paying artists 50% of their streaming revenues</a>.</p> <p>Bragg posted his comments from Sweden during his current tour, and cited news that some Swedish artists are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/25/spotify-artists-sue-labels-music-streaming\">threatening to sue major labels Universal Music And Warner Music</a> over streaming royalties as potential inspiration for British musicians.</p> <p>\"Artists have identified that the problem lies with the major record labels rather the streaming service and are taking action to get royalty rates that better reflect the costs involved in digital production and distribution. UK artists would be smart to follow suit,\" wrote Bragg.</p> <p>He also suggested that artists are wasting their energies criticising Spotify and other streaming services.&nbsp;\"I've long felt that artists railing against Spotify is about as helpful to their cause as campaigning against the Sony Walkman would have been in the early 80s,\" wrote Bragg.</p> <p>\"Music fans are increasingly streaming their music and, as artists, we have to adapt ourselves to their behaviour, rather than try to hold the line on a particular mode of listening to music.\"</p> <p>In October, Thom Yorke described Spotify as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\">\"the last desperate fart of a dying corpse\"</a> in an interview with a Mexican website, claiming that \"as musicians we need to fight the Spotify thing... it's all&nbsp;about how we change the way we listen to music, it's all about what happens next in terms of technology, in terms of how people talk to each other about music, and a lot of it could be really fucking bad.\"</p> <p>His criticism was followed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world\">an opinion piece by David Byrne for The Guardian</a> in which he praised some elements of Spotify, but warned that while labels have equity stakes in the company, artists may lose out from the growth of streaming services.</p> <p>\"It seems to me that the whole model is unsustainable as a means of supporting creative work of any kind. Not just music.

A&nbsp;number of other&nbsp;artists have also been in the news, publicly complaining about streaming music services (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/black-keys\" title=\"\">Black Keys</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/29/aimee-mann-review\" title=\"\">Aimee Mann</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidlowry\" title=\"\">David Lowery</a> of Camper van Beethoven and Cracker). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metallica\" title=\"\">Metallica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd\" title=\"\">Pink Floyd</a> were longtime Spotify holdouts – until recently. I've pulled as much of my catalogue from Spotify as I can. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/acdc\" title=\"\">AC/DC</a>, Garth Brooks and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin\" title=\"\">Led Zeppelin</a> have never agreed to be on these services in the first place.</p><p>So, what's the deal? What are these services, what do they do and why are&nbsp;these musicians complaining?</p><p>There are a number of ways to stream music online: Pandora is like a radio station that plays stuff you like but doesn't take requests; YouTube plays individual songs that folks and corporations have uploaded and Spotify is a music library that plays whatever you want (if they have it), whenever you want it. Some of these services only work when you're online, but some, like Spotify, allow you to download your playlist songs and carry&nbsp;them around. For many music listeners, the choice is obvious – why would you ever buy a CD or pay for a download when you can stream your favourite albums and artists either for free, or for a nominal monthly charge?</p><p>Not surprisingly, streaming looks to be the future of music consumption – it&nbsp;already is the future in Scandinavia, where Spotify (the largest streaming service) started, and in Spain. Other countries are following close behind. Spotify is the second largest source of&nbsp;digital music revenue for labels in Europe, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Significantly, that's income for labels, not artists. There are&nbsp;other streaming services, too – Deezer, Google Play, Apple and Jimmy Iovine of Interscope has one coming called Daisy – though my guess is that, as with most web-based businesses, only one will be left standing in the end. There aren't two Facebooks or Amazons. Domination and monopoly is the name of the game in the web&nbsp;marketplace.</p><p>The amounts these services pay per stream is miniscule – their idea being that if enough people use the service those tiny grains of sand will pile up. Domination and ubiquity are therefore to be encouraged. We should readjust our values because in the web-based world we are told that monopoly is good for us. The major record labels usually siphon off most of this income, and then they dribble about 15-20% of what's left down to their artists. Indie labels are often a lot fairer – sometimes sharing the income 50/50. Damon Krukowski (Galaxie 500, Damon &amp; Naomi) <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8993-the-cloud/\" title=\"\">has published abysmal data on payouts</a> from Pandora and Spotify for his song \"Tugboat\" and Lowery even wrote a piece entitled \"<a href=\"http://thetrichordist.com/2013/06/24/my-song-got-played-on-pandora-1-million-times-and-all-i-got-was-16-89-less-than-what-i-make-from-a-single-t-shirt-sale/\" title=\"\">My Song Got Played on Pandora 1 Million Times and All I Got Was $16.89, Less Than What I Make from a Single T-shirt&nbsp;Sale!</a>\" For a&nbsp;band of four people that makes a 15% royalty from Spotify streams, <a href=\"http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/\" title=\"\">it would take 236,549,020 streams for each person to earn a minimum wage of $15,080 (£9,435) a year</a>. For perspective, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk\" title=\"\">Daft Punk</a>'s song of the summer, \"Get Lucky\", reached 104,760,000 Spotify streams by the end of August: the two&nbsp;Daft Punk guys stand to make somewhere around $13,000 each. Not bad, but remember this is just one song from a lengthy recording that took a lot of time and money to develop. That won't pay their bills if it's their principal source of income. And what happens to the bands who don't have massive international summer hits?</p><p>In future, if artists have to rely almost exclusively on the income from these services, they'll be out of work within a year. Some of us have other sources of income, such as live concerts, and some of us have reached the point where we can play to decent numbers of people because a record label believed in us at some point in the&nbsp;past. I can't deny that label-support gave me a leg up – though not every successful artist needs it. So, yes, I could conceivably survive, as I don't rely on the pittance that comes my way from music streaming, as could Yorke and some of the others. But up-and-coming artists don't have that advantage – some haven't got to the point where they can make a living on live performances and licensing, so what do they think of these services?</p><p>Some artists and indie musicians see Spotify fairly positively – as a way of getting noticed, of getting your music out there where folks can hear it risk free. Daniel Glass, of Glassnote records, who have the very popular band <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mumford-and-sons\" title=\"\">Mumford &amp; Sons</a> says:&nbsp;\"When you have quality and you're in the sophomore stage of this band's career, I think the fear of holding it back is worse than letting it go.&nbsp;Opening up the faucet and letting people hear it, stream it and all that stuff is definitely very healthy.\" Cellist Zoë Keating sees it similarly: Spotify is \"awesome as a listening platform. In my opinion artists should view it as a discovery service rather than a source of&nbsp;income.\"&nbsp;</p><p>I can understand how having a&nbsp;place where people can listen to your work when they are told or read about it is helpful, but surely a lot of places already do that? I manage to check stuff out without using these services. I'll go directly to&nbsp;an artist's website, or Bandcamp, or even Amazon – and then, if I like what I hear, there is often the option to buy. Zoë also seems to assume there will be other sources of income (from recorded music). If these services fulfil their mandate, there won't be.</p><p>I also don't understand the claim of&nbsp;discovery that Spotify makes; the actual moment of discovery in most cases happens at the moment when someone else tells you about an artist or you read about them – not when you're on the streaming service listening to what you have read about (though Spotify does indeed have a \"discovery\" page that, like Pandora's algorithm, suggests artists you might like). There is also, I'm told, a way to see what your \"friends\" have on their playlists, though I'd be curious to know&nbsp;whether a significant number of&nbsp;people find new music in this way. I'd be even more curious if the folks who \"discover\" music on these services then go on to purchase it. Why would you click and go elsewhere and pay when the free version is sitting right in front of you? Am I crazy?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419724666'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/10/1381397946340/Aimee-Mann-performs-at-th-009.jpg' alt='Aimee Mann performs at the Royal Festival Hall, London, Britain - 28 Jan 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Speaking out … Aimee Mann. Photograph: Jeff Barclay/Music Pics/Rex Fe</figcaption></figure><p>Artists often find this discovery argument seductive, but only up to a&nbsp;point. Patrick Carney of Black Keys said in 2011: \"For unknown bands and smaller bands, it's a really good thing to get yourself out there. But for a band that makes a living selling music,\" streaming royalties are \"not at a point yet to be feasible for us\". How do you make the transition from \"I'll give away anything to get noticed\" to \"Sorry, now you have to pay for my music\"? Carney's implied point is important – the core issue is about sustainability; how can artists survive in the long term beyond that initial surge of interest?</p><p>Are these services evil? Are they simply a legalised version of file-sharing sites such as Napster and Pirate&nbsp;Bay – with the difference being that with streaming services the big labels now get hefty advances?  The debate as to whether those pirate sites&nbsp;cannibalise possible sales goes on.&nbsp;Some say freeloaders wouldn't have paid for music anyway, so there's no real loss; others say freeloaders are mainly super-fans who end up paying artists in other ways, buying concert tickets and T-shirts, for example. Though, as author Chris Ruen points out in his book <em>Freeloading</em>, if you yourself didn't pay for any of the music by your favourite bands, then don't be surprised if they eventually call it quits for lack of funds.</p><p>Musicians are increasingly suspicious of the money and equity changing hands between these services and record labels – both money and equity has been exchanged based on content and assets that artists produced but seem to have no say over. Spotify gave $500m in advances to major labels in the US for the right to license their catalogues. That was an \"advance\" against income – so theoretically it's&nbsp;not&nbsp;the labels' money to pocket. Another chunk of change is soon to follow. The labels also got equity; so they are now partners and shareholders in Spotify, which is valued at around $3bn. That income from equity, when and if the service goes public, does not have to be shared with the artists. It seems obvious that some people are making a&nbsp;lot of money on this deal, while the artists have been left with meagre scraps.</p><p>The major labels are happy, the consumer is happy and the CEOs of the&nbsp;web services are happy. All good, except no one is left to speak for those who actually make the stuff. In response to this lack of representation, some artists – of all types, not just musicians – are forming an organisation called the <a href=\"http://contentcreatorscoalition.org/\" title=\"\">Content Creators Coalition</a>, an entity that speaks out on artists' behalf.</p><p>Is there a fair solution? And does it matter? Historically, musicians who weren't among the top pop stars were never well-paid – isn't that just the way it goes if you decide to make music your calling? Like writers and fine artists, most of them will never make a&nbsp;living doing exclusively what they love doing? Is this griping equivalent to Metallica's complaint about Napster – viewed by many as the moaning of a&nbsp;bunch of fat cats who were out of touch? Were recording artists simply spoiled for a few decades and now those days are gone? Even Wagner was&nbsp;always in debt and slept with rich women to get funding – so nothing's new, right? I know quite a few fine artists who teach – presumably to make&nbsp;ends meet and to allow them the&nbsp;freedom to do what they want. But&nbsp;I don't see hordes of band-members getting comfy spots in&nbsp;universities anytime soon.</p><p>The larger question is that if free or&nbsp;cheap streaming becomes the way we consume all (recorded) music and indeed a huge percentage of other creative content – TV, movies, games, art, porn – then perhaps we might stop&nbsp;for a moment and consider the&nbsp;effect these services and this technology will&nbsp;have, before \"selling off\" all our cultural assets the way the&nbsp;big record companies did. If, for instance, the future of the movie business comes to&nbsp;rely on the income from Netflix's $8-a-month-streaming-service as a way to fund all films and TV production, then things will change very quickly. As with music, that model doesn't seem sustainable if&nbsp;it becomes the dominant form of consumption. Musicians might, for now, challenge the major labels and get&nbsp;a fairer deal than 15% of a pittance, but it seems to me that the whole model is unsustainable as a means of supporting creative work of any kind. Not just music. The inevitable result would seem to be that the internet will&nbsp;suck the creative content out of the whole world until nothing is left. Writers, for example, can't rely on making money from live performances – what are they supposed to do? Write&nbsp;ad copy?</p><p>As Lowery has pointed out, there's no reason artists should simply accept the terms and join up with whatever new technology comes along. Now I'm starting to sound like a real Luddite, but taking a minute to think about the consequences before diving in seems like a pretty good idea in general. You shouldn't have to give up your privacy, or allow all sorts of information about yourself to be used, whenever you go online, for example.</p><p>I don't have an answer. I wish I could propose something besides what we've heard before: \"Make money on live shows.\" Or, \"Get corporate support and sell your music to advertisers.\"</p><p>What's at stake is not so much the survival of artists like me, but that of&nbsp;emerging artists and those who have&nbsp;only a few records under their belts (such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/st-vincent\" title=\"\">St Vincent</a>, my current touring partner, who is not exactly an unknown). Many musicians like her, who seem to be well established, well&nbsp;known and very talented, will eventually have to find employment elsewhere or change what they do to make more money. Without new&nbsp;artists coming up, our future as&nbsp;a&nbsp;musical culture looks grim. A&nbsp;culture&nbsp;of blockbusters is sad, and ultimately it's bad for business. That's not the world that inspired me when I&nbsp;was younger. Many a fan (myself included) has said that \"music saved my life\", so there must be some incentive to keep that lifesaver available for future generations.</p>","headline":"David Byrne: 'The internet will suck all creative content out of the world'","trailText":"<p>The boom in digital streaming may generate profits for record labels and free content for consumers, but it spells disaster for today's artists, says<strong> David Byrne</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/9/1381321383753/David-Byrne-005.jpg","wordcount":"2095","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-10-18T12:13:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world","tags":[{"id":"music/david-byrne","webTitle":"David Byrne","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/david-byrne","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/david-byrne","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"technology/digital-music-and-audio","webTitle":"Digital music and audio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/digital-music-and-audio","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/digital-music-and-audio","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/spotify","webTitle":"Spotify","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/spotify","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"profile/david-byrne-contributor","webTitle":"David Byrne","r2ContributorId":"58963","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380822981368/David-Byrne140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Byrne is an artist and musician.
