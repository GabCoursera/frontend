At least someone at the  stadium displayed a sense of humour.</p><p>This was an awful League Cup final, hallmarked by the fear of losing rather than anything tactically positive. Not that Aberdeen will care; the Pittodrie club's 19-year wait for a trophy has ended, courtesy of this 4-2 penalty shootout win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle.</p><p>How Aberdeen enjoyed their celebrations, as they were fully entitled to after year upon year of abject failure in cup competitions. They won this trophy without conceding a single goal in the tournament.</p><p>Earlier, it looked as if Aberdeen might again wilt under the weight of expectation. They had 40,000 supporters here, thereby dwarfing the visiting contingent of only 7,000, but fans do not win matches; Aberdeen's status in Scottish football has been contradicted by recent underachievement.</p><p>\"Whether we won by four or five goals, playing sparkling football, or we won the way we eventually did it; I said beforehand that it was all about winning,\" said the Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes. To be fair, McInnes had been hampered by the absence of Peter Pawlett through injury. Aberdeen's creative presence was further restricted as Jonny Hayes departed the final scene with a damaged shoulder, only five minutes into the match.</p><p>Those problems should have been offset by the award of a 35th-minute penalty after Adam Rooney was fouled by Josh Meekings. John Hughes, the Inverness manager, cited a \"stonewall\" claim of his own during the second half after Richie Foran toppled under an Andrew Considine challenge. Foran later concurred. \"I'll be expecting a call from the referee through the week to apologise,\" said the Inverness captain.</p><p>The only clear-cut opportunity of regulation time fell to Niall McGinn, who blazed wildly over after capitalising on a mix-up in the Inverness defence. Extra time was similarly lacking in incident, save free-kicks for both teams in the dying moments which were both, fittingly, lashed over the crossbar.</p><p>Inverness missed their first two kicks of the shootout, thereby giving Aberdeen impetus they never looked like giving up. Rooney, a former Inverness player, scored the decisive penalty.</p><p>\"We have tasted success now and it's important we have that success again,\" added McInnes. \"This is a special day.\"</p><p>Indeed it was; if the culmination of an instantly forgettable game.</p><p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Russell Anderson (Aberdeen)</p>","headline":"Aberdeen lift Scottish League Cup by beating Inverness CT on penalties","trailText":"Aberdeen ended a 19-year wait for silverware by winning a penalty shootout 4-2 against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the final of the Scottish League Cup","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/3/16/1394995438744/Aberdeen-celebrate-winnin-006.jpg","wordcount":"390","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-19T18:39:48Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/aberdeen-inverness-scottish-league-cup-final-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/16/aberdeen-inverness-scottish-league-cup-final-report","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/aberdeen","webTitle":"Aberdeen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/aberdeen","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/93"}]},{"id":"football/invernesscaledonianthistle","webTitle":"Inverness Caledonian Thistle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/invernesscaledonianthistle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/invernesscaledonianthistle","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1456"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

When Derek McInnes left St Johnstone for Bristol City in October 2011, he was viewed as a hot managerial prospect. At that point Owen Coyle's star was still shining brightly in England; he had preceded McInnes at St Johnstone.</p><p>Subsequent events and struggles at Ashton Gate have vindicated McInnes, but when he left Bristol in January 2013, he looked like merely another Scottish coach who had toiled in the graveyard that is the Championship. Plenty  from north of the border had done likewise, with David Moyes a notable exception.</p><p>\"We kept them up from an impossible situation and in a 15-month period I felt that 12 months of that we were all right,\" McInnes explains. \"The club had flirted with relegation for a few seasons and I know the belief from some people there was that they probably had to go down. It was a really mismanaged club. There were four different managers' signings in the one dressing room and it needed to sort itself out.</p><p>\"It shows you how quickly things can change. I felt I had the confidence of everybody I worked for down south. Obviously, that changed quickly and ended with me losing my job.\"</p><p>On Sunday, as he leads Aberdeen out for their first cup final appearance in 14 years, it will only be natural for McInnes to relish the opportunity to settle a Bristol score. \"There's an element of you where you think why do you want to be successful?\" McInnes says. \"Why do you want to be a winner? Why do you want to win trophies?</p><p>\"There's always go to be some sort of motivation and you are always trying to prove people wrong, rather than trying to prove other people right. Because the people who love you, your family and the rest, they are there for you anyway whether you win games or lose games. It's always nice to prove people wrong and it's important that you never really lose that.\"</p><p>Thus far, McInnes's appointment at Pittodrie has been mutually beneficial. After years of underachievement, almost to the sad point where it was accepted, Aberdeen are a notable force once again. Amid what is a generally grim scene, that is clearly welcome; not least because of the following a successful Aberdeen can command. \"I'm from a generation that knows what successful Aberdeen teams were like,\" McInnes says.</p><p>McInnes has taken his side to second in Scotland's top flight. They are the overwhelming favourites to defeat Inverness at Celtic Park, which would end a 19-year wait for a trophy. \"I did feel optimistic during pre-season,\" says McInnes. \"I had enough conversations with the boys on an individual basis to know there was hunger there and the proper application. We just needed to bring consistency.</p><p>\"Every club fancies their chances of winning a cup. The most pleasing thing for me has been the consistency in the league because that was one thing that clearly hadn't been good enough for our club for the past wee while.\"</p><p>In what may well be interpreted as a broadside towards Craig Brown, whom McInnes replaced, the former West Bromwich Albion captain insists \"the whole football department needed sorting out\" when he took charge last March.</p><p>McInnes must also be credited for the form of Peter Pawlett, who has emerged as arguably the brightest young talent in Scotland after his switch to a central position. Previously, the 23-year-old midfielder had been best known for his diving exploits.</p><p>\"Pawlett we felt had more to offer than just being a wide player,\" McInnes says. \"He can play there but has more to offer where he has been playing. In a wider area, at times, he let games bypass him.</p><p>\"My first conversation with Peter, after two weeks in the job, was that he let training bypass him. Some days he would catch your eye and other days you just wouldn't see him. I said, 'you can't train like that, you've got to be able to come in and show yourself.' How you train doesn't always guarantee you a game but it can play you out the team. They had to see training was serious at the right time and show themselves.\"</p><p>McInnes, similarly, is to the fore once again.</p>","headline":"Derek McInnes has Aberdeen in tune as Inverness await","trailText":"<p>Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes is hungry for a League Cup victory against Inverness tomorrow folllowing a miserable end to his time at Bristol City</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/3/15/1394903205267/Aberdeens-Peter-Pawlett-r-006.jpg","wordcount":"707","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-18T23:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/derek-mcinnes-aberdeen-inverness-scotish-league-cup-final","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/15/derek-mcinnes-aberdeen-inverness-scotish-league-cup-final","tags":[{"id":"football/aberdeen","webTitle":"Aberdeen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/aberdeen","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/93"}]},{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

Hayes scored either side of strikes from Peter Pawlett and Adam Rooney to send the Dons into their first major cup final for 14 years.</p><p>Both sides had lost five semi-finals in the previous six seasons and it was the Dons who always looked like ending their run when Hayes opened the scoring in the third minute, although they had to withstand some concerted pressure before doubling their lead through Pawlett. Aberdeen, filled more than three-quarters of the 16,761 capacity crowd at Tynecastle, threatened even before the opener when Steve Banks scooped over Rooney's shot following a Barry Robson cross. The 41-year-old goalkeeper, who was continuing to deputise for the suspended and injured Alan Mannus, contributed to his side's early blow when he sliced a goal-kick 40 yards out on Aberdeen's right flank. Rooney latched on to it and raced down the line before delivering a square ball that Hayes guided just past the outstretched hand of the keeper. Aberdeen were struggling to relieve the pressure, but they broke to effect in the 32nd minute when Hayes won the ball from Croft and sprinted up the line. The Irishman initially only had Niall McGinn for support and his crossfield ball was cut out. But Pawlett ran on to the clearance and burst into the box before squeezing the ball inside Banks' near post. Aberdeen soon went further ahead in the 62nd minute following another counter-attack. Pawlett dispossessed Dave Mackay 10 yards inside his own half and threaded a ball between the St Johnstone central defence for Rooney to chase. The Irishman kept his composure and fired home from 18 yards to score his second goal in two games since his move from Oldham. Aberdeen were now firmly in command and Andrew Considine headed off the bar before Hayes completed the rout in the 79th minute when he ran at the Saints defence and fired a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from 16 yards..</p><p>In the Scottish Premiership, a controversial equaliser from Kris Boyd a minute into injury time earned <strong>Kilmarnock</strong> a share of the points after a hard-fought match on a poor pitch. Two first-half goals from Yoann Arquin and Yann Songo'o appeared to have put <strong>Ross County</strong> on course for their fourth win in their past six games. But after Boyd scored his 14th goal of the season two minutes into the second half, County were left clinging on with 10 men for the final 13 minutes after Filip Kiss was sent off, and Boyd took advantage at the death as County players protested for a foul.</p><p><strong>Partick Thistle</strong> are still searching for their first home victory of the SPFL season after goals from <strong>Dundee United's</strong> Farid El Alagui and the home side's Gary Fraser ensured a 1-1 draw at Firhill. El Alagui finished off a good United move just before the half-hour but Fraser restored parity in the second half after his corner was returned back to him.</p><p>In the First Division, <strong>Rangers</strong> beat Brechin 2-1 at Ibrox with first-half goals from Dean Shiels with 14 minutes played and a header from Jon Daly after 25 minutes. But the home side had to withstand the visitors pulling a goal back seven minutes after the interval and defender Bilel Mohsni being sent off after 61 minutes to maintain their 23-point advantage at the top.</p>","headline":"Jonny Hayes' goals inspire Aberdeen to 4-0 St Johnstone semi-final win","trailText":"Kris Boyd's controversial late goal earned Kilmarnock a point at home to Ross County and

Neil Lennon has grown weary of discussing troubled afternoons for Celtic at Hampden Park. Ross County, Kilmarnock, Hearts, Rangers and now St Mirren have ended Celtic silverware aspirations at the national stadium since Lennon became the manager.</p><p>In this instance, Lennon was rightly scathing of a Celtic display that could be generously described as lethargic and, otherwise, classed as astonishingly bad.</p><p>In proving Scottish football may be many things but is not yet completely predictable, Celtic's supposedly straightforward run to a domestic treble was ended at the League Cup's semi-final stage. St Mirren fully merited their victory, which earns them a meeting with Hearts in the final on 17 March.</p><p>\"That was a soulless performance from us,\" Lennon said. \"We lacked intensity, desire and a will to win. Some of them behaved like spoilt kids out there. The treble has gone and we only have ourselves to blame. We will get criticism and rightly so; that was an impersonation of the team I know.\"</p><p>Lennon can be accused of many things, but never of sugar-coating dismal performances. \"Defensively I thought we were awful,\" he said. \"This seems to be a bogey ground for us but that is the worst we have played here. That was awful, from what I regard as top-class players. Maybe I have got it wrong, maybe I need to look at changing things before the [transfer] window closes.\"</p><p>As has proved common when Celtic struggle, indications of a poor attitude were apparent from the kick-off. Lassad and Georgios Samaras were sluggish in attack, Joe Ledley and Victor Wanyama lacked midfield drive and St Mirren triggered panic in the Celtic defence every time they attacked. Celtic's goalkeeper, Lukasz Zaluska, looked unconvincing.</p><p>In contrast, the zest displayed by St Mirren, epitomised by John McGinn, Esmaël Gonçalves, Steven Thompson, Gary Teale and Conor Newton, belied their status as the team second from bottom in the Scottish Premier League.</p><p>Gonçalves, making his debut, clipped home St Mirren's opener when meeting a Newton cross. Celtic offered hints at a reply via Scott Brown, Gary Hooper and Samaras but were never convincing.</p><p>It was a surprise that Celtic snatched an equaliser just seconds before the break. Hooper converted from close range after smartly evading the St Mirren defence, with Brown the supplier.</p><p>Within five minutes of the restart, Celtic were fortunate to be afforded a chance to go in front. Jim Goodwin was harshly adjudged to be guilty of handball from a Lassad shot; justice was done when Craig Samson batted away Charlie Mulgrew's tame effort from the spot.</p><p>There was less argument about the next penalty, Mulgrew this time clearly benefitting from the use of an arm. Paul McGowan, once of Celtic, coolly slotted past Zaluska.</p><p>To their credit, St Mirren did not settle for that advantage. Thompson claimed their third, with a volley from Marc McAusland's cross that Zaluska will feel he should have done better with.</p><p>Celtic never looked to carry sufficient threat to haul themselves back into the tie. They did score again, Mulgrew concluding his eventful game by shooting home from outside the penalty area but it was too little and way too late for Celtic. St Mirren had secured a first Hampden win since they claimed the Scottish Cup here in 1987.</p><p>\"This is a monumental result for us,\" said Danny Lennon, the St Mirren manager. \"The players were different class. We were inspired by previous St Mirren wins over Celtic, right back to 1959.</p><p>\"The message we gave the players was to be fuelled by the belief that it can be done. We were probably written off by everyone in the media. That is something we have to deal with, as a small club playing the best team in the country. The gulf between Celtic and ourselves is enormous. But the same so-called experts wrote us off against Aberdeen in the quarter-final. They said it couldn't be done but here we are, in a final.\"</p><p>St Mirren are indeed within 90 minutes of glory; Celtic must divert their attention towards alternative prizes.</p><p><strong>Man of the match</strong> John McGinn  (St Mirren)</p>","headline":"St Mirren stun Celtic to reach the final of the Scottish League Cup","trailText":"Goals from Esmaël Gonçalves, Paul McGowan and Steven Thompson ensured St Mirren play Hearts in the final of the Scottish League Cup","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/1/27/1359305725020/St-Mirren-players-celebra-003.jpg","wordcount":"693","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-30T16:59:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/27/st-mirren-celtic-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2013/jan/27/st-mirren-celtic-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/stmirren","webTitle":"St Mirren","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/stmirren","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/stmirren","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/102"}]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

Down to 10 men, and taken to penalties by high-flying Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Hearts progressed to the final. Not since 1962 have the Edinburgh triumphed in this competition; twice on the run to the Hampden showpiece Hearts have won on penalty kicks. This time, by five goals to four.</p><p>In what soon regressed into an engrossing war of attrition, Andrew Shinnie and the Hearts debutant, Liverpool's loan forward Michael Ngoo, traded goals. Hearts had Scott Robinson sent off but a missed spot-kick by the Inverness substitute Philip Roberts sent John McGlynn and his players into raptures. There was jubilation, too, for the vast majority of an Easter Road crowd.</p><p>A key ingredient of Inverness' success this season has been continuity. A lack of injuries and suspension has allowed Terry Butcher to call upon basically the same players for the entire campaign; a luxury afforded to few managers.</p><p>Yet within that group are a clutch of players who have been among the most impressive in Scotland in recent months. It was an embarrassment, then, for Inverness as a city, Caledonian Thistle as a club and Scottish football in general that such a pitifully low number of supporters arrived for the north for this game. It marked only a second appearance for Inverness in a national semi-final, at three o'clock on a Saturday and with tickets easily affordable;  Butcher's work deserves greater recognition from the people of the Highlands .</p><p>In contrast, McGlynn surprised many with his selection for this tie. The youngsters Fraser Mullen and Callum Tapping made their first starts of the season with Jamie Walker, Jason Holt and Ngoo emphasising Hearts' fresh-faced appearance. Still, Hearts opened the semi-final as the brighter team. Another Liverpool loanee, Danny Wilson, forced Antonio Reguero into a low save before the Edinburgh team had a penalty claim denied as Walker tumbled over Graeme Shinnie's challenge.</p><p>A glorious Inverness chance was to follow. The Hearts defence to play offside as Andrew Shinnie lobbed a pass through for Billy McKay. The striker, who came into this match having scored 20 goals for his club this season, was unusually wasteful in allowing Jamie MacDonald to save. The encounter lacked nothing in niggle. With 24 minutes gone, Ngoo and Gary Warren received a caution apiece after a clash on the halfway line. For his part, Warren was fortunate not to escape more severe action having kicked out at the Hearts striker. Inverness's Richie Foran was similarly fortunate after a late foul on Walker, having already been booked.</p><p>Euan Norris was to offer a generally curious and erratic refereeing performance. Later in the match, McKay was strangely shown clemency when tugging back Andy Webster; again, a booking had already been issued. Ngoo, after that early caution, had half a dozen free-kicks given against him without another booking for persistent fouling .</p><p>Fittingly, given his prominence, it was Ngoo who came the closest to breaking the first-half parity. From Wilson's cross, the Ngoo headed off the inside of an Inverness post. Butcher's men went one better within five minutes of the restart. Andrew Driver was culpable in possession for Hearts, allowing Andrew Shinnie to drive into the penalty area. The midfielder, rightly courted by bigger clubs, supplied a fine, low and angled finish past MacDonald.</p><p>Hearts displayed admirable spirit to recover from that blow. Mullen's free-kick was knocked across goal and into Ngoo's path by Wilson; the forward volleyed beyond Reguero from close range. What had long-since seemed an inevitable red card arrived with 13 minutes of regulation time to play. Robinson lunged with two feet into Ross Draper, with Hearts' protests over Norris's dismissal in vain.</p><p>Extra time beckoned. In the first period of that, MacDonald supplied wonderful save from Andrew Shinnie, moments after McKay was again profligate in front of the Hearts goal. Roberts was similarly so, much to the cost of Inverness.</p>","headline":"Hearts crush Inverness' cup final dream in penalty shootout","trailText":"Hearts beat Inverness 5-4 on penalties to reach the Scottish League Cup final","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359226561183/Hearts-Ngoo-celebrates-hi-001.jpg","wordcount":"656","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-29T19:20:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/26/inverness-hearts-league-cup-semi-final","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2013/jan/26/inverness-hearts-league-cup-semi-final","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/invernesscaledonianthistle","webTitle":"Inverness Caledonian Thistle","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/invernesscaledonianthistle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/invernesscaledonianthistle","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1456"}]},{"id":"football/hearts","webTitle":"Hearts","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/hearts","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/98"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

Last year's beaten finalists claimed a place in the League Cup's last four at the expense of a St Johnstone team who arrived in Glasgow on excellent form but departed with a hammering. With Rangers facing Inverness in a quarter-final on Wednesdayevening, the prospect of an Old Firm tie remains very much alive.</p><p>Celtic were inspired by Kris Commons, who believes he scored a hat-trick. It remains to be seen whether or not his first is officially recorded as an own goal.</p><p>\"Kris is claiming it and rightly so,\" said Neil Lennon, the Celtic manager. \"That typifies his season so far: excellent, bright, alert and he has always been a good finisher. Tonight will have done him the world of good.\"</p><p>Scotland's League Cup is often denigrated but Celtic hardly lacked motivation ahead of this tie. Lennon had been scathing of his players' performance in losing 2-0 to Kilmarnock on Saturday with St Johnstone also victorious the last time they faced Celtic, on Scottish Premier League business last month.</p><p>\"I got everything that I wanted,\" added Lennon. \"We were back to our best tonight. From start to more or less finish we were dominant.\"</p><p>The hosts enjoyed territorial dominance during the early stages, with the opening goal seeming inevitable. Commons came the closest to settling Celtic nerves, with two long-range efforts that were scrambled away by Alan Mannus. There was little surprise, then, about Commons manufacturing the Celtic breakthrough. The midfielder had meek resistance from Dave Mackay when cutting inside the penalty area, with Commons firing in a low shot which was deflected past Mannus by the unfortunate Liam Craig.</p><p>Four minutes later, Celtic's advantage was doubled and St Johnstone's semi-final aspirations seemed fatally wounded. Mikael Lustig's pass infield was played into Commons's path by Gary Hooper. As the St Johnstone defence appealed in vain for offside, the Englishman lashed home a low shot.</p><p>Victor Wanyama – who hit the crossbar – and Lustig both came close to heading a Celtic third by the interval. In the latter case, Mackay was forced to head from his own goalline. Instead Hooper struck. This time Commons turned creator, with a low cross which the striker clinically converted with just a single touch.</p><p>The second half always had a damage limitation context for St Johnstone but Grégory Tadé passed up a decent opportunity to at least earn the Perth side a goal before Commons struck again. To Tade's credit, he stayed on his feet when apparently fouled inside the Celtic penalty area by Kelvin Wilson.</p><p>At the other end Tony Watt did tumble when pulled back by Steven Anderson. Commons instantly grabbed the ball and thumped the penalty past Mannus. In the former Derby County man's mind, at least, he had claimed a first hat-trick in Celtic colours.</p><p>Charlie Mulgrew, on as a half-time replacement for Hooper, scored Celtic's fifth as St Johnstone's defensive disarray was confirmed. This time, the Perth side failed to deal with a routine ball across their goal area.</p><p>\"Celtic were a class apart,\" said Steve Lomas, St Johnstone's manager.</p>","headline":"Kris Commons scores three times as Celtic hammer St Johnstone","trailText":"Kris Commons scored three times as Celtic hammered St Johnstone 5-0 in their Scottish Communities League Cup quarter-final","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351632717537/Soccer---Scottish-Communi-003.jpg","wordcount":"519","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-11-02T21:54:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/30/celtic-st-johnstone-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2012/oct/30/celtic-st-johnstone-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/stjohnstone","webTitle":"St Johnstone","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/stjohnstone","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/stjohnstone","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/115"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

There can be contrived, false outpourings of emotion. Similarly perspective regarding the various, significant ills of the world is routinely lost amid focus of what happens at a football ground.</p><p>A strong counterpoint to such matters is the coming together of football, and sport, when tragedy occurs. The sense of shock surrounding events at the end of yesterday's Scottish League Cup final between Celtic and Kilmarnock has developed into global, heartfelt sentiment towards Liam Kelly.</p><p>The Kilmarnock midfielder should today still be celebrating the finest achievement of his career. The 22-year-old was an integral part of the team which secured the League Cup for the first time in Kilmarnock's 143-year history.</p><p>Instead fate has issued Kelly and his family the cruellest of hands in front of his very eyes. The player's 59-year-old father, Jack, suffered a heart attack right on full-time at Hampden Park and his death at a Glasgow hospital was confirmed hours later.</p><p>If Kelly, a fine young player, ever had aspirations of receiving a message of support from Sepp Blatter, he would have wanted it in virtually any other circumstance than it arrived on Monday afternoon. Fifa's president said: \"Tragic news about Liam Kelly's father passing away after Kilmarnock's cup final win. My deepest sympathies to Liam and his family.\"</p><p>It is, in fact, almost impossible to quantify the size of the psychological challenge Kelly will now face when he eventually contemplates stepping back on to a football pitch.</p><p>It was clear from the immediate aftermath of the game, even to an untrained eye, that something was amiss in the Kilmarnock camp. Exactly what remained unclear only briefly.</p><p>Kelly did not collect a winners' medal or lift the trophy with his team-mates. Kilmarnock's manager, Kenny Shiels, also shunned the presentation to monitor the scale of the pitchside medical treatment being administered to Kelly Sr.</p><p>Kilmarnock's players went ahead with an open-top bus parade through the town on Sunday evening, with many of them made aware of Jack Kelly's death during that tour.</p><p>The squad's celebrations thereafter were muted, although many of Kilmarnock's supporters would not have been  aware until the morning of the tragedy that had befallen a popular member of their team.</p><p>As Kilmarnock's own website states: \"All the big emotions, Cammy Bell's heroics, Garry Hay's and James Fowler's first medals after long and distinguished careers, Dieter van Tornhout's first goal for the club on his birthday, all are dwarfed when real life butts in.\"</p><p>Celtic's manager, Neil Lennon, added: \"All of the management team, players and backroom staff wish to offer our thoughts and prayers to Liam Kelly's family.</p><p>\"Myself and the entire team are shocked and saddened with this news and our heartfelt condolences go to Liam.\"</p><p>Through no fault of anybody an historic moment for Scotland's oldest professional club will forever be tainted by a shocking turn of events. An old-fashioned cup upset, typified by strong spirit and a smart tactical approach, is rightly regarded as irrelevant against such a desperately sad backdrop.</p>","headline":"Kilmarnock's cup final joy cut short by death of Liam Kelly's father","trailText":"Ewan Murray: The death of Liam Kelly's father has overshadowed Kilmarnock's celebration at winning the League Cup with victory over Celtic","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2012/3/19/1332179207759/Deat-of-Liam-Kellys-fathe-003.jpg","wordcount":"500","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-03-26T21:42:22Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/mar/19/liam-kelly-father-death-kilmarnock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2012/mar/19/liam-kelly-father-death-kilmarnock","tags":[{"id":"football/kilmarnock","webTitle":"Kilmarnock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kilmarnock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/kilmarnock","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/123"}]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

The father of the Kilmarnock midfielder Liam Kelly collapsed with a suspected heart attack right on full-time in the Hampden stand. After watching 20 minutes of intensive medical treatment being given, Kelly left in tears without even collecting his winners' medal.</p><p>\"He is very, very seriously ill,\" said the Kilmarnock manager, Kenny Shiels. \"This is a tough emotion after such a high, after one of the best moments of our lives. The dressing room is very despondent. We are in a very difficult situation at the moment.\"</p><p>The substitute Dieter van Tornhout was the Kilmarnock hero after he headed the game's only goal with six minutes remaining. Shiels owed an equal debt of gratitude to his goalkeeper, Cammy Bell, who excelled while denying a series of Celtic chances. But it would be inaccurate to suggest Kilmarnock did not create opportunities of their own.</p><p>They claimed the trophy without conceding a single goal in the tournament. In the final, too many of Celtic's prominent players failed to perform.</p><p>Celtic's disappointment at the ending of their quest to claim a rare domestic treble was coloured by acrimony. Neil Lennon and his players were furious at the non-award of a stoppage-time penalty after Anthony Stokes was challenged by Michael Nelson. Rather than point to the spot, the referee, Willie Collum, booked Stokes for diving. Replays were not conclusive but Lennon offered a typically vehement post-match analysis. \"It was a stonewall penalty,\" Celtic's manager said. \"It was a shocking decision, absolutely shocking. It is a penalty and a red card [for Nelson]. For me, it is a criminal decision and it has cost us a treble. Awful, awful refereeing.\" The Scottish FA will not take kindly to such comments.</p><p>Lennon added: \"All you want is for officials to do their job properly. There is no way Anthony Stokes would go down when clean through on goal. That is a big call in the final, a huge moment. For me, he [the referee] got it horribly wrong. I have seen it four or five times now. It is a penalty, a clear penalty.\"</p><p>Via Twitter, Stokes's own assessment was: \"Any1 that thinks I wud dive wen I'm 1 on 1 wit d keeper needs their head checked.\" Lennon added: \"If you look at the game, Kilmarnock are very fortunate to win but congratulations to them.\"</p><p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Cammy Bell (Kilmarnock)</p>","headline":"Kilmarnock joy at Cup success over Celtic quickly followed by anguish","trailText":"Kilmarnock won the Scottish League Cup for the first time in their history to end Celtic's treble quest","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2012/3/18/1332092114982/Celtic-v-Kilmarnock-003.jpg","wordcount":"407","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-03-21T17:36:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/18/celtic-kilmarnock-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2012/mar/18/celtic-kilmarnock-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/kilmarnock","webTitle":"Kilmarnock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kilmarnock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/kilmarnock","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/123"}]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

It can often appear patronising when teams are praised for trying to play football in a positive manner despite the occasional horror result.</p><p>In Shiels's case, there is substance behind style. Despite pre-season predictions to the contrary, Kilmarnock's Premier League status is not in danger and they have an outside chance of reaching the top six before the division's annual split.</p><p>Within this campaign there has been a rare Kilmarnock win at Ibrox and, on Sunday at Hampden Park, there comes a chance for Shiels to claim tangible reward. Given the rebuilding job undertaken by the Northern Irishman since he succeeded Mixu Paatelainen – and the sparse resources available to do it – Shiels's work is worthy of recognition. Kilmarnock did not concede a goal on their run to the League Cup final against Celtic.</p><p>\"There has been a big psychological shift from when Mixu took over,\" Shiels says. \"When you get momentum then lose it as we did with Mixu leaving and players leaving, we had 15 journalists saying we were favourites for relegation this year.</p><p>\"Don't forget we were signing non-league players from England and only at a certain wage level. When you rebuild something it takes time and you could see the inconsistency in our performances. We garnered some togetherness but we could be doing better though.\"</p><p>Shiels regards it is no coincidence that Kilmarnock's most impressive performances have come against the best sides. They will surely need their strongest showing yet in the final, with Celtic on a seemingly unstoppable charge towards a domestic Treble.</p><p>\"Better pitches help us,\" says Shiels. \"Where we've failed this season has been in our inability to adapt our tactics to a difficult surface. We've tried to play too much – through my stubbornness – on pitches that weren't appropriate against teams who didn't want to play either.</p><p>\"What you'll see in the final is two teams trying to win. There are not many teams who'd be brave enough to do that against Celtic or Rangers. But when you have the ball you're not defending so that's our principle.\"</p><p>It was the defensive approach of Kilmarnock's local rivals, Ayr United, which caused a spat after the pair's semi-final. Shiels made it plain he thought little of Ayr's negative tactics, which, unsurprisingly, triggered a sharp response from the opposition.</p><p>\"If you look at the gap between Ayr and Kilmarnock it's nowhere near as huge as the gap between us and Celtic,\" Shiels says. \"The teams in the First Division and the bottom half of the SPL are of similar quality.</p><p>\"If I'm asked a question about the game and tell the truth about an opponent and it's a little bit negative, it's seen as controversial.</p><p>\"If we get hammered by Celtic 5-0 and I'm asked about Celtic, obviously it'll be complimentary, and it'll be the truth – but it's not controversial? Therein lies the problem.\"</p><p>History, as well at Celtic's form, hardly augurs well for Kilmarnock. The League Cup has never found a home at Rugby Park, with Kilmarnock defeated in their five previous final appearances. With that in mind, Shiels and his players have an opportunity to assume legendary status within the Ayrshire town.</p><p>\"Along the way you get highs and lows – apart from the Old Firm, where the highs outweigh the lows – but for a club like us it's a case of: 'Entertain us and get us to a semi-final or final.'</p><p>\"What a season our fans have had in terms of social bonding – just look at the semi-final against Ayr. Our support was unbelievable. Forget the result – just getting themselves pumped up and the adrenaline pumping would have made it worthwhile.</p><p>\"Winning the trophy? That makes a massive difference to this club. There are very few players outside the big three who have won something and I'd love us to do it. The chances of winning a cup in Scotland are slim.\"</p><p>But the return in terms of credit would be huge.</p>","headline":"Kenny Shiels bangs drum for Kilmarnock's bold approach to Celtic","trailText":"Kilmarnock have lost five finals but know only one way to play against Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final at Hampden","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/3/16/1331924758161/Celtics-Scott-Brown-003.jpg","wordcount":"666","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-03-20T23:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/17/kenny-shiels-kilmarnock-celtic-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2012/mar/17/kenny-shiels-kilmarnock-celtic-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/kilmarnock","webTitle":"Kilmarnock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kilmarnock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/kilmarnock","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/123"}]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

Neil Lennon's team have gone 18 domestic matches without defeat. Their deserved victory at Hampden, albeit over an impressively enterprising Falkirk side, secured a League Cup final meeting with Kilmarnock on 18 March. Celtic's run aside, the fact that Kilmarnock have competed in five finals in this competition without winning a single one points towards the likely outcome.</p><p>An uplifting contest could not pass without controversy. Steven Pressley, the Falkirk manager, watched the second period from the stand after complaining a little too vociferously as the teams left the field at half-time about the award of the penalty which led to Celtic's opening goal. In reality Darren Dods was guilty of something akin to a rugby tackle on Thomas Rogne.</p><p>\"I haven't seen it again so I will not say it wasn't a penalty,\" Pressley said. \"I&nbsp;would just ask, would it have been given in the other penalty box? That's all I'll ask. I am not proud of what happened at half-time. I am a passionate manager and I have to keep my emotions in check. I was just disappointed with a decision that had a huge bearing on the game.\"</p><p>Neil Lennon, the Celtic manager, was nonplussed about the affair. \"I know Steven was complaining about the penalty but Thomas said Dods had his arms round him and he was impeded,\" he said.</p><p>Lennon was more interested in an earlier disallowed Gary Hooper strike for Celtic, on account of a non-existent offside. \"It was onside. For me we had a good goal chalked off so I don't think they [Falkirk] can complain about the referee.\"</p><p>Such matters should not detract from an engaging semi-final. Pressley and his batch of promising young players are worthy of credit for their approach. Scott Brown sent Celtic in front after 27 minutes with a forceful spot-kick, at a time when the game was essentially even. Falkirk highlighted that with a fine equaliser, slotted home by Jay Fulton after a pass from the outstanding Karl Higginbotham.</p><p>Yet Celtic should have been back in front by the break. Rogne wasted a glorious opportunity from Brown's free-kick before James Forrest dallied sufficiently when through on Michael McGovern to allow the Falkirk goalkeeper to save. Fulton scooped over the bar six minutes into the second half but from there Lennon's men took a firm grip on proceedings. Rogne headed against the bar before Anthony Stokes sent the Premier League team back in front, with a sublime free-kick from 25 yards.</p><p>The Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster produced an excellent double save to deny Dods and Stewart Murdoch, emphasising why a third goal was needed to settle the tie. Stokes supplied it at close range after Hooper's cut-back.</p><p>Afterwards Lennon confirmed the Polish striker Pawel Brozek is on the verge of sealing a loan move to Celtic from Trabzonspor. Rangers had hoped to coax the 28-year-old to Ibrox. \"His record in Poland is excellent,\" said Lennon. \"Things haven't gone his way in Turkey but he's got the European Championship coming up, in his come country, so he'll be very motivated to book a place in the Polish squad. What we know is he's a goalscorer. I know Rangers were interested but we have been tracking him for a long time.\"</p><p>The manager will not let anybody at his club talk about a domestic treble but  there is a growing possibility of Celtic achieving it.</p>","headline":"Celtic reach final after Anthony Stokes scores twice against Falkirk","trailText":"Celtic will play Kilmarnock in the League Cup final in March after beating Falkirk 3-1 in the semi-final with two goals from Anthony Stokes","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2012/1/29/1327866620743/Anthony-Stokes-Celtic-Fal-003.jpg","wordcount":"567","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-02-01T19:52:18Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/29/falkirk-celtic-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2012/jan/29/falkirk-celtic-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/falkirk","webTitle":"Falkirk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/falkirk","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/108"}]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

In proving the old adage about semi-finals rarely being entertaining contests, Ayr United and Kilmarnock served up a 120-minute encounter that in spells could have made the eyes bleed. Kilmarnock will regard that as irrelevant; they earned an opportunity to break a League Cup final hoodoo thanks to Dean Shiels's extra-time winner.</p><p>More pertinently, that intervention earned Kilmarnock bragging rights over their local foes. The only visible battling thereafter was of the verbal kind, between the managers.</p><p>In Kilmarnock's defence, they offered elements of enterprise. Ayr's policy from the early minutes seemed perfectly clear; to make it to a penalty shoot-out and take their chances. Kenny Shiels, the victorious manager, was unimpressed. \"I'm relieved because football was the winner,\" he said.</p><p>\"Football is about entertainment, people pay money to be entertained. The easiest thing in the game is to defend, anybody can do that. It was a negative approach. I have never played like that, ever. I'm not hammering Ayr United, I'm just saying it would have been a better game if they had come out.\"</p><p>There is a debate to be had about the motivation behind Ayr's tactic, whether or not they were forced upon the manager, Brian Reid, due to a lack of resource or the First Division team were deliberately defensive. Scots can hardly be prissy about the approach, given the national team has profited and been praised for similar against superior opposition.</p><p>It made for an unattractive spectacle. Even more frustrating for any neutrals was the fact Ayr actually caused worry in the Kilmarnock defence after the goal.</p><p>\"Kenny should keep his opinions to himself,\" said Reid. \"He should comment on his own team, not other teams. Nobody would be saying that if we were through to the final.\"</p><p>A crowd in excess of 25,000 – the majority from Kilmarnock – turned out for a game that epitomised the spirit of what has been renamed the Scottish Communities League Cup. Families descended en masse on Hampden from Ayrshire, youngsters therefore indoctrinated into the fierce dislike these two sides have for each other, if they were not already aware. Only the dismal acoustics of Scotland's national stadium blunted the atmosphere.</p><p>The first 20 minutes would be described only through necessity. Kilmarnock wasted a series of first-half corners, the Ayr defender John Robertson subsequently heading a Garry Hay cross clear from just in front of his own goal. Shiels and Ben Gordon passed up Kilmarnock chances before the break but it was after the interval that the Premier League team stepped up their pressure. In spells, it resembled an attack versus defence training game.</p><p>James Dayton, Paul Heffernan, Hay and Gordon spurned Kilmarnock opportunities. The Ayr goalkeeper, Kevin Cuthbert, is also due credit for a superb save from Gary Harkins's close-range shot. Andy Geggan made sure Cameron Bell in the Kilmarnock goal was still awake with a long-range effort, seven minutes from the end of normal time.</p><p>Fittingly, the breakthrough arrived in untidy circumstances. Shiels and Heffernan saw shots blocked by Cuthbert before the manager's son stole back in to slam home. A Mark Roberts cross offered Ayr their best hope of a recovery, Kilmarnock's David Silva heading inches wide of his own goal amid panic.</p><p>Kilmarnock have lost all their previous five appearances in a League Cup final. On 18 March, either Celtic or Falkirk stand between Kilmarnock's class of 2012 and making history.</p>","headline":"Kilmarnock's Dean Shiels goes the extra mile to see off Ayr United","trailText":"Kilmarnock's Dean Shiels scored in extra time to beat a resolute Ayr United in the League Cup semi-final","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2012/1/28/1327761762260/Ayr-Uniteds-Jamie-McKerno-001.jpg","wordcount":"575","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-01-31T17:08:55Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/28/ayr-kilmarnock-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2012/jan/28/ayr-kilmarnock-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/ayr","webTitle":"Ayr","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ayr","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/ayr","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/105"}]},{"id":"football/kilmarnock","webTitle":"Kilmarnock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kilmarnock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/kilmarnock","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/123"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

Even at their respective football peaks, Ayr United and Kilmarnock weren't accustomed to frequent competitive meetings. As Kilmarnock became champions of Scotland, in 1965, Ayr were forced to re-apply for membership of the league after finishing last but one in the Second Division. Ayr's supporters, that said, take great delight in highlighting a 1-0 victory over Kilmarnock in the Ayrshire Cup final just days after that title had been secured.</p><p>Almost a decade later, it was Kilmarnock who toiled in a lower tier as Ayr enjoyed their most heady days in the top flight. It is little wonder, then, that Saturday's League Cup semi-final between these old foes is billed as the most significant Ayrshire derby ever.</p><p>The fierce nature of this fixture may be lost on those beyond the towns and villages of Ayrshire whose inhabitants will descend on Hampden Park. Or anybody who has not previously attended an Ayrshire derby. The ferocity, not least of language emanating from stands and terraces, is quite something to behold.</p><p>These towns lie 13 miles apart. Geographically, it is roughly suggested that support is split around Symington; with those north of that village following Kilmarnock and fans further south opting for Ayr.</p><p>\"I'm trying to be unbiased about it but I think the fixture tends to be a bigger attraction and means more to Ayr than to Kilmarnock,\" suggests Ronnie Hamilton, the youngest player to turn out for Kilmarnock in a Scottish league match and later the club chairman. \"Kilmarnock are the bigger club, with the better pedigree. It always seems easier for Ayr to raise their game.\"</p><p>Such sentiment is hotly disputed by Duncan Carmichael, Ayr's club historian. \"Kilmarnock had a huge win over Rangers in 1994 and their supporters were singing anti-Ayr songs in celebration,\" he says. \"Ayr were struggling at the time. No matter the league gap between us, Kilmarnock's supporters will be singing anti-Ayr songs. They are as bothered, all right. Rangers and Celtic supporters, even the hot-headed ones, have an element of mutual respect after a derby. With Ayr and Kilmarnock, there is an awful lot less give and take.\"</p><p>Kilmarnock lie seventh in the SPL with their part-time opponents sitting second-bottom of the First Division. That roughly paints a picture of history – Kilmarnock as the more prominent and successful club – but Kenny Shiels's men must be wary of complacency, their erratic form aside.</p><p>Ayr have won the past four League Cup meetings between the teams and have bundled three SPL sides – Inverness, Hearts and St Mirren – out of this season's competition. In consecutive seasons, 1998 and 1999, Ayr also eliminated Kilmarnock from the Scottish Cup.</p><p>\"They had won the cup in 1997 so those two wins meant we felt good about ourselves again,\" Carmichael says. \"I would argue this is probably the biggest game in Ayr's history, even although it is far from the best Ayr team. If we win on Saturday, I'll hardly even care about the final. My unfulfilled ambition is to see an open top bus parade a cup through Ayr. This year, there is a probably a better case for having that parade after the semi-final than the final.\"</p><p>Hampden may be only around half-full for this tie, but such an attendance must be put in context. At least 15,000 Kilmarnock supporters are expected in Glasgow. Such numbers weren't even commonplace at Rugby Park almost 50 years ago, when the championship was claimed and Kilmarnock were a regular force in Europe.</p><p>Ayr's anticipated following of 8,000 compares favourably with their last two home crowds; 1,310 and 1,407. An inability to move from or redevelop their decrepit Somerset Park home has been a major hindrance to Ayr's plans for progress over the past two decades.</p><p>Those who advocate the present, tight set-up of the SPL should take an added interest in the semi-final. Fixtures such as an Ayrshire derby, clearly attractive and lucrative, have been lost amid an unwillingness to move towards league expansion.</p><p>\"There are smaller numbers of fans than the Glasgow derby, but the rivalry is every bit as intense,\" says George Burley, the ex-Scotland manager and a native Ayrshireman. \"You have to remember how football-orientated Ayrshire is. A lot of top international players have come from there.\"</p><p>For 90 minutes on Glasgow's south side, that wider picture will be totally irrelevant.</p>","headline":"Ayr and Kilmarnock enjoy rare coming together in semi-final derby","trailText":"<strong>Ewan Murray:</strong> Many will be surprised how intense the League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park will be, but not those supporting Ayr or Kilmarnock","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/1/27/1327664840027/George-Burley-003.jpg","wordcount":"725","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-02-03T11:53:39Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/27/ayr-kilmarnock-league-cup-semi-final","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2012/jan/27/ayr-kilmarnock-league-cup-semi-final","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"football/ayr","webTitle":"Ayr","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ayr","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/ayr","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/105"}]},{"id":"football/kilmarnock","webTitle":"Kilmarnock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kilmarnock","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/kilmarnock","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/123"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

Forrest had endured a frustrating evening before firing a fierce, angled drive into the Hibs net to level the score. The tie soon tipped in Celtic's favour. Forrest played a one-two with Anthony Stokes on the edge of the Hibs penalty area before supplying a low finish.</p><p>Forrest also won the corner from which Ki picked out Stokes.

Ally McCoist, the Rangers manager, may publicly utter such sentiment – primarily as a criticism of his players – but reality suggests otherwise. The Rangers support rank championship wins, and victories over Celtic, above all other priorities.</p><p>Still, there have been fascinating and swift changes in the Glaswegian football dynamic. Rangers headed into last Sunday's meeting with Celtic as an embattled club, emerged deservedly successful in turning focus firmly towards Celtic and their manager, Neil Lennon, before Falkirk bundled McCoist's men out of the first domestic knock-out competition of the season. Cynics would suggest that sequence of events merely highlights how one would struggle to make a decent team out of Celtic and Rangers combined.</p><p>McCoist hasn't been subjected to the level of criticism which flew Lennon's way in the early part of the week. Yet the defeat to Falkirk, a First Division team whose resources make them dependent on a small, youthful squad, clearly wounded McCoist.</p><p>The League Cup has traditionally been dominated by Rangers, especially in recent times, with the Ibrox club competing in the last four finals. Rangers have won the tournament almost twice as many times as any other team.</p><p>An inappropriate mindset from the players notwithstanding, McCoist may have had his worst fears confirmed. That is, having to rely on those whom he doesn't regard as first choice for the remainder of the league campaign could prove problematic. McCoist had left Steven Naismith, Allan McGregor and Nikica Jelavic among the substitutes for Wednesday's tie – two of that trio were called for when things appeared grim.</p><p>Rangers' decent league form is in direct comparison with what has occurred elsewhere, Malmo and NK Maribor having already eliminated them from the Champions League and Europa League respectively.</p><p>As Rangers and Hearts – the latter club have a shocking League Cup record over the past five decades given their stature – faltered, Lennon was enjoying a straightforward evening. Celtic rarely looked in danger when dealing with the challenge of Ross County, in what proved an instant – if not total – recovery from a 4-2 loss at Ibrox.</p><p>Lennon's standing in the eyes of the Celtic following is without question. If it wasn't strong enough already, the level of backing given to the manager from all of those around the club was only enhanced amid the horrendous experiences Lennon had to deal with in his personal life last season.</p><p>On the field, what Lennon has to guard against is that Celtic don't regress from his decent debut campaign in office. Although he has only been seen in glimpses, Mohamed Bangura is yet to prove he is the right man in the right movie; new arrivals such as this were surely intended to improve the Celtic first team.</p><p>There are also issues about consistency of selection and managerial loyalty to players who make producing the level of quality Celtic require an exception rather than a rule.</p><p>In Anthony Stokes and Gary Hooper, Celtic have the most effective front pairing in the Scottish Premier League. Lennon's decision to omit Stokes, with Georgios Samaras taking the Irishman's place, against Rangers categorically failed to pay off.</p><p>Samaras profited against Rangers in the past, but against a weaker central defence than McCoist can presently deploy. In short, Celtic's retention of Samaras on a new contract isn't readily explained. Nor, in truth, is Lennon's habit of turning to the former Manchester City player.</p><p>The type of goal conceded by Celtic against Rangers highlights Lennon's other recurring problem: his defence. It remains bemusing, verging on baffling, that Celtic have been unable to find two central defenders who can be trusted week on week.</p><p>On Sunday Lennon should have fielded Charlie Mulgrew in that area, rather than using the 25-year-old on the left side of midfield in a failed attempt to stunt Naismith's forward advances.</p><p>Joe Ledley's omission at Ibrox left Lennon open to further, legitimate criticism, with the Welshman's ability to retain possession particularly useful away from home. If Ledley was left out because of his part in Atlético Madrid's opening goal against Celtic, there are more serial offenders who survive.</p><p>None of these matters render Lennon a bad manager. There is already considerable evidence that he is a good one. But the speed at which opinion – albeit temporarily – turned against him was eye-catching.</p><p>McCoist and Lennon are perfectly familiar with their working environments. Which is just as well.</p>","headline":"Losing to Falkirk upset Rangers – but beating Celtic still means more","trailText":"<strong>Ewan Murray: </strong>Ally McCoist has not been put under pressure by defeat in the Scottish League Cup, while support remains for Neil Lennon","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2011/9/23/1316772659852/Ally-McCoist-001.jpg","wordcount":"742","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-09-30T10:24:35Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/sep/23/rangers-ally-mccoist-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2011/sep/23/rangers-ally-mccoist-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/rangers","webTitle":"Rangers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/rangers","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/101"}]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/neil-lennon","webTitle":"Neil Lennon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/neil-lennon","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/neil-lennon","references":[]},{"id":"football/ally-mccoist","webTitle":"Ally McCoist","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ally-mccoist","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/ally-mccoist","references":[]},{"id":"football/scottish-league-cup-2010-11","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup 2010-11","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-league-cup-2010-11","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/scottish-league-cup-2010-11","references":[]},{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/scottish-premiership","webTitle":"Scottish Premiership","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/scottish-premiership","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/120"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.

But Mark Millar had the final say with a  stoppage-time winner as Falkirk booked their place in the fourth round.</p><p>The Rangers reserve goalkeeper Neil Alexander – who has started in every League Cup tie over the past two seasons – was drafted into the side for his first appearance this season. Alejandro Bedoya was handed his first start for the club, along with Lee McCulloch and David Healy.</p><p>Rangers started the match strongly. Gregg Wylde tried his luck with a shot from the edge of the area that was high and wide, before McCulloch tested the goalkeeper Michael McGovern with an effort from distance.</p><p>McGovern was called into action again, this time to block a left-foot drive from 20 yards from Bedoya. However, the best early chance of the match fell to Falkirk 10 minutes before the interval, when El Allagui connected with a corner and saw his shot cannon off the body of Wylde on the line, before Rhys Bennett fired wide from the rebound.</p><p>David Weatherston blasted over after finding himself in space as the home side threatened again. But there was a nervous moment for the Bairns just before half-time when, with Kyle Lafferty and Bedoya both down injured, Bennett attempted to put the ball out of play and almost fired into the back of his own net instead.</p><p>Jelavic was thrown into the action after 55 minutes but it was Falkirk who took the lead three minutes later. Kieran Duffie supplied the cross for El Allagui at the back post and he nodded past Alexander from close range.</p><p>Steven Naismith was immediately added to the action for Bedoya and was denied by a post after just two minutes on the park. The holders pushed forward in numbers and Naismith's header from a few yards out was touched over by the goalkeeper, before McCulloch rifled wide.</p><p>Instead, Falkirk doubled their advantage after 73 minutes. Craig Sibbald was the provider as El Allagui connected with a header in plenty of space and nodded past Alexander.</p><p>Rangers handed themselves a lifeline when Goian threw himself in front of Steven Whittaker's cross and bulleted home a header with eight minutes to go. What followed was an intense period of pressure as Naismith was again denied from close range before Jelavic sent a header home from a few yards out after 86 minutes.</p><p>But just when the tie looked set for extra time, Millar's shot deep into injury time was touched on to the underside of the bar by Alexander but he could not keep the effort out of the net as Falkirk claimed a dramatic late winner.</p>","headline":"El Allagui double helps Falkirk dump Rangers out of Scottish League Cup","trailText":"Mark Millar's stoppage-time winner for First Division side Falkirk knocked Rangers out of the Scottish League Cup","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2011/9/21/1316640437066/Falkirks-Mark-Millar-003.jpg","wordcount":"473","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-09-24T21:56:39Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/21/falkirk-rangers-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2011/sep/21/falkirk-rangers-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/falkirk","webTitle":"Falkirk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/falkirk","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/108"}]},{"id":"football/rangers","webTitle":"Rangers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/rangers","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/101"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/101"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/108"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-379358794","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2011/9/21/1316640435163/Falkirks-Mark-Millar-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Andrew Milligan","altText":"Falkirk's Mark Millar","height":"54","credit":"Andrew Milligan/PA","caption":"Falkirk's Mark Millar celebrates scoring the winner against Rangers in the Scottish League Cup third round.

It was County, after all, who inflicted such a famous bloody nose on Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final of 2010. Celtic's manager need not have fretted.</p><p>Lennon's team advanced into the last eight of the League Cup in a manner that was as straightforward as the score suggests. Gary Hooper set Celtic on course for victory with a 13th-minute strike and a Scott Boyd own goal condemned the First Division side to little more than a healthy pay cheque from this tie.</p><p>\"It was exactly the reaction I wanted,\" Lennon said, in reference to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/sep/18/steven-naismith-rangers-celtic-spl\" title=\"\">Sunday's 4-2 loss at Ibrox</a>. \"It was an excellent workout. We won't get carried away but it was a small step in the right direction.\" Lennon said his team's \"performance and professionalism\" had pleased him most. One of the most notable aspects of the fallout from the Glasgow derby has been the level of criticism aimed at the Celtic manager.</p><p>Lennon, more than anybody, knew the size of the firestorm that would have engulfed him had victory not been secured in the Highlands. Instead Rangers will make the headlines after they were knocked out of this cup by Falkirk.</p><p>In monsoon conditions, and with history in mind, this was a tie Celtic wanted to see out with a minimum of fuss. A cross from Anthony Stokes found the head of Joe Ledley, with the Wales international's effort little more than helped over the line by Hooper. Until that point, Celtic had been low-key.</p><p>County responded through Michael Gardyne, who thumped a superb 20-yard volley against a post. For the home support, that proved a false dawn.</p><p>Celtic could have been further ahead by the break as Ledley was smartly halted by the feet of the County goalkeeper, Michael Fraser. Lennon withdrew Kelvin Wilson at the break, the centre-half failing to recover after being clattered by Colin McMemamin. Wilson suffered an achilles injury which makes him a doubt for the weekend visit of Inverness.</p><p>It was another defender who settled the tie. Boyd, rather needlessly it must be said given the lack of pressure from any opponent, turned a Stokes cross beyond the stranded Fraser. Celtic, in turn, will praise Beram Kayal for the quality of the pass that picked out Stokes.</p><p>Celtic's pace when attacking made further scoring seem likely, although it was not forthcoming. Fraser produced another fine save to deny Hooper at close range and even more impressive acrobatics to deny the substitute Mohamed Bangura. With a victory and a clean sheet, Lennon will care little about that.</p>","headline":"Gary Hooper strikes to ensure Celtic don't slip up against Ross County","trailText":"Gary Hooper's early strike and a Scott Boyd own goal gave Celtic victory at Ross County","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/9/21/1316636898666/Ross-County-v-Celtic-003.jpg","wordcount":"447","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2011-09-24T20:37:24Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/21/ross-county-celtic-scottish-league-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2011/sep/21/ross-county-celtic-scottish-league-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/cis-insurance-cup","webTitle":"Scottish League Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/cis-insurance-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/321"}]},{"id":"football/celtic","webTitle":"Celtic","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/celtic","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/94"}]},{"id":"football/rosscounty","webTitle":"Ross County","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rosscounty","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/rosscounty","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/848"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ewanmurray","webTitle":"Ewan Murray","r2ContributorId":"22562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837835334/Ewan-Murray-byline-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ewan Murray is the Guardian and Observer's golf correspondent, with added responsibility for overseeing coverage of Scottish football.
