The former hair salon, now a sleek mélange of oak floors, white tiles and vintage tables, sits close enough to Bishopsgate to appeal to pinstriped nicotine cravers and sufficiently near Hoxton to attract hipsters seeking a post-prandial e-cigarette after sauntering from the Andean soul food restaurant just down the road.</p><p>\"We live here and we really love the vibes of this neighbourhood,\" said Pierre Durand, who co-owns the shop with fellow expat Frenchman and fellow City worker Jonathan Cadeilhan. \"Maybe this is the only place where you could start off this concept. People here are open-minded.\"</p><p>If only the same could be said of some of the passersby. Although the Vape Lab has been open for a mere five days, some Twitter users find the shop a perfect opportunity to riff on east-London stereotypes.</p><p>\"On Shoreditch High Street – obviously – there is now the Vape Lab, an e-cigarette and coffee shop,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnpmcdermott/status/445834540956016640\" title=\"\">wrote one</a>. \"Oh, it's just like Vienna, 1900.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/raquelle/status/445487192274927617\" title=\"\">Another</a> was even more withering: \"Jeeeeezus, just gone past 'The Vape Lab', an e-cigarette and coffee shop in Shoreditch *life spirit oozes out onto the floor of the bus*.\"</p><p>The affable and enthusiastic Durand and Cadeilhan, however, are confident that they know their products and their consumers.</p><p>The idea for the establishment, where punters can – as the website puts it – \"experience an old fashioned coffee and an e-cig with our exceptional range of fair-trade and organic Java and beautifully engineered electronic cigarettes\", was hatched in January, and by the beginning of March, the pair had found a shop and began making it over with the help of an interior designer friend.</p><p>Cadeilhan, who has seen e-cigarette shops proliferate in France, is convinced that the refillable brushed-metal devices that the store sells are the shape of fags to come. \"In France, it's a major market already – there are maybe more than a thousand shops in France and about 300 in Paris,\" he said. \"Here in London, it's a young market: you see people here with disposable cigarettes and they will switch to electronic cigarettes. In five years' time, there will be no more tobacco.\"</p><p>Electronic cigarettes, which are becoming increasingly popular, contain a battery and a heating element that warms a nicotine solution to create an odourless vapour – hence using e-cigarettes is known as vaping rather than smoking. Unlike smoking, it is legal to vape indoors.</p><p>The shop offers an extensive range of flavoured \"e-liquids\": from custard to Cuban tobacco, absinthe to gin and coconut to tangerine. And while its products do not come cheap – reusable base units start at £45; 10ml bottles of flavoured solutions at £7 – Durand and Cadeilhan argue that a 10ml bottle is equivalent to seven packets of normal cigarettes, making it a vastly cheaper fix.</p><p>They also insist that vaping could not be more different to its now-leprous forerunner. Supporters say the e-cigarette gives people a nicotine hit without the toxins that are present in tobacco cigarettes.</p><p>\"People sit here and talk to each other,\" says Durand. \"The vaping attitude is completely different. When you smoke, you have a cigarette, you have a short length of time, you have to go outside where it's cold. When you vape, you can relax. Most of the time, customers who don't know each other sit down and start having a chat.\"</p><p>Customers were not much in evidence when the Guardian visited the Vape Lab on Tuesday afternoon, but presumably even City types and hipsters have commitments that preclude an outright abandonment to weekday sybaritism. But if all goes well, the Vape Lab's owners wouldn't mind expanding their business to Mayfair and South Kensington, home to so many of their exiled countrymen.</p><p>First things first, though: Durand and Cadeilhan's next project is the establishment of a private molecular cocktail bar in the basement.</p>","headline":"London's first e-cigarette coffee shop opens its doors to capital's 'vapers'","trailText":"Vape Lab on Shoreditch High Street offers punters 'old fashioned coffee and beautifully engineered electronic cigarettes'","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395227228272/Pierre-Durand-and-Jonatho-006.jpg","wordcount":"686","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-22T14:00:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/london-first-e-cigarette-coffee-shop-vape-lab","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/london-first-e-cigarette-coffee-shop-vape-lab","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"society/smoking","webTitle":"Smoking","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/smoking","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/smoking","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/coffee","webTitle":"Coffee","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/coffee","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/coffee","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"profile/samjones","webTitle":"Sam Jones","rcsId":"GNL036708","r2ContributorId":"16394","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Jones is a reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/samjones","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432491913","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395227220507/Pierre-Durand-and-Jonatho-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Sean Smith","altText":"Pierre Durand and Jonathon Cadeilham in Vape Lab","height":"54","credit":"Sean Smith/Guardian","caption":"Vape Lab founders Pierre Durand (left) and Jonathon Cadeilham in their Shoreditch establishment.

It doesn't bother me, but if people come in here to drink – especially the workmen – they'll be welcome.\"</p><p>His wife, Natalie, was scarcely more effusive. \"We're used to it, with Ebbsfleet [International station] being built and Bluewater, so people are used to the disruption,\" she said.</p><p>Sue Martin, who lives in nearby Greenhithe but works at the Ebbsfleet Academy in Swanscombe, welcome the jobs and the homes the project would bring but was also worried about the roads. \"We're already clogged up and we don't need any more traffic,\" she said. \"Between October and February – because of the run-up to Christmas and then the January sales – the roads round Bluewater are jammed.\"</p><p>Their underwhelmed response is not wholly surprising. As well as the high-speed rail link, the shopping centre and the new garden city – not to mention the ambitious plans for a £2bn Paramount theme park in the area – Swanscombe is already the site of the 1,035-acre Castle Hill development, which will bring 150 new houses. The two-word slogans that decorate the multi-coloured fence enclosing the development ooze comfortable, commuter-belt aspiration: \"Develop &amp; Grow\"; \"Family &amp; Friends\", \"Lakes &amp; Parks\", and, rather more abstractly, \"Here &amp; There\".</p><p>Reece Henderson, a 30-year-old HGV driver who lives in Swanscombe, felt the chancellor's plan was a pragmatic one: \"With the amount of houses that are needed, it has to be done whether people like it or not.\"</p><p>Potential pockets of nimbyism aside, though, there seems to be little opposition to the new city, the proposed creation of which comes at a time when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/17/hs2-benefits-north-six-years-earlier-chairman\" title=\"\">the government is keen to highlight the benefits of high speed rail link</a>. The only question is how new Osborne's venture really is.</p><p>John Burden, the Labour leader of nearby Gravesham borough council, knew nothing of the garden city plan until he saw it announced on Sunday morning.</p><p>While he had yet to see the detail of the proposals, he said, they seemed in line with the planning permission that was granted a decade ago.</p><p>\"If the scheme is to build the houses in the Eastern Quarry – which is a longstanding planning permission – then I think it's a very good scheme and one that will benefit the area, particularly if it coincides with the building of the Paramount theme resort,\" he said. \"It would be very good for the area.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the Treasury said that local authorities had been consulted over then plans, adding that the chancellor's decision to use an urban development corporation (UDC) to drive the development of Ebbsfleet would ensure that everyone was given a say in the project.</p><p>Jeremy Kite, the Conservative leader of Dartford borough council (who was tipped off about the announcement on Saturday afternoon), felt the chancellor deserved praise for tackling the housing crisis.</p><p>\"The simple fact is that if you're interested in giving people houses, the key is whether there's any houses on the site,\" he said.</p><p>\"And the answer at the minute is that after eight years, there aren't any. It's all very well to say, 'We had a plan' and 'It's not a new plan' - but that plan didn't work and frankly it wasn't capable of being driven over the line.\"</p><p>Anyway, he added, the garden city would be far bigger than any previous planned housing projects and could help push through the construction of Paramount Park.</p><p>Both Burden and Sir Merrick Cockell, the chair of the Local Government Association, are worried by the involvement of an unelected UDC, but Kite believes the quango may succeed where other bodies have failed by moving swiftly past the planning phase and into the building one. Arguments over whether the garden city is an old idea or a new one were, he said, beside the point.</p><p>\"For me, this is about the long-term issue of delivery of housing.

Here’s an excerpt:<br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Why does the media have to gather footage of people in emotional turmoil? Principally, because it is part of the tragedy, just as much as what happened to the plane or the authorities’ responses. There is a need to record the whole story and to resist sanitizing the news by avoiding human suffering. Portraying grief can be done with sensitivity and care. For example, some coverage has used humanising factors in a respectful manner. Shots at the airport say much without commentary; the young Malaysian woman with the baby at her hip; older women sitting in silence; a small child being comforted as she cries.

The transponder</b></p><p>The transponder – a signal system that identifies the plane to radar – was shut off about an hour into the flight.</p><p>That’s not a straightforward thing to do. Someone in the cockpit would have to turn a knob with multiple selections to the off position while pressing down at the same time, said John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board. </p><p>However, it could also be learned by someone who researched the plane on the internet, Goglia said.</p><p><b>2. Acars</b></p><p>The Boeing 777’s Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars) – used to send short messages via a satellite or VHF radio – was shut off.</p><p>In most planes, the information part of the system can be shut down by hitting cockpit switches in sequence in order to get to a computer screen where an option must be selected using a keypad, said Goglia, an expert on aircraft maintenance.</p><p>Again, that could be done by the pilot or someone who had researched the system. </p><p>But to turn off the other part of the Acars, it would be necessary to go to an electronics bay beneath the cockpit. That’s something a pilot wouldn’t normally know how to do, Goglia said, and it wasn’t done in the case of the Malaysia plane. Thus, the ACARS transmitter continued to send out blips that were recorded by the satellite once an hour for four to five hours after the transponder was turned off. </p><p><b>3. Guided flight</b><br><br>After the transponder was turned off and civilian radar lost track of the plane, Malaysian military radar was able to continue to track the plane as it turned west.</p><p>The plane was then tracked along a known flight route across the peninsula until it was several hundred kilometres offshore and beyond the range of military radar. </p><p>Airliners normally fly from waypoint to waypoint where they can be seen by air traffic controllers who space them out so they don’t collide. These lanes in the sky aren’t straight lines. In order to follow that course, someone had to be guiding the plane, Goglia said.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-16T08:31:02.769Z\">at 7.31pm AEST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-53255382e4b0e42fe28276f6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-16T07:37:32.918Z\">6.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Hishammuddin seems to be flagging up on Twitter some of the stuff we think we might be getting details on at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/16/flight-mh370-police-focus-on-pilots-as-search-for-airliner-goes-on-live-updates#block-532541bce4b05ba05a3f8dc9\">the press conference later</a>. </p><p>This includes the news that police have spoken to captain Zaharie’s friends and family about the flight simulator he kept in his house<a href=\"http://\"> </a>and that police are investigating crew, passengers and engineers who may have had contact with MH370 before it took off.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53255189e4b05ba05a3f8dcb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-16T07:32:01.077Z\">6.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Malaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein has tweeted that he is talking to all countries involved in the revised search.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/H2OComms/statuses/445088725878317057\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Malaysian officials are currently discussing with all partners how best to deploy assets along the two corridors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MH370&amp;src=hash\">#MH370</a> -<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HishammuddinH2O\">@HishammuddinH2O</a></p>&mdash; H2O Comms (@H2OComms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/H2OComms/statuses/445088725878317057\">March 16, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>And that it continues to be a multinational effort.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/H2OComms/statuses/445087597778714624\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The search and rescue operation continues to be a multi-national effort, led by Malaysia. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MH370&amp;src=hash\">#MH370</a> -<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HishammuddinH2O\">@HishammuddinH2O</a></p>&mdash; H2O Comms (@H2OComms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/H2OComms/statuses/445087597778714624\">March 16, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/H2OComms/status/445087597778714624\">He lists the countries now involved</a> as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia &amp; France.

changed under the peculiarly popular pontiff?","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>A year ago, on 13 March 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, became the 266th head of the Roman Catholic church. His predecessor, Benedict XVI, had resigned the month before, citing a decline in his physical and mental strength, leading to an almost unprecedented handover of power. After the remote, intellectual German theologian came the church's first Jesuit leader, its first Latin American pontiff – and the first pope to take the name of Francis.</p><p>The pope was elected with a mandate to shake up the church in Rome and help turn the page on an increasingly fraught and scandal-bedevilled papacy. His many fans argue he has vigorously pursued a reformist agenda within the Vatican while radically improving the church's image outside it. But, as Rome marks his first anniversary, just how successful has this peculiarly popular pontiff been?</p><h2>Good works<br /></h2><p><strong>Image management</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431978522'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394628587405/Pope-Francis-Vinicio-Riva-011.jpg' alt='Pope Francis Vinicio Riva' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pope Francis blesses Vinicio Riva in November. Photograph: Claudio Peri/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>Talk of the \"Pope Francis effect\" is ubiquitous for a reason: since stepping out on to the balcony of St Peter's on the evening of 13 March 2013 to joke that the cardinal-electors had been forced to cast their nets to \"the end of the Earth\" to find a successor to Benedict, Jorge Mario Bergoglio has scarcely put a humbly shod foot wrong PR-wise. Despite adhering to church teaching as closely as his predecessor, Francis has, through a mixture of charm, humour and openness, turned many preconceptions – and prejudices – on their heads. His decision to abjure the splendour of the apostolic palace in favour of the modest Casa Santa Marta guesthouse has offered proof of his personal commitment to a humbler church, while his tender embracing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/pope-francis-kisses-disfigured-man\" title=\"\">Vinicio Riva, a man terribly disfigured by tumours</a>, underlined his hands-on pastoral approach. Such actions saw him voted person of the year by both Time magazine and the US gay and lesbian magazine The Advocate, while his Twitter account - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pontifex\" title=\"\">@pontifex</a> – has almost 3.8 million followers.</p><p><strong>Church governance</strong></p><p>Francis's decision to appoint eight  \"outsider\" cardinals to advise him on church reform was described by one observer as the \"most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries\". The council, which includes cardinals from the US, Australia, India, Honduras and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has inevitably been dubbed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/01/pope-francis-narcissistic-papal-curia\" title=\"\">the papal G8</a>. \"[They are] not courtiers but wise people who share my feelings,\" said Francis, who has often been scathing about the \"introspective and Vatican-centric\" nature of the Holy See. \"This is the start of a church with not just a vertical but horizontal organisation.\" Jesuits, who have had to wait almost 500 years to see one of their number sit on the papal throne, proudly point out that consultation is one of the foundations of their order.</p><p><strong>Overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431978523'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394629348142/Pope-Francis-meets-bishop-011.jpg' alt='Pope Francis meets bishops' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pope Francis meets bishops at the end of his weekly general audience, in St Peter's Square last month. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP</figcaption></figure><p>As well as assembling his own G8, Francis has revamped the powerful  Congregation for Bishops, the Vatican department responsible for selecting bishops. <a href=\"http://www.thetablet.co.uk/world-news/5/1138/0/congregation-for-bishops-feels-heat-of-francis-reforms\" title=\"\">By appointing 12 new members and not confirming 14 existing members</a>, he rebalanced the department to make it more moderate and progressive. Among those who were not confirmed was the highly influential conservative US cardinal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/20/uselections2004.usa3\" title=\"\">Raymond Burke, who has been an outspoken critic of US presidential candidates who are in favour of abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning and same-sex marriage</a>. New members include Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales praised for his pastoral and inclusive style, whom Francis made a cardinal last month. The papal historian Michael Walsh described the overhaul of the congregation as a \"tectonic shift\" in governance.</p><p><strong>Inclusivity</strong></p><p>On Maundy Thursday 2013, a fortnight after becoming pope, Francis exhorted his priests to abandon introspection and to get out \"to the outskirts where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/28/pope-francis-women-feet-washing\" title=\"\">He washed and kissed the feet of two Muslims – one a woman – at a youth detention centre near Rome</a>. It was the first time a pontiff had included women in the ceremony. For many, the greatest proof of the pope's commitment to inclusivity and his desire to appeal to those who have long felt ignored or criticised by the church came during an impromptu press conference on a flight back from Brazil in July. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/pope-francis-openness-gay-priests\" title=\"\">\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?\"</a> he asked journalists.</p><p><strong>Anglican relations </strong></p><p>Francis's determination to \"intensify dialogue among the various religions\" has not been confined to reaching out to Jews and Muslims. Last<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/14/pope-archbishop-canterbury-talks-rome\" title=\"\"> June, he had lunch with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the pair chatted for four hours</a>. Despite frosty relations that have existed between the churches in recent years – caused mainly by the C of E's decision to ordain women and Pope Benedict's creation of an ordinariate to bring disaffected Anglicans into the embrace of Rome – Francis and Welby appear to have a genuine rapport. According to Sir David Moxon, the archbishop of Canterbury's representative to the Holy See and director of the Anglican centre in Rome, there was an \"immediate chemistry\" between the two leaders, whom Moxon describes as \"men of action\" equally committed to tackling poverty and social injustice. It has not hurt that Welby's personal spiritual director is a Benedictine monk; nor that the archbishop recently signalled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/chuch-of-england-catholics-lambeth-palace\" title=\"\">a further rapprochement by inviting members of a Roman Catholic ecumenical community to take up residence in Lambeth Palace</a>.</p><p><strong>Political player</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431978524'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394561463985/Pope-kissing-prisoners-fo-011.jpg' alt='Pope kissing prisoner's foot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pope Francis (kissing the feet of a young offender during a mass at the church of the Casal del Marmo youth prison on the outskirts of Rome in 2013. Photograph: AFP</figcaption></figure><p>It was no accident that Francis chose a career Vatican diplomat, Pietro Parolin, as his secretary of state, a position often likened to the papal prime minister. The pope has shown a desire to put the Vatican back on the international stage as a key player in external – not just messy, internal – affairs, and his stance on Syria has been the clearest sign that under him the Catholic church's voice will be loud and clear. With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/pope-g20-syria-peace-talks\" title=\"\">an open letter to the leaders of the G20</a>, repeated exhortations for a non-violent, mediated solution, and a day-long fast and mass prayer vigil, he provided a moral counterweight to the Obama administration and its proposed air strikes. His powerful criticisms of capitalist excesses have seen the church regain relevance in the contemporary debate on social justice. And his decision to make Lampedusa the location of his first trip outside Rome, slamming a \"globalisation of indifference\" that allowed migrants to die in the Mediterranean, he focused the eyes of the world on an often-overlooked problem.\"</p><h2><strong>The jury's out</strong></h2><p><strong>Curia reform </strong></p><p>The \"outsider\" pope was elected with a mandate to come to Rome and bang heads together. In the fading light of Benedict's papacy, infighting and corruption within the Curia – the Vatican's central bureaucracy – had dominated amid the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/28/vatileaks-scandal-pope-butler-gabriele\" title=\"\">Vatileaks</a> affair. Francis has announced measures to engender reform, most notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/george-pell-called-to-vatican-to-oversee-budget-as-pope-looks-to-cut-waste\" title=\"\">the creation of a secretariat of the economy</a> – a kind of finance ministry – to centralise the handling of business and administrative affairs. That will be led by the outspoken Australian Cardinal George Pell. The other key staffing decision was to replace the widely discredited Tarcisio Bertone as secretary of state –a symbolic and practical move Francis must hope will draw a line under an era of scandal and incompetence.</p><p><strong>Core teachings</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431978525'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394562024180/The-pope-in-a-selfie-009.jpg' alt='The pope in a selfie' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The pope appearing in a selfie taken by young pilgrims in St Peter's, Rome. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations. The pope has made clear his commitment to core church teachings on issues such as abortion and women's ordination. But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all. For one thing, Francis has said the church needs a \"new balance\" and a less condemnatory attitude to sexual morality. For another, he has shown himself to be a pragmatic conservative, committed to doctrine but concerned with how the church responds to pastoral realities. In concrete terms, speculation centres on whether he will see fit to announce a shift on the treatment of remarried divorcees, now banned from receiving holy communion. Walter Kasper,  the cardinal Francis chose to speak on the subject at a consistory earlier this year, told La Repubblica newspaper this week that the church should try to find a \"realistic application of doctrine\", adding: \"The church must never judge as though it had a guillotine in its hands.\"</p><p><strong>Vatican Bank</strong></p><p>All too often <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/vatican-bank-scandal-director-resigns\" title=\"\">the cause of embarrassment for the papacy</a>, the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) is at the heart of Francis's reform – and ethical finance – agenda. He has set up a commission of lay experts and clerics to investigate the bank's running, and has replaced four of five cardinals appointed under Benedict on an oversight body. Under German president Ernst von Freyberg, the bank is trying to improve transparency and has hired an outside firm of accountants to help it meet international standards. But an Italian investigation into allegations of money laundering – which the bank denies – continues and a report by a Council of Europe body, Moneyval, in December said the IOR still had some way to go. Francis has made it clear that, if the bank cannot be adequately reformed, he would have no compunction about closing it for good.</p><h2>Must try harder<br /></h2><p><strong>Clerical sex abuse </strong></p><p>There are growing suspicions that this, more than any other issue, is emerging as Francis's blind spot. Critics say he has done little to ramp up the church's response to the scandal. Though he has said officials must \"act decisively\" on the problem – and in December announced a new commission to examine ways of better protecting children and helping victims – most advocates for abuse victims say another commission is not what is needed and criticise him for not making the deep changes they, and the UN, say are necessary. They have been left despondent by Francis's occasional comments on the issue, in which he has generally defended the church while condemning the abuse. An interview published this month in which he claimed that no other institution had acted with the same \"transparency and responsibility\" elicited particular anger. <a href=\"http://ncronline.org/blogs/examining-crisis/pope-francis-abuse-disappointment\" title=\"\">\"His comments about clerical sex abuse [in the interview] make it clear that he is using the same tired and irrelevant playbook the bishops have worn out over the past few years,\"</a> wrote priest and victims' supporter Tom Doyle in the National Catholic Reporter.</p>","headline":"12 months a pope: Francis's report card after a year at the top","trailText":"<p>Aside from the gestures of inclusivity, how much has really changed under the peculiarly popular pontiff?</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394627449255/Pope-in-Rome-006.jpg","wordcount":"1694","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-16T06:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/pope-francis-report-card","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/13/pope-francis-report-card","tags":[{"id":"world/pope-francis","webTitle":"Pope Francis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pope-francis","references":[]},{"id":"world/the-papacy","webTitle":"The papacy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-papacy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/the-papacy","references":[]},{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catholicism","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/christianity","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/samjones","webTitle":"Sam Jones","rcsId":"GNL036708","r2ContributorId":"16394","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Jones is a reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/samjones","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lizzydavies","webTitle":"Lizzy Davies","r2ContributorId":"25822","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Lizzy Davies is Rome correspondent for the Guardian.

Eighteen are planned as office developments, eight as hotels and 13 are due for mixed use, while one tower is to be an educational institute.</p><p>According to the study, which is based on local authority figures, 48% of the towers have been approved and another 19% are under construction. Thirty-three of the 236 will be between 40 and 49 storeys high; 22 will have 50 or more storeys.</p><p>At the heart of the new tower boom is Tower Hamlets, in east London, which is to be home to 23% of the new buildings. Projects in east and central London account for 77% of the total, although south London also faces significant vertical development. Between them, Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Greenwich, Newham and Southwark will have 140 of the 236 towers.</p><p>Peter Murray, director of the NLA, said the survey had been prompted by remarks made by the London mayor, Boris Johnson as he announced his revised housing strategy at the end of last year.</p><p>\"He said that we've got to build 42,000 new houses every year, but it won't mean towers are 'popping up all over London', as he put it,\" said Murray.</p><p>\"But then we started looking at some of the statistics coming in from various boroughs as to the sorts of buildings they were giving permission to, and we realised that actually it does mean that: just like in the 1960s, when we had to build a whole lot of houses, we are going to go higher than I think a lot of people in London had imagined.\"</p><p>And, judging by his comments, higher than Boris imagined as well.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431977558'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394699129839/Proposed-new-London-tower-011.jpg' alt='Proposed new London towers' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Looking west from the City, how London will look with the addition of planned towers. Illustration: Hayes Davidson/Jason Hawkes</figcaption></figure><p>The survey is the thinktank's way of attempting to gauge the effect the new towers will have on the London skyline and the shape of the city as a whole.</p><p>\"I've got nothing against towers at all, but we need to understand what the impact is,\" said Murray. \"We need to make sure we have a planning system that really is fit for purpose to properly do what planning is supposed to do: to provide a vision for the city in the future and to control the way that development takes place in a reasonable manner.\"</p><p>Murray, who believes the current system could do with some \"beefing up\", points to the huge pressures on the Greater London Assembly and local authorities to deliver more housing at a time of very high land prices. Faced with such prices, developers are understandably keen to build high, he says. The situation is further compounded by increasing demand for housing in London from the east Asia, where tall buildings have long been part of the urban landscape.</p><p>Sir Edward Lister, London's deputy mayor for planning, said a strategic approach was required to balance the protection of the city's skyline with the need to house 1 million more people and create more than 500,000 new jobs over the next few years.</p><p>\"What we can't do is try to impose some kind of freeze on the skyline and suspend the capital in stasis,\" he said.</p><p>\"The key issue in any discussion of London's skyline is whether a building makes a positive contribution to London's urban realm, protecting the things we value about our city while helping us meet the challenges of growth and ensuring the continued prosperity of London and Londoners.\"</p><p>The NLA, which is now examining people's attitudes to tall buildings, believes the public is more receptive to high-rise buildings than it once was.</p><p>\"There's a greater acceptance of towers because generally the architecture is more interesting than it was in the 1960s, when there was a general antagonism towards taller buildings,\" said Murray. \"I think buildings like the Gherkin – which people generally like – have restored people's faith in the ability of architects to put up buildings that can enhance the skyline rather than damage it.\"</p>","headline":"The stretched middle: can Londoners cope with hundreds of new towers?","trailText":"<p>With its skyline about to expand further upward, the city may one day look back on

He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.\"</p><p>Crow left school at 16 to work on the tube, and became a local union rep for the first time aged 20. In later years, the shaven-headed, Millwall-supporting Crow was easily caricatured in the rightwing press – particularly during tube strikes or when his union demanded, and won, Olympic bonuses for workers. But while he was unafraid to call a strike, associates remember him as a shrewd negotiator who knew when to settle and how to play his hand.</p><p>His defiance over his well-publicised cruise holiday to Brazil on the eve of the recent tube strike was typical: why, he asked, wasn't a working man allowed to spend his money on a holiday? It had been advertised in the Daily Mail.</p><p>In one of his last interviews, he told the BBC: \"At the end of the day, to be the general secretary of a union you have to be larger than life. I wouldn't want to walk around in a grey suit and eat a cheese sandwich every lunchtime. I'd want someone who's got a bit of sparkle about them.\"</p><p>Crow's death came during talks over the tube's future, as the union continued to resist plans to shut ticket offices and cut jobs. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA union, which had joined the dispute with the RMT, said he was \"proud and privileged to have stood alongside Bob\". He added: \"While many bosses might not have said it in public, he carried their respect. He understood that his job was to get the best possible deal for his members. That is what he always did.\"</p><p>The offices of the RMT union were closed on Tuesday. The RMT said it would make further announcements in due course.</p><p>It is understood that Millwall football club will include a tribute to Crow in its programme for the game against Charlton on Saturday.</p>","headline":"Bob Crow, RMT leader, dies of suspected heart attack at 52","trailText":"<p>Fellow unionists and politicians, including Boris Johnson, pay tribute to union leader who was 'a fighter and a character'</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394533191697/Bob-Crow-003.jpg","wordcount":"758","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-14T10:21:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/11/bob-crow-dies-52-rmt-union-leader","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/mar/11/bob-crow-dies-52-rmt-union-leader","tags":[{"id":"politics/bob-crow","webTitle":"Bob Crow","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/bob-crow","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/bob-crow","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/rail-transport","webTitle":"Rail transport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rail-transport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/rail-transport","references":[]},{"id":"uk/transport","webTitle":"Transport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/transport","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/tradeunions","webTitle":"Trade unions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/tradeunions","references":[]},{"id":"profile/samjones","webTitle":"Sam Jones","rcsId":"GNL036708","r2ContributorId":"16394","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Jones is a reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/samjones","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gwyntopham","webTitle":"Gwyn Topham","rcsId":"GNL004653","r2ContributorId":"15685","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/8/1268051831911/topham.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Gwyn Topham is the Guardian and Observer's transport correspondent.

opens up a debate on much more than just animal welfare","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>If, after raising the issue for almost three decades, the British Veterinary Association was beginning to despair of ever securing front-page coverage for its campaign to ensure all animals are stunned before slaughter, it can breathe a sigh of relief. But probably a very short and shallow one.</p><p>Thanks to the interview its new head gave to the Times – picked up by the Today programme and countless others – the matter is now nothing if not high-profile. And, coming weeks after Denmark in effect outlawed kosher and halal slaughter, it is certainly topical, which may explain why the BVA's president-elect, John Blackwell, judged it a more alluring target than even the government's badger cull.</p><p>Blackwell's suggestion that the UK \"may well\" have to follow Denmark's example if British Jews and Muslims refuse to allow animals to be stunned before they are killed did not please the groups concerned. Nor did his assertion that cutting the throat of an animal without stunning it caused prolonged and unnecessary suffering.</p><p>\"They will feel the cut,\" he said. \"They will feel the massive injury of the tissues to the neck. They will perceive the aspiration of blood they will breathe in before they lose consciousness.\"</p><p>Although the BVA is a seasoned campaigner on the issue – and has also urged the government to label non-stunned meat to alert consumers to its origins – Blackwell's intervention has met with a swift and furious response from Jewish and Muslim groups, who argue their long-practised methods are completely humane. They have also hinted his comments could be used by far-right groups to stir up community tensions.</p><p>\"He has made the extraordinarily misleading statement that what Jews do and Muslims do is to slit animals' throats and allow them to bleed to death,\" said Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. \"That is unbelievably misleading because he must know that the way the animal is killed is to cut its throat so as to bring about an immediate and irreversible loss of sensation and death.\"</p><p>Suggestions that the animal had its throat cut \"and you just watch it while it bleeds to death\", said Arkush, were pejorative, misleading and \"could not be further from the truth\".</p><p>Shimon Cohen, campaign director at Shechita UK – which campaigns for the right to carry out Jewish religious slaughter – described Blackwell's calls as \"an extraordinary dereliction of duty\" and asked why he had decided to focus on an issue that affected only a tiny minority of animals.</p><p>Although Shechita UK has no figures for the number of lambs and sheep slaughtered according to Jewish law in the UK each year, it estimates the number of cows to be 15,000-20,000 and the number of chickens to be around 1m. Figures from <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/compassion_news/president_of_bva_says_stop_slaughter_without_stunning.aspx\" title=\"\">Compassion in World Farming </a> suggest that 32m chickens and 70,000 cattle are slaughtered without being stunned in the UK each year.</p><p>\"The fact is that religious slaughter is at least as humane as the industrialised methods used in conventional mechanical slaughter, which include electrocution, gassing, shooting, trapping, drowning and clubbing,\" said Cohen. His views were echoed by Arkush, who said that 9% of animals in the UK were mis-stunned, causing them pain and distress before slaughter, adding that European veterinary bodies put the figure at around 31%.</p><p>\"Let's call it 9%: in this country, the total number of animals who suffer mis-stunning exceeds the whole number of animals killed for the kosher market by a factor of 10,\" he said. \"If you've got 10 times as many animals mis-stunned as you have kosher, surely you should be attacking that?\"</p><p>Arkush also said he feared that the Danish government had introduced the ban as a reaction to increasing public discontent over Muslim immigration.</p><p>\"This was a political move; a populist move because there has in fact been no shechita in Denmark for 10 years because the community there is too minuscule and it wouldn't be economic,\" he said. \"Why pass a law about it? Denmark was not done out of consideration for animal welfare but out of consideration for popular, anti-immigration sentiment.\"</p><p>Dr Shuja Shafi, the deputy secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said he was disappointed that the issue of religious slaughter had been brought up yet again. \"Halal is a humane method; it's a clean, clear method and has got rules and regulations about how it's carried out,\" he said. \"Stunning has got lots of problems in itself … and if it's not done properly, actually animals are a lot worse off.\"</p><p>He also said that focusing on minority religious practices \"could give ammunition\" to the far right, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/25/halal-food-why-hard-find-britain\" title=\"\">which already uses halal slaughter as a means to try to attack the Muslim community</a>. \"People should be more responsible in how they tackle this. It's going to cause confusion and will be used by elements to have a negative effect.\" Blackwell told the Guardian that while a ban \"may well be the end point\", he would prefer to get all the groups involved together so that they could discuss the scientific evidence on stunning. He  admitted that human and operator error would inevitably lead to some mis-stunning but said he did not accept that it was as common as had been suggested.</p><p>\"I've heard talk today of anything between 9% and 31%, and I just don't buy that,\" he said. \"There are veterinary surgeons working continuously in plants, monitoring the welfare aspects of the animal from the moment it arrives … to the moment it's killed.\"</p><p>Asked why he had chosen to raise the issue of religious slaughter rather than comment on intensive farming or the badger cull, he said: \"This isn't a single-policy issue; it's part of a portfolio of issues. Welfare is very important, if not the most important thing, to veterinary surgeons. It's almost our raison d'être to try to improve welfare, and as far as animal production goes, we're concerned with the welfare from the birth of the animal till its final slaughter.\"</p><p>Blackwell also said that while the BVA acknowledged the sensitive nature of the debate, it was not seeking to stir up a religious or political debate on the issue of slaughter.</p><p>\"We're just trying to take the moral high ground on behalf of the animal,\" he said. \"It's not about trying to clamp down on people's very, very well-held beliefs; it's about moving forward and looking at the issues and seeing that if we can't have a ban, then how can we fine-tune it so the welfare of the animals is not compromised at slaughter?\"</p><p>Blackwell's calls won the support of Compassion in World Farming, which said stunning worked and was merciful.</p><p>\"In the UK, 1.4m sheep and goats, 32m chickens and 70,000 cattle are slaughtered without being stunned each year,\" said its chief policy adviser. \"There is clear scientific evidence which shows that animals suffer when they are slaughtered without being stunned.\"</p><p>The response from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was rather more guarded. \"We respect the rights of religious communities to eat meat prepared in accordance with their religious beliefs,\" said a spokeswoman. \"There are strict laws in place to ensure welfare standards are met during slaughter.\"</p>","headline":"Halal, shechita and the politics of animal slaughter","trailText":"Sam Jones: The British Veterinary Association's campaign opens up a

In it, the journalist and author probes the “paranoid imaginings of suburban South Africa”.

It will be a battle of ‘expert’ opinions because the uncontested fact is that on Valentine’s Day last year Pistorius fired four shots at close range through a locked bathroom door and killed Reeva Steenkamp. This is not in dispute.</p><p>What is in dispute is his claim that he did not intend to kill his girlfriend. He says he was shooting at somebody else; that he thought there was an ‘intruder’ in the bathroom; that this killing was a mistake; that it was not just another South African femicide.</p><p>So the trial will revolve around Pistorius’ intention: essentially, the psychology of a man who claims to have been driven by fear to shoot before asking any questions. This claim inserts a third body into an all too familiar narrative of domestic violence. This imaginary body of the paranoid imaginings of suburban South Africa has lurked like a bogeyman at the periphery of this story for the past year. It is the threatening body, nameless and faceless, of an armed and dangerous black intruder ...<br></p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53158035e4b0da1677ed2cb0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-04T07:26:50.359Z\">7.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SmithInAfrica/statuses/440748142649024512\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Pistorius&amp;src=hash\">#Pistorius</a> enters high court in Pretoria with bodyguard holding arm and police shouting &quot;make way&quot; amid much pushing and shoving.</p>&mdash; David Smith (@SmithInAfrica) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SmithInAfrica/statuses/440748142649024512\">March 4, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53157f35e4b0984a90a9e0b1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-04T07:23:57.619Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here are yesterday’s key events:</p><h2>Summary</h2><p><b>• A witness told the trial that she heard “bloodcurdling screams” on the night the Paralympian shot his girlfriend dead.</b></p><p><b>• The witness, Michelle Burger, told the court she heard two people - a man and a woman - shouting</b><b>, adding: </b><b>“The fear in that woman’s voice; you only fear like that if your life is threatened.”</b></p><p><b>• Burger said she heard four gunshots on the night in question.<br></b></p><p><b>• Pistorius pleaded not guilty to the murder and to firearms charges, telling the court he denied the allegations of murder “in the strongest terms” and believed an intruder had broken into his house and was in his bathroom when he fired.<br></b></p><p><b>• Pistorius said he approached the bathroom with a gun in an effort to protect Steenkamp and accused the prosecution of once again using “unsubstantiated allegations” to argue that he murdered Steenkamp.</b></p><p><b>• The Paralympian also accused the prosecution of trying to use inadmissible evidence for the “assassination of my character” and said that suggestions he deliberately killed Steenkamp “could not be further from the truth”.</b></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53157e2fe4b0da1677ed2caf\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-04T07:23:57.619Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the second day of the trial of Oscar Pistorius, who is accused of murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on 14 February last year.

only fear like that if your life is threatened.”</b></p><p><b>• Burger said she heard four gunshots on the night in question.<br></b></p><p><b>• Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to the murder and to firearms charges, telling the court he denies the allegations of murder “in the strongest terms” and believed an intruder had broken into his house and was in his bathroom when he fired.<br></b></p><p><b>• Pistorius says he approached the bathroom with a gun in an effort to protect Steenkamp and has accused the prosecution of once again using “unsubstantiated allegations” to argue that he murdered Steenkamp.</b></p><p><b>• The Paralympian has also accused the prosecution of trying to use inadmissible evidence for the “assassination of my character” and said that suggestions he deliberately killed Steenkamp “could not be further from the truth”.</b></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T14:10:13.726Z\">at 2.10pm

Masipa became a social worker after leaving school in 1976, and <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2014-02-18-experienced-reserved-judge-for-pistorius-trial\">only completed her law degree at 43</a>. In 1998 she became the second black woman on the Transvaal bench, and has spoken out strongly about violence against women in her judgments and twice handed down maximum sentences to men convicted of such crimes. <br><br>One was in 2009 against Freddy Mashamba, a police officer who shot and killed his former wife after a row over their divorce settlement. “No one is above the law,” Masipa said. “You deserve to go to jail for life because you are not a protector. You are a killer.”<br><br><p>The second was in May 2013 against Shepherd Moyo, a serial rapist and burglar whose<a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/so-long-axeman-1.1138152\"> sentence of 252 years</a> was intended to serve as a deterrent, she said. “The worst [thing] in my view is that he attacked and raped the victims in the sanctity of their own homes where they thought they were safe.”</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T09:35:09.772Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-53143a79e4b0149dfe8e3963\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T08:18:30.269Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here’s a bit more detail and background from the Press Association.</p><p>Pistorius, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and dark tie, was ambushed by cameras as he made his way through the building to the courtroom. Crowds of media gathered outside the court for the case, which has attracted global attention. </p><p>The trial is expected to hear from more than 100 witnesses, including neighbours who claim to have heard screams from his house that night, as well as former girlfriends of the athlete. Parts of the proceedings will be broadcast live, and in South Africa a 24-hour channel will cover the trial and commentary around it. <br></p><p>Today is thought to be the first time Pistorius will come face to face with Steenkamp’s mother, June, who is attending the trial. <br></p><p>The sporting star’s case will be decided by a judge assisted by two “assessors”, but no jury. The mandatory sentence for someone convicted of premeditated murder in South Africa is life with a minimum of 25 years in prison, meaning if Pistorius is found guilty he will be over 50 when he is released. <br></p><p>The paralympian is accused of the premeditated murder of Steenkamp, who died of multiple gunshot wounds. Prosecutors allege Pistorius shot her four times through the locked bathroom door at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of 14 February 2013. <br></p><p>Some witnesses have described hearing a woman scream, followed by “moments of silence”, then hearing gunshots followed by more screaming. <br></p><p>Pistorius claims he thought an intruder was in his home, but prosecutors say that even so, an “error in persona” did not affect the fact he intended to kill someone. <br></p><p>Some 107 witnesses are listed by the state, including Steenkamp’s close friends Desiree, Gina and Kim Myers, as well as Pistorius’s sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold. <br><br></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b057a507-ac2e-492b-ae01-e39ec9c4d7e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/3/1393839873956/4749f3a3-dbd1-409e-83b0-b7ac207fd1e0-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Oscar Pistorius looks at his watch as the start of his trial is delayed\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Oscar Pistorius looks at his watch as the start of his trial is delayed.

Another went somewhat further: \"It is very hard now, after years of form … not to come to the conclusion that Vincent Nichols is in fact a fifth columnist on a mission to undermine and if it were possible, even destroy Catholicism as we know it.\"</p><p>Then, at the end of last year, Nichols weighed in once more, describing the government's pursuit of immigration targets as \"inhumane\", and warning that the rules preventing the foreign spouses of UK citizens settling in the country risked undermining marriages and splitting up families.</p><p>But it is the 68-year-old cardinal-designate's recent interview with the Telegraph – which ran exactly a week before he is due to be created a prince of the church in Rome – that has seized the headlines and helped fix him in the public and political consciousness. It also elicited a fantastically sniffy response from a source close to the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, who told the paper: \"He's entitled to his own opinion but there are some parts where he is just wrong …\"</p><p>Yesterday, he returned to the theme, saying he had been inundated with messages of support after highlighting the consequences of the government's welfare reforms. He said it was his \"privilege to put them into the public arena\".</p><p>Nichols's sense of acting as a privileged megaphone for the meek and the mute, the marginalised and the victimised, is likely only to be enhanced by his impending promotion.</p><p>\"Being a cardinal will be a help to him because he'll have a more authoritative voice: a cardinal is close to other cardinals and close to the pope,\" says Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, his predecessor as archbishop of Westminster.</p><p>\"I think we'll have to wait and see but he's already spoken out on many things. Being a cardinal gives him – I was going to say better media space – [the chance] to speak out on matters that concern the church and society.\"</p><p>At a pre-consistory press conference at Archbishop's House behind Westminster cathedral yesterday, Nichols was happy to elaborate on two other goals: to stop politicians stirring fears over the effects of immigration and to ensure that the business community realises it is part of a wider society.</p><p>An early morning tube journey or a visit to an NHS hospital, reflected Nichols in his soft, Merseyside tones, offered ample proof of the contribution made by immigrant communities to the UK.</p><p>\"I think the idea that immigrants are a net drain on our resources is false,\" he said. \"We should not have a discourse about immigration which is based on fear. And I think it's – quite frankly – a lack of political leadership if we fashion a debate around fear.\"</p><p>Businesses, he went on, had a similar duty to act sensibly and responsibly and to understand that they operated \"almost by way of a mutual consent\" with society.</p><p>\"It's not enough for a business to ask, 'Is this legal? Is it profitable? Then we'll do it',\" he said.</p><p>\"Its sense of purpose must be to see itself located as an important player and contributor to a wider society … Good businesses know that a business will not survive in a broken society, so some business leaders actually speak the language that it is part of their role to help repair society.\"</p><p>Nichols, who was born in Crosby, Merseyside, in 1945, studied for the priesthood in Rome and was ordained a priest in December 1969. He was appointed general secretary of the bishops' conference in England and Wales in 1984, became auxiliary bishop to Westminster aged just 46 in 1992, and was promoted to archbishop of Birmingham eight years later.</p><p>Catherine Pepinster, editor of the Catholic weekly the Tablet, feels that Nichols has been re-energised of late. Perhaps it is the fabled \"Pope Francis effect\", perhaps simply the confidence that comes with the acquisition of a red biretta. \"The Catholic church in this country has long been a church of migrants with its members coming in recent times from Poland, the Philippines and South America. He's hearing from parish priests how policies are affecting them, and he clearly believes it's his duty to be their voice,\" she said.</p><p>Murphy-O'Connor, who has known Nichols for 30 years, believes that the pope – the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina – will get on very well with the teachers' son from Merseyside. Both pride themselves on their simple lives and are devoted to their respective football teams, San Lorenzo and Liverpool.</p><p>As well as making Nichols a cardinal, says Murphy-O'Connor, Francis has also appointed him to the powerful congregation for bishops. The new pope recently revamped the congregation, removing the conservative US cardinal Raymond Burke – an outspoken opponent of abortion and gay marriage – in a move that one Vatican expert called a \"tectonic shift\" in governance.</p><p>\"I think that particular appointment, to that crucial congregation, is an indication that he wants to have Vincent Nichols's voice there,\" says Murphy-O'Connor. \"He has shaken up that particular congregation and brought other people on to it as well, whose voices he wants to hear, and who have a good influence on the bishops.\"</p><p>Mark Dowd, chair of LGBT Catholics Westminster, also feels that Nichols and Francis are kindred spirits. The latter's famous words to journalists on a plane back from Brazil – \"If someone is gay and seeks the Lord with good will, who am I to judge?\" – appear to chime harmoniously with the former's pastoral work.</p><p>Dowd says that Nichols's commitment to inclusivity has paid dividends under the leadership of the new pontiff.</p><p>\"Since Francis has come in – and because of all the stories of his words on the flight back from Brazil, the way he's engaged with letters sent directly to Rome and to the Vatican, and the way he's been engaging with individuals from LGBT communities – I think in a sense there's a very different kind of atmosphere around at the moment,\" he said.</p><p>\"To be honest, [Nichols] is in a very nice position now because of Pope Francis and because of a lot of the outreach and the risks he's taken in the past by being very positive and accommodating with us - particularly the famous \"hold their tongue\" interview; people will never forget that.\"But despite the liberal rapture that has greeted Francis's first year as pope, and despite Nichols's efforts to make the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales a more inclusive entity, the obvious fact remains that both men are at the very top of an institution that opposes abortion, same-sex marriage and the ordination of women as priests.</p><p>Nichols's task is to find a way to explain and defend his beliefs to a country that disagrees with many of them.</p><p>\"One challenge is to make sure that the Christian voice in this country is not privatised; that in its relationship with society, Christianity is free to say what it believes in and is not put on the periphery and privatised in the way that some people would rather like it to be,\" says Murphy-O'Connor. \"It's very important that the Christian voice in this country is heard and that we're free to do it.\"</p><p>What precise effect Nichols's red hat will have on the mind and mouth beneath it is anyone's guess.</p>","headline":"Vincent Nichols: enigmatic archbishop stepping into pope's inner circle","trailText":"<p>Nichols has shown he is not afraid to speak out when he feels compelled to do so</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392754945211/Vincent-Nichols-006.jpg","wordcount":"1538","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-21T20:23:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/vincent-nichols-archbishop-cardinal-profile","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/18/vincent-nichols-archbishop-cardinal-profile","tags":[{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catholicism","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/christianity","references":[]},{"id":"tone/profiles","webTitle":"Profiles","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/profiles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/profiles","references":[]},{"id":"profile/samjones","webTitle":"Sam Jones","rcsId":"GNL036708","r2ContributorId":"16394","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Jones is a reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/samjones","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/series/profile","webTitle":"The Guardian profile","type":"series","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/profile","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/series/profile","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-430151792","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392754934788/Vincent-Nichols-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Peter Macdiarmid","altText":"Vincent Nichols","height":"54","credit":"Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images","caption":"Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster.

They were joined by legions of dog owners displaced from their usual Thames-side walks by the river's rising waters who had decided to allow their pets to sniff around the gigantic, water-filled plastic tube and inspect the sad and sandbagged houses on either side.</p><p>The temporary dam, which was finally heaved into place by service personnel from the 2nd Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles and the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment on Saturday, has not been slow to acquire a nickname – or to become a celebrity in its own right. Less feted, but perhaps as important, are the smaller yellow tubes that run next to the sausage, pumping floodwater away from homes and back into the river.</p><p>\"We're really happy with the Chertsey Sausage,\" said Clare Murchison, a 45-year-old HR manager who lives in a close off Bridge road. \"The Manchester fire crews who brought the yellow pumps are saving the day.\" Although she was still trying to gauge the scale of the damage to her home – \"I can hear the water under the floorboards and I can smell it\" – Murchison was delighted that help had arrived and that people were pulling together. \"I'm so proud to live in Chertsey because of the community spirit,\" she said. \"When it happened, I thought, 'I can't be here any more', but it's brought out the best in most people.\"</p><p>Not everyone in the Surrey town, however, welcomes the dam.</p><p>Some of those who live on Bridge road are less concerned with the Chertsey Sausage's sudden fame than its effectiveness. The Environment Agency (EA), which brought in the £90,000 US-made dam, claims it will stop the floodwaters reaching a further 200 homes on the south side of the street. But for those who live on the other side of the road, and whose homes back on to the river, it is too little, too late. They feel their properties, which have already been flooded, are being abandoned to the waters and fear they could find themselves trapped.</p><p>The EA said it put the dam on the road rather than behind the flooded houses as it provides a flat surface.</p><p>Hannah Rushe, whose ground floor was left under six inches of water last week, believes her home and those of her neighbours are being deliberately sacrificed to save a nearby fuel depot that supplies Heathrow airport.</p><p>\"An Environment Agency guy actually told me that [the dam] is there to save 200 other houses, but&nbsp;... it doesn't make sense to save 200 houses – if it was for national importance, you could understand it.\"</p><p>Rushe, 38, said the situation was giving her panic attacks and was stopping her sleeping. Worried by the prospect of being trapped by the dam if there are further floods, she has moved in with her mother. \"If it does flood down here again, they won't even be able to get a boat through,\" she said. \"All my neighbours are still here but I can't physically stay because I've got mould on all the walls. It's been horrendous and none of the politicians want to know.\"</p><p>Almost as bad, she added, were the overflowing bins and attendant rodents. \"My neighbours saw rats on their conservatory roof the other day, trying to keep dry. That's not a good environmental thing, is it?\"</p><p>The EA denied priority was being given to the fuel depot or to a nearby water treatment plant, adding it was not true that some properties were being sacrificed in favour of others. A spokesman said the dam was in Chertsey to halt the waters before they could damage more houses on Bridge road.</p><p>\"We're expecting a peak in water levels on Tuesday and Wednesday, so it will be there until at least then,\" he said.</p><p>Despite the EA's assurances that the dam was unlikely to make things worse for those on the north side of Bridge road, Jonny Ritchie, a 23-year-old physiotherapist who lives with his parents  next to Hannah Rushe, was sceptical. The army had done a good job of protecting people's homes with sandbags, he said, but the overall response has been \"pretty poor\". \"Some people think the sausage is a PR stunt. It may look good on the news, but the sausage isn't doing anything.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 17 February, 2014.

The postmark on one of the packages was from the Republic of Ireland and there were a couple of similar incidents late last year.</p><p>The news prompted David Cameron to chair a meeting of the government's Cobra committee. No details were released of attendees at Thursday's meeting, but it is likely that they included intelligence chiefs as well as government officials and senior police officers.</p><p>A Number 10 spokeswoman said: \"Seven suspect packages have been identified as containing small, crude, but potentially viable devices bearing the hallmarks of Northern Ireland-related terrorism  … These have now been safely dealt with by the police and bomb disposal units. Guidance has been issued to staff at all military establishments and Royal Mail asking them to be extra vigilant and to look out for any suspect packages, and the screening procedures for mail to armed forces careers offices are being reviewed. The national threat level remains under constant review.\"</p><p>The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, told LBC Radio: \"It's a long while since we've seen Northern Ireland-related terrorist activity on the mainland, but of course for those living in Northern Ireland, this problem hasn't gone away and there has been a continuing drum beat, albeit of course at a much lower level than it was in the past, but a continuing drum beat of activity from dissident Republican organisations.</p><p>\"I can assure you we haven't taken our eye off the ball. Northern Ireland remains very high on our list of security priorities and the various security authorities are very conscious of the fact that there is a continuing terrorist threat from dissident Republican organisations and that it could spill over into the UK mainland and we keep a very close watch on that.\"</p><p>The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Ivan Lewis, said: \"These devices bear the hallmarks of another attempt by dissidents to reverse the progress we have seen in Northern Ireland over the past 15 years. Their attempt to harm innocent people will be condemned by the people of Northern Ireland, including by those they claim to represent.\"</p><p>Stormont deputy first minister Martin McGuinness condemned those who continued to engage in violence. Details of the packages emerged hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a residential area of Newry in Northern Ireland. No one was injured in the blast.</p><p>Commenting on both incidents on Twitter, Sinn Fein's McGuinness said pipe bombs and letter bombs were an \"attack on the peace process\". He said: \"Those responsible belong to the past. Their futile acts must be condemned.\"</p><p>As a result of the discovery of the packages, Queensmere shopping centre in Slough, Berkshire, was evacuated  on Thursday, and St Giles, a busy street in central Oxford, was closed. Kent police said a cordon had been put in place on St Peter's Street in Canterbury.</p><p>Sussex police said a bomb disposal team had been called in after a suspicious package was reported in Queen's Road, Brighton, at 10.40am. The road was sealed off and nearby streets were also closed.</p><p>The south-east counter-terrorism unit (Sectu) – which covers Thames Valley, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent – confirmed that suspect packages had been received at seven army careers offices. \"The contents of the packages are suspicious in nature and will now be sent off for forensic examination,\" said Det Supt Stan Gilmour of Sectu.</p><p>He added: \"When a suspect package is reported we have a routine response, which means we may need to evacuate the area if necessary until we can be sure it poses no threat to the public.</p><p>\"While this can cause concern and disruption for local communities, it is a necessary precaution until we know what we are dealing with.\"</p><p>A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said security advice to service personnel had been reiterated, adding: \"We can confirm that we are aware of security incidents ongoing in Oxford, Slough and Brighton involving armed forces careers offices.</p><p>\"The relevant police authorities are investigating with military EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] teams in support.\"</p><p>A security alert at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk – sparked following a routine vehicle search at the base  on Thursday morning – is understood to have been a false alarm and not related to the investigation at the armed forces recruitment offices.</p><p>A spokesman for  one of the US Air Force squadrons based at RAF Mildenhall said a package had been discovered in a vehicle entering the facility just before 8.30am. As a result the main gate to the base was closed until 11am.</p><p>Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Parker, commander of the US 100th Civil Engineer Squadron, said: \"The gate was closed at approximately 8.24am after 100th Security Forces Squadron personnel found a suspicious package during a routine vehicle inspection.</p><p>\"The 100th Security Forces Squadron, Ministry of Defence and British Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel worked together to clear the scene, and they have certified it is now safe.\"</p>","headline":"Crude explosive devices sent to UK army careers

Poor communities are least equipped to deal with the impacts.\"</p><p>Steven Croft, the bishop of Sheffield, described the threat of climate change as \"a giant evil; a great demon of our day\", adding: \"Its power is fed by greed, blindness and complacency in the present generation, and we know that this giant wreaks havoc though the immense power of the weather systems, which are themselves unpredictable.\"</p><p>He said the church had a \"critical role\" to play in lobbying politicians on climate change in order to bring about manifesto commitments to reach the target of an 80% reduction in UK greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p><p>The church's renewed commitment to tackling climate change was welcomed by Christian charities.</p><p>\"Climate change is increasingly becoming one of the moral issues of our time and the church has a powerful voice with which to speak,\" said Christian Aid's senior climate change adviser, Dr Alison Doig.</p><p>\"The next 18 months will significantly shape the politics of climate change with the UN global deal on emissions expected in Paris next year and the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report next month. The church can now engage prophetically on this subject and speak with a united voice for those suffering both here and abroad.\"</p><p>Paul Cook, advocacy director of Tearfund, said the current flood in Britain were serving as a wake-up call to the church.</p><p>\"The climate really is changing, and it's happening now,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's not just a problem for our grandchildren, it's not just

That will mean different ways of working at every level of the church in practice, in the way our meetings are structured, presented and lived out in every form of appointment.\"</p><p>Welby will say it is vital that \"huge discipline\" is exercised when making new appointments, suggesting he is keen to ensure that those who have opposed the creation of female bishops do not feel alienated or passed over.</p><p>Members of the Church of England's governing body voted on Tuesday to move to rescind the Episcopal Ministry Act of Synod 1993, which helped to hold the church together by providing so-called \"flying bishops\" to look after parishes that rejected women priests, but angered those who saw it as unfair and discriminatory.</p><p>They also voted, by a margin of 358 to 39, in favour of halving the six-month consultation period over the new legislation so that dioceses' responses would be ready for consideration at the next synod meeting in July. Nine synod members abstained.</p><p>Under the measures – which won overwhelming support at the last synod meeting three months ago – female bishops would be introduced with a house of bishops \"declaration\" setting out guidance for parishes where congregations reject female bishops.</p><p>The plans would see the creation of an ombudsman, appointed by the archbishops and with the backing of lay and clergy representatives in the synod, who would rule on disputes once female bishops are in place. Clergy who fail to co-operate with the ombudsman could be subject to disciplinary proceedings.</p><p>Now that the package has cleared the revision stage – and if it is given final approval when the synod meets in July – the legislation could come into force by November and a female bishop could be chosen in December.</p><p>In his speech, Welby will also say: \"We all know that perfect love casts out fear ... We know it although we don't often apply it. We mostly know that perfect fear casts out love. In any institution or organisation, the moment that suspicion reigns and the assumption that everything is zero sum becomes dominant – that is to say that someone else's gain must be my loss; we can't both flourish – that institution will be increasingly dominated by fear.\"</p><p>Despite acknowledging that the Church of England is not \"tidy, nor efficiently hierarchical\", the archbishop will stress the need for unity, co-operation and caution as it nears the end of its two-decade standoff over bringing women into the episcopate.</p><p>The bishop of Rochester, James Langstaff, who chaired the steering committee that came up with the new package, said he hoped the new deal would meet with final approval in July, but he was \"not in the business of counting chickens\", especially after the disastrous vote of November 2012, which saw moves to introduce women bishops defeated by just six votes.</p><p>\"We are hopeful that the different shape of the process we are running will lead to final approval, otherwise we would not be taking it through to that stage,\" he said.</p><p>\"But until the votes are actually counted it would be premature to assume it's going through.\"</p>","headline":"Justin Welby to Anglicans: abandon old fears and welcome female bishops","trailText":"Archbishop of Canterbury to urge his followers to find new ways of working together in

I would rather stay the way I am'.\"</p><p>Twenty years ago this April, Masereka, a Rwandan Tutsi who dreamed of becoming a nurse, watched neighbour turn on neighbour as the country's Hutu majority embarked on a three-month campaign of systematic slaughter, during which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were murdered.</p><p>Although tensions and violence between the two groups were common, the shooting down of a plane carrying the Rwandan president, Juvénal Habyarimana, on 6 April 1994 triggered a killing frenzy that was unprecedented in scale and ferocity.</p><p>\"Before then, they used to kill quietly; after that it became open,\" says Masereka. \"I started hearing gunshots, people screaming, homes being burnt. Very early in the morning, I could see many people running in both directions: running, screaming, children crying.\"</p><p>Her father, a Seventh Day Adventist pastor who had lived through the Rwandan revolution that preceded the country's independence from Belgium, called his children together and told them: \"All I can say is go find refuge, go find where to hide, but wherever you'll be, keep praying. If we happen to meet, we'll pray together.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428068889'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/26/1390745714766/Sophie-Musabe-Masereka-a--011.jpg' alt='Sophie Musabe Masereka, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sophie Musabe Masereka lost her father, two brothers and a niece in the Rwandan genocide but survived herself  thanks to a misfiring gun. Photograph: Sean Smith for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>They were not all to meet again. Five days later, Masereka watched as one of her brothers was taken to the side of the road and shot. After hiding in bushes, where she was bitten by a snake, she decided to return to her family, only to find them being lined up next to one of the newly dug pits that had appeared near Tutsi homes. Her younger brother tried to shoo her away. \"He told me: 'Go! We are going to be killed. We don't want you to die with us'.\"</p><p>His warning saved her life. Ten years ago, she gathered her brother's bones and those of her father and niece from the pit and washed them.</p><p>The closest of Masereka's many subsequent escapes came when she was picked up at a roadblock and told she would be shot. For some reason, the bullet that should have hit her fell from the barrel of the gun on to the floor.</p><p>Masereka believes it was God who brought about her escape; the brother who was with her at the time insists her life was spared because he paid the soldiers a bribe of 20p.</p><p>With the help of a neighbour, she managed to get to a cathedral in Kigali where 1,500 people were hiding. The number of sanctuary-seekers gradually diminished as Hutus arrived to take small groups out to be murdered.</p><p>After a while, they tired of the slow pace and told those inside that they would be back the next day with grenades. Once again, her luck held: rebels arrived that night to rescue Masereka and others.</p><p>Two decades on, her memories are as fresh as her grief. \"Every day, I find a way to say my people's names,\" she says. \"When I'm on the bus sometimes, I remember them and tears come to my eyes.\"</p><p>Sokphal Din's memories, grief and anger are equally vivid. He was 18 when the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh, dragged his family out of their house in the Cambodian capital and drove them into the killing fields, where, one by one, he watched them die of hunger, exhaustion and malaria. For four years they lived in the jungle as Pol Pot set about murdering 1.7 million people.</p><p>\"It was like living in the dark ages,\" says Din. \"They called it Year Zero. There was no contact with the outside world. From time to time they forced us to move around like cattle. They kept doing that until we were completely tired and some died from starvation or disease.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428068886'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/26/1390746674423/A-tourist-walks-past-port-011.jpg' alt='A tourist walks past portraits of Khmer Rouge victims at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, Phnom Penh' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pictures of victims of the Khmer Rouge at the Tuol Sleng genocide museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Photograph: Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>With no more sustenance than a daily spoon of rice, he began to find himself obsessed with food – and death. \"We closed our eyes every night and dreamed about food; about chicken. But as I was about to eat it, I woke up. Then I'd try to go back to sleep again to continue the dream, and think: 'Please let me finish that chicken'.\"</p><p>His grandmother, whose ashes he still carries, died in his arms in the killing fields. His four-year-old brother was the next to die, succumbing to malaria after trying to fish for shrimp. As he watched his aunt perish and then his cousins, Din felt a monstrous envy.</p><p>\"I looked at them and I thought: 'You are so lucky! You're dying now. You're going now, you're not suffering any more. I am the one who's still alive here and I don't know what's going to happen to me'.\"</p><p>He was freed in 1979 after the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. After living in a refugee camp and two years as a Buddhist monk, he came to the UK in 1987. Din still dreams, almost every night, of those four years, and of the opportunities denied him by the Khmer Rouge.</p><p>\"They took away my future; my dream of becoming something,\" he says. \"I wanted to be a doctor. They took away my family and all my good memories of my family. They took away my property. I would have been happy if the killing fields hadn't happened. I would have a lot of children – a family around me – and we'd all be happy.\"</p><p>Thirty-two years before Din was forced into a life of exile and hard labour, Freddie Knoller, a Viennese Jew, was put aboard a train bound for Auschwitz.</p><p>\"The trains had 10 wagons and 100 people squeezed into each one,\" he says. \"It was impossible to be comfortable there, but we organised ourselves: we got the old men, the women and the babies and the children who were there to sit or to lean against the wall.\"</p><p>Although Knoller and the other young people in the wagon took it in turns to sit and stand, their efforts proved insufficient. By the time the train pulled in to the camp, one child and three of the older people were dead.</p><p>On arrival, he was given a uniform and had the number 157108 tattooed on his left arm. As his head was being shaved, he heard, for the first time, about old people and women being taken to Birkenau to be gassed and cremated.</p><p>\"We didn't believe what they were saying because it was ridiculous. Germany was supposedly a cultured country. We couldn't believe it, but then they said: 'You will smell the sweet smell in the air of the burning bodies quite soon.' And really quite soon we smelled it and we started to believe that what they were saying was really true.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428068890'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/26/1390746298658/A-group-of-children-in-st-011.jpg' alt='A group of children in striped concentration camp uniforms behind barbed wire fencing at Auschwitz' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Children at the Auschwitz concentration camp just after it was liberated by the Soviet army on January 27 1945 – the date now commemorated as Holocaust Memorial Day. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>Despite meagre food and the back-breaking work of carrying 25kg bags of cement to the nearby IG Farben chemical factory, Knoller survived not only Auschwitz but also its death-march evacuation as the Russians approached in January 1945.</p><p>In Bergen-Belsen – where prisoners went without food for a month – he dug the ground in search of roots to eat. Others went to more desperate lengths.</p><p>\"The ground was full of dead people and I saw with my own eyes young people finding sharp stones and cutting up the flesh of the dead bodies to roast over fire,\" he says. \"There was no more discipline.\"</p><p>Knoller did not join them in either their cannibalism or their despair. From the moment he was captured by the Gestapo in France in 1943 until the day Bergen-Belsen was liberated by the British in April 1945, he refused to surrender his hope or his faith.</p><p>\"I saw in the camps so many prisoners who were pessimists,\" he said. \"They gave in; they gave up; they didn't fight for their lives, but I did fight. I believed in God and I still believe in God because I feel if I am in trouble, I can go back and beg God: 'Get me out of here'.\"</p><p>Today, at the age of 92, Knoller makes weekly visits to schools to tell students about the Holocaust. Din and Masereka, who also work with the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to raise awareness of genocide, want the world to know what happened to them in the hope that others will be spared similar horrors.</p><p>Din is writing a book about his time in the killing fields between shifts on the checkout of a Sainsbury's in Hampshire and his work as an interpreter.</p><p>\"I want people to learn from the past and move on and do right,\" says Masereka. \"Who are we to destroy somebody's life?\"</p><p>In the end, she found herself unable to keep the promise she made as a 22-year-old: Masereka is married, has three children and works as a nurse.</p>","headline":"Genocide survivors speak of horrors of the Holocaust, Cambodia and Rwanda","trailText":"On Holocaust Memorial Day Freddie Knoller,

on list of 16 new 'princes of the church' eligible to vote for future popes","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, is to become a cardinal after Pope Francis included him on a list of 16 new \"princes of the church\" eligible to vote in papal conclaves.</p><p>At a ceremony known as a consistory on 22 February, the Argentinian pontiff will create his first batch of cardinals who, clad in their distinctive red hats, represent the highest ranks of the Roman Catholic clergy. Several of the other new cardinals are from developing countries.</p><p>Sixteen of the prelates Francis named on Sunday are under 80 and therefore young enough to be able to take part in the election of his successor. The pope also announced he was promoting three older men to the rank of cardinal, but they will not be able to vote in conclaves.</p><p>Speaking from his studio window to pilgrims in St Peter's Square after the Sunday angelus, or blessing, Francis read out the list of 19 men, aged from 55 to 98, whom he had selected.</p><p>Coming from 12 countries from \"every part of the world\", he said, the 16 cardinal electors \"represent the deep ecclesial relationship between the church of Rome and the other churches throughout the world\".</p><p>In what appeared to be a delicate balancing act between Vatican convention and Francis's spirit of innovation, the pope included four senior figures from the Roman curia on the list: his secretary of state, Pietro Parolin; Gerhard Ludwig Müller, prefect of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith (CDF); Lorenzo Baldisseri, secretary general of the synod of bishops; and Beniamino Stella, prefect of the congregation for the clergy.</p><p>But, in keeping with his desire to rebalance church governance and steer the institution away from being overly Vatican-centric, Francis ensured the remaining 12 cardinal electors were archbishops or bishops based around the world, from Canada to Korea.</p><p>Central and South America was the region best represented, with Nicaragua, Haiti, Brazil, Chile and Argentina each producing a cardinal-elect. It had been considered almost inevitable that the pope's successor as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Mario Aurelio Poli, would be named.</p><p>But others, such as Jean-Pierre Kutwa, archbishop of Abidjan in Ivory Coast, were more unexpected, and could be seen as reflecting the other major concern of Francis's 10 month-old pontificate: the poor.</p><p>Nichols's elevation comes almost a year after British Catholics found themselves with no cardinal taking part in the papal election prompted by Benedict XVI's resignation. Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the archbishop emeritus of Westminster, had already celebrated his 80th birthday, while Keith O'Brien, the Scottish cardinal and archbishop emeritus of St Andrews and Edinburgh, resigned in February following allegations of \"inappropriate acts\" involving junior priests, and said he would not go to Rome for the conclave.</p><p>Nichols, 68, said he was deeply moved by the \"humbling\" honour. \"The Catholic church in our countries has always had a profound and loving loyalty to the Holy Father, the successor of Saint Peter. This appointment enables me, on behalf of all, to serve the pope in a direct and prolonged way,\" he said.</p><p>\"I seek the blessing of Almighty God for these new responsibilities and I ask for the prayers of all people of faith that I may fulfil them with energy and devotion.\"</p><p>His inclusion had been predicted by many – not only because of convention but also because of a pastoral record likely to chime with a pope who wants a church that goes \"out on the streets\".</p><p>Despite the immutable nature of church teaching on homosexuality and his own criticisms of the government's gay marriage plans, Nichols's outspoken defence of fortnightly masses for gay, lesbian and transgender Roman Catholics won him gratitude and respect.</p><p>The Soho masses ended a year ago, reputedly because of pressure from the Vatican and an outcry from traditionalist British Catholics who disapproved of what they saw as a celebration of homosexuality.</p><p>For six years, however, they were a fixture – and staunchly defended by the archbishop. In 2010, Nichols laid into critics of the Soho masses, saying: \"Anybody from the outside who is trying to cast a judgment on the people who come forward for communion really ought to learn to hold their tongue.\"</p><p>It was a sentiment echoed by Pope Francis, who last year declared: \"If someone is gay and seeks the Lord with good will, who am I to judge?\"</p><p>It had been rumoured that Müller, one of Nichols's fellow cardinal-elects who was appointed prefect of the CDF in July 2012, had been keen to stop the masses and clamp down on any perceived challenges to Rome's authority.</p><p>When he announced the end of the masses, Nichols stressed that the church's \"teaching on matters of sexual morality\" remained unaltered despite recent legal and social changes surrounding \"same-sex attraction\".</p><p>But he has also hinted that the church could find itself forced to show more flexibility when it comes to its treatment of same-sex unions. Asked in a BBC interview whether the Roman Catholic church might eventually find itself imitating the Church of England – some of whose vicars have unofficially blessed gay unions for years, he replied: \"I don't know. Who knows what's down the road?\"</p><p>According to Austen Ivereigh, ex-director of public affairs for Murphy-O'Connor and co-ordinator of Catholic Voices, Nichols's commitment to a more inclusive church closely resembles that of the pope. \"If anything, I think Francis would be extremely sympathetic to the Soho masses,\" he said.</p><p>\"Francis likes pastoral bishops; he likes bishops with the smell of sheep and Vincent is a very experienced pastoral bishop and has a very pastoral approach to the sacraments – as he demonstrated with his open-door policy in the church, which I think is very much in the mould of Francis.\"</p>","headline":"Archbishop of Westminster is made a cardinal by Pope Francis","trailText":"Vincent Nichols is included on list of 16 new 'princes of the church' eligible to vote for future popes","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/12/1389545096934/Vincent-Nichols-006.jpg","wordcount":"931","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-15T16:45:55Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/12/archbishop-westminster-cardinal-pope-francis-vincent-nichols","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/12/archbishop-westminster-cardinal-pope-francis-vincent-nichols","tags":[{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/catholicism","references":[]},{"id":"world/pope-francis","webTitle":"Pope Francis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pope-francis","references":[]},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/christianity","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/the-papacy","webTitle":"The papacy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-papacy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/the-papacy","references":[]},{"id":"world/vatican","webTitle":"Vatican","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/vatican","references":[]},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/italy","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lizzydavies","webTitle":"Lizzy Davies","r2ContributorId":"25822","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Lizzy Davies is Rome correspondent for the Guardian.

The paper said \"French interests\" were \"targeted on a daily basis\".</p><p>Le Monde highlighted what it called \"techniques used to violate the secrets or simply the private life of French people\". The paper said: \"The agency has several collection methods. When certain French phone numbers are dialled, a signal is activated that triggers the automatic recording of certain conversations. This surveillance also recovered SMS and content based on keywords.\"</p><p>Such methods, it added, allowed the NSA to keep a systematic record of the history of each target's connections.

Also targeted was Alcatel-Lucent, a French-American telecoms company that employs more than 70,000 people and works in the sensitive sector of equipping communication networks.</p><p>One of the documents instructed analysts to draw not only from the electronic surveillance programme, but also from another initiative dubbed Upstream, which allows surveillance on undersea communications cables.</p><p>Le Monde said one document it consulted showed that between 8 February and 8 March 2013 the NSA collected, worldwide, 124.8bn telephone data items and 97.1bn computer data items. In Europe, only Germany and the UK exceeded France in terms of the numbers of interceptions.</p><p>Le Monde questioned why the French government had remained so discreet for months on the NSA question, compared with the tougher stance shown by Brazil and Germany.</p><p>In July Hollande threatened to suspend negotiations for a transatlantic free trade agreement after reports in the Guardian and Der Spiegel that the NSA spied on EU offices and European diplomatic missions in Washington and at the UN in New York.</p><p>\"We were warned in June [about the programme] and we reacted strongly but obviously we need to go further,\" Fabius said.
