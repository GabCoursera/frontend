The latest curbs came hours after an audio recording of a high-level security meeting was leaked on the video-sharing website.<br></p><p>According to Turkish media reports, the decision to block YouTube was taken by Turkey’s telecommunications authority (TİB) as a “precautionary administrative measure.” In February, Turkey passed a much criticised new internet law that allows the telecommunications regulator to block websites without a court order. Turkey previously banned YouTube in 2007, but lifted the ban three years later.</p><p>Social media users in Turkey were able to access the site using \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs) – which allow an anonymous connection to the web – or by changing the domain name settings (DNS) on computers and mobile devices.</p><p>\"We're seeing reports that some users are not able to access YouTube in Turkey. There is no technical issue on our side and we're looking into the situation,\" Google said in a statement emailed to the Guardian.</p><p>The move by the TIB came hours after an anonymous YouTube account posted a leaked audio recording allegedly of a confidential conversation between Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu, undersecretary of the foreign ministry Feridun Sinirlioglu and deputy chief of the general staff, Yasar Gürel, discussing possible military action in Syria.<br></p><p>A source at the prime minister's office told Reuters that the government had taken action against YouTube after the leak of the voice recordings created a \"national security issue\". The source said that Turkey was in talks with the video-sharing platform and may lift the ban if YouTube agreed to remove the content.</p><p>Several similarly incriminating recordings, allegedly showing massive government corruption and prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's direct influence on the media, have been leaked on social media in recent weeks. Erdogan has dismissed the allegations as lies and blackmail, accusing the opposition of trying to undermine the success of his Justice and Development party (AKP) ahead of critical local elections on Sunday.<br></p><p>Speaking at a campaign rally in Diyarbakir, Erdogan accused the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania, of being behind the leaks: “Pennsylvania commits treason. […] To publish this recording is villainous, cowardly and immoral. Who are you serving with the surveillance of such a meeting?”</p><p>A public statement published on the foreign ministry’s website called the leak “an act of espionage.” A local prosecutor’s office has meanwhile launched an investigation into the YouTube account.</p><p>The move against YouTube came after the TIB  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\">blocked access to Twitter on Friday</a>. That created outrage in Turkey, where social media is widely used, and a court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban\">overturned the block on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>Friday's Twitter block came hours after Erdoğan vowed on the campaign trail to get rid of Twitter. He said on Tuesday that the network \"was threatening national security\" and that it had refused to co-operate with the Turkish authorities.</p>","headline":"Turkey blocks YouTube amid 'national security' concerns","trailText":"Turkish PM's office claim voice recordings posted to video-sharing website created a 'national security issue' leading to ban","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937199007/badef62b-59c8-4d02-aabe-2370258f8a0a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"487","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T15:23:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/youtube","webTitle":"YouTube","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/youtube","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominic-rushe","webTitle":"Dominic Rushe","r2ContributorId":"41799","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156653419/doiminixrushe_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Rushe is the US business correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominic-rushe","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-ec11b5f6-39ce-4530-a108-ecaf71062f10","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937201348/badef62b-59c8-4d02-aabe-2370258f8a0a-68x68.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937201348/badef62b-59c8-4d02-aabe-2370258f8a0a-68x68.jpeg","source":"Reuters","photographer":"Osman Orsal","altText":"Youtube Turkey","height":"68","credit":"Osman Orsal/Reuters","caption":"A man tries to get connected to the youtube web site with his tablet at a cafe in Istanbul on Thursday.

The Turkish government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\" title=\"\">restricted access to the micro-blogging website</a>, and prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  indicated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/turkey-erdogan-facebook-youtube-ban-elections\" title=\"\">the ban could be extended further</a>, saying he would not \"leave this nation at the mercy of YouTube and Facebook\" and pledging to \"take the necessary steps in the strongest way\".</p><p>On Thursday, he appeared to follow up that threat as Turkish media reported that the country's telecommunications authority (TİB) had blocked YouTube as a \"precautionary administrative measure\". The latest curbs came hours after an audio recording of a high-level security meeting was leaked on the video-sharing website. Turkey previously banned YouTube in 2007, but lifted the ban three years later.</p><p>According to PEN, the Twitter ban currently remains in place despite an administrative court order on 26 March ordering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban\" title=\"\">its suspension pending a court judgment</a>.</p><p>Pamuk, who won the Nobel in 2006, not long after Turkish state prosecutors had charged him with \"insulting Turkishness\" for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/12/nobelprize.awardsandprizes\" title=\"\">remarks he made to an interviewer</a>, told the Guardian \"there were times in Turkey when free speech was equally bad … as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/turkey.youtube\" title=\"\">in 2008 when YouTube was closed</a>. But at that time we were at least hopeful about the future. Not now. The situation here is going from bad to worse, and even towards terrible.\"</p><p>Pamuk's translator Maureen Freely, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/maureen-freely-pen-friendship\" title=\"\">new president of English PEN</a>, added: \"The real worry, I think, is that Erdoğan now seems to have the power to do whatever he wishes, whenever he wishes. And that is why we're so concerned about what he'll do next, to silence dissenters and crush opposition wherever he sees it.\"</p><p>The signatories to the letter point to the fact that Turkey ranks 154th&nbsp;among 180 countries on the <a href=\"https://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php\" title=\"\">World Press Freedom Index</a>, saying that even today, \"translators, editors, publishers, poets and writers face criminal proceedings and even imprisonment for legitimate expression under a variety of legislative fetters\". <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org/turkey-focus-2013-muharrem-erbey\" title=\"\">PEN particularly highlighted the case of Muharrem Erbey</a>, a human rights lawyer and writer who was arrested in 2009, and who is currently in prison awaiting trial. PEN believes the charges against the author are politically motivated, and that Erbey is being held because of his alleged affiliation with Kurdish political parties. The free speech organisation is calling for his immediate release.</p><p>In their letter, the writers – from Turkey and around the world – are asking Turkey's leaders \"not to retreat from democracy and its keystone, freedom of speech; but rather to recognise their obligations under international treaties and to lift the block on Twitter with immediate effect\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433193842'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2011/2/17/1297959958419/Cif-Elif-Shafak-007.jpg' alt='Cif: Elif Shafak' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'Democracy in Turkey is sorely lacking' … Turkish writer Elif Shafak was tried for 'insulting Turkishness'</figcaption></figure><p>\"We urge them to remember that this beautiful country will be stronger and happier when, and if, it appreciates pluralism, diversity and the freedom of words,\" they write. \"We welcome the administrative court in Ankara's decision to suspend the [Twitter] ban ahead of a full judgment and urge the telecommunications authority to restore access to Twitter immediately.\"</p><p>The Turkish author Elif Shafak, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/21/turkey.world\" title=\"\">who was also tried for \"insulting Turkishness\"</a> following the publication of her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/29/fiction.features1\" title=\"\">The Bastard of Istanbul</a>, is one of the authors to sign the letter. \"Turkey's rulers need to understand that democracy is not solely about getting a majority of votes in the ballot box. Far beyond that, democracy is a culture of inclusiveness, openness, human rights and freedom of speech, for each and every one, regardless of whichever party they might have voted for. It is the realisation of the very core of democracy that has been sorely lacking in Turkey today,\" said Shafak, whose trial – based on words uttered by fictional characters in her novel – went on for a year before charges were dropped.</p><p>The letter comes in the wake of a <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/turkey-end-human-rights-violations-against-writers-and-journalists\" title=\"\">new report from PEN International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org\" title=\"\">English PEN</a> on the Gezi Park protests last year, and their impact on freedom of expression. \"The excessive use of police force, as well as widespread media censorship and reprisals against journalists and users of social media, starkly illustrated the shortcomings of Turkish democracy in its lack of pluralism and disregard for fundamental rights and freedoms,\" says the report. It also lists the \"human rights violations\" that took place during the protests and calls on the Turkish government to, among other things, ensure freedom of expression is respected  and peaceful protestors are not \"arbitrarily detained\". PEN International and English PEN also wants the right to peaceful assembly included in Turkey's proposed new constitution.</p>","headline":"Turkey and Twitter: major authors join PEN International

We are united in our belief that freedom of expression is a universal and fundamental human right. We are gravely concerned about \"the freedom of words\" in Turkey. We connect both within and across borders through words, written and spoken. A free exchange of ideas is essential for democracy, as well as for creativity, empathy and tolerance. As revealed in a Pen report on last year's protests,Turkey has many freedom of expression issues, from criminal defamation to self-censorship within the mainstream media, to police violence against journalists and a narrowing of freedom of expression on the internet.</p><p>Turkey ranks 154th among 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index. Translators, editors, publishers, poets and writers face criminal proceedings and even imprisonment for legitimate expression, under a variety of legal fetters, including the country's draconian anti-terror law, the law on meetings and demonstrations and the Turkish penal code's articles on defamation (article 125), religious defamation (article 216), obscenity (article 226), insulting the Turkish people, state or its organs, and promoting conscientious objection to military service (article 318).</p><p>The blanket ban on Twitter and YouTube (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 27 March) comes in the aftermath of a regressive new internet law and is an unacceptable violation of the right to freedom of speech. With over 36 million internet users, Turkey should be proud to be home to Europe's youngest internet audience, placing it among the most globally connected countries in the Muslim world. By connecting people from a range of backgrounds and making it possible for them to express their thoughts, the internet is a valuable network that supports and strengthens democracy. Twitter and YouTube are vehicles of expression that give a voice to each and every user, regardless of class, religion, ethnicity or political stature. There are more than 12 million Twitter users in Turkey, which shows the vibrancy of civil society. Turkey is a state party to the European convention on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights, both of which protect the right to legitimate freedom of expression.</p><p>We welcome the administrative court in Ankara's decision to suspend the ban ahead of a full judgment and urge the telecommunications authority to restore access to Twitter immediately.</p><p>We are writers from Turkey and across the world. We care about one another's problems and we know that we are all interconnected. Turkey is a country where western democratic values, secularism and Islamic culture come together. It is not surrounded by enemies. It is not an isolated or inward-looking country. It is part of an international community. Our plea to Turkey's leaders is not to retreat from democracy and its keystone, freedom of speech; but rather to recognise their obligations under international treaties and to lift the block on Twitter and YouTube with immediate effect. We urge them to remember that this beautiful country will be stronger and happier when, and if, it appreciates pluralism, diversity and the freedom of words.<br /><strong>Héctor Abad

In response to allegations of mass corruption inside the government, Erdogan appears to have opted for a strategy of dividing the country into loyalists and traitors.

In the upper part of Okmeydani, predominantly housing the Alevi minority, countless graffiti slogans show the dominance of radical leftist groups. \"No entry to fascists\" and \"Berkin Elvan is immortal\", they read.</p><p>On the other side of the \"border\", the flags of rightwing, Islamist and conservative parties prevail. Graffiti proclaims \"Okmeydani will be a graveyard for communism\" and \"Martyrs never die\". Almost all the shops on the lively high street display posters mourning Karamanoglu.</p><p>Despite public pleas by both youths' fathers not to exploit their son's deaths for political purposes, Erdogan repeatedly lauded Karamanoglu as a martyr during campaign rallies, while calling 15-year-old Elvan, who was killed by a teargas capsule while going to buy bread, a terrorist.</p><p>A local shop owner said he was alarmed by the prime minister's comments: \"If you call one boy that was killed a terrorist, and another that was killed in the same neighbourhood a martyr, what do you think will happen?\" Does he feel forced to take sides? The man shakes his head, but adds that he is uncomfortable with the rising tension. \"There have not been any threats, but the psychological pressure is high. I have children, too, and I am afraid for them and their future.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees. In a shop a few yards up the street, the 46-year-old owner brushes off the concerns. \"I have lived here for over 30 years,\" he explains. \"We get along fine. There have been some tragic events, but we will not let that come between us.\"</p><p>At a nearby election rally for Kadir Topbas, the mayoral candidate of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), hundreds of supporters brandish Turkish flags, AKP scarves and posters of Karamanoglu. It is early afternoon, and the crowd consists predominantly of women.</p><p>\"We owe much to our prime minister,\" says a 42-year-old woman who wishes to remain anonymous. \"I still remember when I was not allowed to wear my headscarf, when I was humiliated for it. I remember rubbish in the streets. We didn't have running water.\"</p><p>A textile worker, 49, agrees that life has improved under the Erdogan government. \"Before there was crime, and the streets were dirty. There was nothing to buy in the store – no sugar, no cigarettes, nothing. Now we have everything in abundance. We also have peace, no more soldiers are dying.\" In his eyes, there is no viable alternative. \"If the [opposition Republican People's party] CHP would produce a good leader, we would vote for him. But we can't see anyone.\"</p><p>In another part of town some men from Okmeydani have joined the rally of the CHP mayoral candidate Mustafa Sarigül. They say that they feel threatened by the government's increasingly anti-Alevi stance.</p><p>Hamdi, 45, a musician, cites a planned urban renewal project as his biggest fear: \"If the AKP wins again, Okmeydani will be lost. It will simply disappear, with all the poor people in it. It will make way for big residences and the rich.\"</p><p>Referring to recent and repeated attacks on CHP election offices in the area, one man adds: \"But they will not win votes by attacking us with knives and sticks. They use religion to divide us, but that will not work either.\"</p><p>One local craftsman suggests that Erdogan's style of governing has become untenable for the country: \"In Turkey, we now have the situation that one half of the country loves the prime minister unconditionally whereas the other half not only does not vote for him, but truly hates him. One half of the country cannot stand to hear his voice, or see his face on posters, or on TV. How can you rule a country like that?\"</p>","headline":"Turkish PM divides nation and neighbourhoods ahead of local elections","trailText":"In one Istanbul district, armoured cars guard 'border' separating Erdogan loyalists and those backing the opposition","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395935011419/Supporters-of-Turkeys-pri-004.jpg","wordcount":"1018","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T14:57:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/turkish-pm-erdogan-divides-nation-local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/27/turkish-pm-erdogan-divides-nation-local-elections","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433145895","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395935006706/Supporters-of-Turkeys-pri-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Adem Altan","altText":"Supporters of Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayipp Erdogan, during an election rally in Ankara","height":"54","credit":"Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Supporters of Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayipp Erdogan, during an election rally in Ankara.

We might not like the court decision, but we will carry it out,\" he told reporters.</p><p>The microblogging site was blocked on Friday, only hours after Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vowed to \"eradicate\" Twitter in an election speech. The website has been used to disseminate a series of apparently incriminating audio recordings suggesting massive corruption inside the Turkish government.</p><p>The disruption, implemented only days before crucial local elections, sparked national and international outrage. EU officials, human rights organisations, the US government and the UN all expressed grave concern about Turkey's attempt to curb freedom of expression and the increasing authoritarian stance of the Turkish government.</p><p>Several complaints were filed contesting the ban, and Turkish bar associations harshly criticised the block as unlawful and unconstitutional.</p><p>Twitter on Wednesday said it had handed in petitions for lawsuits challenging the ban, while also starting to suspend content in compliance with Turkish court orders. According to the Turkish daily Hürriyet, the account @oyyokhirsize (\"no vote for the thief\") was not accessible anymore from Turkey. In a statement on the company's official blog, general counsel Vijaya Gadde confirmed Twitter had, for the first time in Turkey, used a tool to block access to an account accusing a former minister of corruption while it contested a court order to take it down.</p><p>The statement, which underlined that the company did not disclose any user data to the Turkish government, urged the immediate lifting of the ban: \"With all announced bases for the access ban addressed, there are no legal grounds for the blocking of our service in Turkey. Furthermore, with positive developments today concerning judicial review of this disproportionate and illegal administrative act of access banning the whole of Twitter, we expect the government to restore access to Twitter immediately so that its citizens can continue an open online dialogue ahead of the elections to be held at the end of this week.\"</p><p>Turkish officials have repeatedly defended the ban, accusing Twitter of ignoring Turkish court decisions to withdraw content considered to violate the right of privacy.</p><p>In a live TV interview on Tuesday, the prime minister also defended the government's Twitter block:  \"If the issues are not dealt with, we'll close the site down. If [Twitter] abides by the blockage [of certain accounts], we will lift the ban.\" And he added: \"We are not against the use of advanced technology, but unlawful use of it is not acceptable.\" In recent campaign speeches he has also hinted at a possible clampdown on popular websites such as YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>Turkey's justice minister, Bekir Bozdag, expressed scepticism concerning  Wednesday's court ruling: \"All the TIB is doing right now is to comply with court decisions. I wonder about the administrative court's reasoning. We will see how they came to the conclusion that an institution complying with a court order acts unconstitutionally.\"</p>","headline":"Turkish court lifts Twitter ban","trailText":"Deputy prime minister says Turkish government will accept court decision to lift ban on microblogging website","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395857165319/Last-week-Turkey-s-prime--006.jpg","wordcount":"550","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T18:07:19Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"media/blogging","webTitle":"Blogging","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/blogging","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/blogging","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433066770","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395857156467/Last-week-Turkey-s-prime--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"  ?ahan Nuho?lu/Demotix/Corbis","photographer":"?ahan Nuho?lu","altText":"Last week Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vowed to 'eradicate' Twitter","height":"54","credit":"?ahan Nuho?lu/  ?ahan Nuho?lu/Demotix/Corbis","caption":"Last week Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vowed to 'eradicate' Twitter.

The danger of armed clashes across mutual borders is rising too.</p><p>The incident also highlights the grim lesson that armed conflicts usually intensify when peace negotiations are on the agenda. All sides ramped up their offensives in the run-up to and during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/10/syrian-regime-and-opposition-begin-new-round-of-talks-in-geneva\" title=\"\">Geneva talks on Syria</a> in January and February, in the hope that military advances would give them stronger bargaining power. That&nbsp;lethal momentum has not slowed.</p><p>At the weekend western-supported rebels, along with their jihadist allies, the al-Nusra front, seemed to have captured Kasab – the last border crossing to Turkey still controlled by Bashar al-Assad's forces. The Syrian warplane's bombing runs were part of Assad's counter-attack. In nearby clashes on the ground the president's cousin, Hilal al-Assad – a&nbsp;leader of the National Defence Force militia – was killed on Sunday.</p><p>Elsewhere in the north, Syrian forces are slowly managing to capture rebel-held ground around the divided city of Aleppo, and might soon surround it. Meanwhile the US is stepping up its&nbsp;arms supplies to opposition fighters on the southern Jordanian front.</p><p>The government's indiscriminate artillery and air attacks on rebel parts of&nbsp;Aleppo, and the villages that lie north of it, have produced a huge surge of refugees. In the Turkish border town of&nbsp;Kilis, aid officials told me that a camp they help just inside Syria hosted 10,000 refugees at the beginning of this year. Now it hosts 50,000.</p><p>Turkey has shouldered an amazing burden, virtually without complaint. Kilis has a Turkish population of 80,000. Almost 40,000 Syrians now live there as well. Some are there because they are not given space in any of the three local camps. Others prefer a flat, at least until their funds for rent run out. Many are then forced to risk going back to Syria. At the border I approached four families at random. Two were returning to Aleppo. Abu Mohammed cradled a three-month-old baby in his arms. His burqa-clad wife stood a few yards off as he said: \"We left Aleppo four days ago because of fierce bombing night after night. We're thinking of going back because at least we have our own home and it's not yet destroyed.\"</p><p>Abu Omar was standing beside massive piles of suitcases, bulging black plastic bags and rolled up mattresses. His wife was sitting on one of the piles, their four children beside her. They had been in Kilis for four months, he said. Their home village of al-Bab recently fell under the control of fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (which is in constant conflict with other rebel groups), and&nbsp;they had heard that clashes were over and it was safe to return.</p><p>Syria's war is a strategic stalemate that no side can win, but the ebb and flow of the battlelines creates waves of misery that confront civilian families every day with the need to make life-and-death decisions about staying, moving or returning. The wrong choice can be fatal.</p><p>Hoping for a resumption of the Geneva talks seems futile, as the chief&nbsp;UN negotiator, Lakhdar Brahimi, acknowledged on Monday. The west's shrill and short-sighted reaction to Russia's takeover of Crimea has poisoned relations with the Kremlin and undermined any chance of US-Russian co-operation over Syria for several months at least. It will also have reinforced the Kremlin's determination not to see Assad toppled. Similarly, the west's refusal to invite Iran to join the Geneva process remains in force, and this only increases Tehran's support for Assad.</p><p>So the picture is bleaker by the day.

That rebel attack led to the killing of around 200 civilians, an act <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/10/10/syria-executions-hostage-taking-rebels\" title=\"\">labelled a war crime by Human Rights Watch</a> and other international observers.</p><p>Rebel groups, among them the jihadist Jabhat al-Nusra, say they are trying to reach the Mediterranean coast, where they hope to open a supply line, a difficult thing to achieve with the Syrian military maintaining dominance over air and sea.</p><p>Regime warplanes continued to bomb opposition positions on Tuesday, two days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/turkey-shoots-down-syrian-plane\" title=\"\">Turkey downed a Syrian jet which it claimed had flown into its air space</a> while on bombing runs near the border.</p><p>Syrian television reported on Tuesday that the pilot of the downed jet had been received on Monday as a hero in his home village near Hama, 60 miles south of the latest fighting.</p><p>The downing of the Syrian jet marked the third aerial clash between the two former allies since an uprising against Assad began in March 2011. Syria shot down a Turkish jet in 2012, and Turkey downed a Syrian helicopter last year. All three clashes have been in the same bitterly contested corner of the war ravaged country.</p><p>Opposition groups have mounted several offensives in northern Syria after ousting radical jihadist fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq in Sham (Isis) over three months of brutal battles.</p><p>Isis had maintained a stronghold in the northern Latakia region. Its influence spread across the countryside and into Aleppo, Syria's largest city. However, the recent battles have seen the group retreat to the town of al-Bab, just east of Aleppo, from where it controls much of eastern Syria and Anbar province in Iraq.</p><p>The opposition is now in control of the Kassab border crossing to Turkey, and the Armenian Christian town of the same name.</p><p>Attacks on the Alawite areas to the east have so far been sporadic; however, a cousin of the Syrian president, Hilal al-Assad, was killed on Sunday in a nearby village, apparently by a rebel rocket attack.</p><p>Assad led a local unit of the National Defence Front (NDF), a loyalist group drawn mainly from the Alawite sect, which is deployed in large numbers in the area. The NDF, the Syrian military, and an Iraqi militia, Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas, are also defending the area.</p><p>The renewed fighting in the north has been matched by relative quiet elsewhere in Syria. Battered forces from both sides appear to have drawn breath in Damascus and the south. And regime forces continue mopping-up operations in the Qalamoun mountains near Lebanon, where Hezbollah and regime troops last week succeeded in ousting opposition groups after more than four months of brutal fighting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, one of two main backers of the Syrian opposition, on Tuesday said the world had betrayed Syria's rebels. Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz said the Syrian crisis was a catastrophe, and called for \"changing the balance of forces\" on the ground.</p><p>A central driver of the war, which has killed in excess of 150,000 people and displaced up to nine million, is a battle for influence between Saudia Arabia and Iran, which has staunchly backed the Assad regime throughout the crisis.</p>","headline":"Bashar al-Assad's home village under threat from Syrian opposition forces","trailText":"Second sustained attack mounted on area around Qardaha, as government troops protect Syrian leader's ancestral village.","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395774478196/Clashes-in-Kasab-town-006.jpg","wordcount":"611","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T19:30:52Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/bashar-al-assad-home-village-syrian-opposition-attack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/25/bashar-al-assad-home-village-syrian-opposition-attack","tags":[{"id":"world/bashar-al-assad","webTitle":"Bashar al-Assad","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/bashar-al-assad","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-chulov","webTitle":"Martin Chulov","r2ContributorId":"29038","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290791972910/martin-chulov.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Chulov covers the Middle East for the Guardian.

Internet service providers in the country are now blocking the addresses used by the site, making it significantly more difficult to get around the restrictions, analysts have said.</p><p>The move follows threats last week from Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he would \"root out\" the social media network, which he claimed has been used to spread wiretapped recordings that have damaged his government's reputation.</p><p>Initially, Turkish internet service providers (ISPs) were simply redirecting traffic to a government webpage by forcing the DNS servers, which send to the correct IP addresses for the site they are trying to access, to redirect away from Twitter's homepage.</p><p>Now, however, ISPs have begun blocking the IP addresses used by Twitter themselves, according to an analysis carried out by internet monitoring firm Renesys. And a Turkish government webpage confirmed the block, citing court orders.</p><p>The move represents an escalation in the battle between the Erdogan regime and the social media network. His attempts to block the site on Thursday were derided by Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who flouted it himself.</p><p>In a series of messages posted on Twitter, he said: \"The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable. Besides, as I have said many times before, it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely. I hope this measure will not last long.\"</p><p>While more difficult, it is still technically possible to get around the ban if users can make it appear that they are accessing Twitter from outside Turkey.

I'm not listening,\" he said to cheers.</p><p>Erdogan, tackling a corruption scandal that could damage his AK party at local polls next Sunday, used a speech in the western city of Izmit also to announce Turkish forces had shot down a Syrian fighter that had crossed into Turkish air space.</p><p>Supporters waved red Turkish flags and blue and gold emblems of the AK party he founded in 2001 and led to power a year later, vowing to root out the corruption that had dogged rivals.</p><p>Western nations and rights groups have<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-users-flout-ban-erdogan\" title=\"\"> accused Turkey of intolerance for closing down the Twitter networking site </a>over anonymously posted audio tapes that implicate Erdogan in graft. Erdogan says tapes of phone conversations had been manipulated as part of a smear campaign.</p><p>\"The usual media are attacking us. What do they call it? 'Intolerance of freedoms',\" he said. \"I don't care who it is, I'm not listening. Even if the world stands up against us, I am obliged to take measure against every attack that threatens my nation's security.</p><p>\"This entity called Twitter, this YouTube, this Facebook, they have shaken families to their roots...I don't understand how people of good sense could defend this Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. There are all kinds of lies there.\"</p><p>Erdogan accuses Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally who helped him drive reforms including the taming of the armed forces, of leading a campaign to blacken his name and topple him. At a campaign speech on Saturday he described Gulen's network, which has influence in the police and judiciary, as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>The dramatic power struggle that has broken out between Erdogan and Gulen has undermined western perceptions of N member Turkey as an exemplary Muslim democracy and a possible anchor of stability in the Middle East.</p><p></p><p>Erdogan, his picture shown on banners across the country, draws heavily on his image as the strong leader Turkey has long lacked. His supporters still cherish the idea, while many critics feel strength has mutated to authoritarianism.</p><p>With familiar flourish Erdogan announced to the crowd Turkish forces had shot down a Syrian plane</p><p>\"A Syrian plane violated our airspace … Our F-16s took off and hit this plane. Why? Because if you violate my airspace, our slap after this will be hard.\"</p><p>Rebels have been fighting for control of the Kasab crossing, the border region, since Friday, when they launched an offensive which Syrian authorities say was backed by Turkey's military.</p><p>Syria said Turkish air defences shot down the jet while it was attacking rebel forces inside Syrian territory, calling the move a \"blatant aggression\".</p><p>While Erdogan spoke in Kocaeli, hundreds of thousands of supporters gathered on the shores on the Sea of Marmara in Istanbul on the approaches to the Bosphorus strait for what will be the climax of the electoral campaign.</p><p>Next Sunday's vote could yet decide the future of a man who at first won plaudits in the west and Middle East for his economic success and reforming drive, but has more recently come under heavy criticism as, in the eyes of many, an authoritarian, increasingly intolerant leader.</p><p>Not that all would share that view or be swayed by the accusations of corruption against him and his party. Erdogan remains by far the most popular politician and hopes to match or exceed the 40% vote AK received at local polls in 2009.</p><p>There is widespread expectation of further postings intended to damage Erdogan, who denies all graft accusations. These could emerge ahead of the local polls, where any result significantly below 40% could undermine his position and his prospects of election to a powerful presidency later this year.</p><p>But they could also emerge during the presidential election period itself. There is no open sign of any move against Erdogan in the AK party but a poor result next week could revive concern that emerged over his hard line against protesters last summer.</p><p>Ultimately, much could hinge on the opposition regaining the leadership and momentum it has lacked since 2002. Then, Erdogan drew on public anger over corruption in Turkey's old political elite, naming his new party AK, an acronym for justice and development, but also a word meaning clean or white.</p>","headline":"Erdogan tells critics: 'I'm not listening'","trailText":"Turkish PM announces shooting down of Syrian jet in speech on plans to 'take measure against every attack' on national security","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/23/1395590781302/Turkeys-PM-Erdogan--004.jpg","wordcount":"713","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-26T16:08:27Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/erdogan-turkey-election-speech-syria-jet-attack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/23/erdogan-turkey-election-speech-syria-jet-attack","tags":[{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432783267","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/23/1395590778188/Turkeys-PM-Erdogan--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Murad Sezer","altText":"Turkey's PM Erdogan ","height":"54","credit":"Murad Sezer/Reuters","caption":"Erdogan is tackling a corruption scandal that could damage his AK party at local polls next Sunday.

But be wary of assuming the net is always a liberating force","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Here we go again: authoritarian ruler finds that social media are making life uncomfortable for him in the run-up to elections; finds Twitter particularly annoying; instructs local authorities to shut off access for his citizens; announces that he is unbothered by international criticism of this act of censorship which, he says, will demonstrate the power of his republic.</p><p>Welcome to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\" title=\"\">Turkey</a>, our staunch ally in the fight against jihad and the Forces of Darkness. There is a certain grim familiarity in the story of Prime Minister Erdogan's battle against social media. He leads the AKP, the \"justice and development party\", that has been in power since 2002. It's now in its third term, having been returned in 2011 with just under half of the popular vote, but Erdogan rules as though he had the 99.9% share beloved of strong leaders everywhere.</p><p>Last December, in the course of a corruption investigation, Turkish police arrested <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/twitter-ban-erdogan-bringing-down-democracy-in-turkey-24643\" title=\"\">scores of people</a>, including three cabinet members and some of their offspring. The accusations of sleaze and corruption which lay behind the arrests are particularly annoying for a prime minister whose party lists \"fighting against corruption\" as one of its main goals.</p><p>Erdogan's response to the prosecution followed the authoritarian rule book to the letter: the prosecutors in charge of the investigation were summarily fired, as were a large number of police officers. A compliant parliament then amended the law to hand powers hitherto exercised by judges and prosecutors over to the justice minister. And it has also passed a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26311770\" title=\"\">new law</a> giving the authorities extensive powers to monitor internet use in Turkey.</p><p>In the old days, given that Erdogan seems to have control of Turkey's mainstream media, that would have been job done. But Twitter turned out to be a real thorn in his side, because links to leaked audio recordings of wiretapped phone conversations between journalists, business people and cabinet ministers were being regularly tweeted.</p><p>So in the end Erdogan's patience snapped and he lashed out. Turkey's telecommunications department announced that a \"protection measure\" had been taken for Twitter, \"according to Decision Nr dated 03.20.2014 of Istanbul Public Prosecutor (Article 10 With TMK Guard).\" You can guess what happened. Within seconds the ban was being openly flouted, circumvented and ridiculed, both within Erdogan's fiefdom and abroad. Twitter rapidly provided instructions (in both English and Turkish) on how to tweet using SMS. (\"Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 255.\") Many Turkish people <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/20/how-to-tweet-from-turkey/\" title=\"\">circumvented the ban</a> either by changing their DNS settings or by using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</p><p>EU Commissioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/neelie-kroes\" title=\"\">Neelie Kroes</a> tweeted that \"The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.\" And from Thursday evening onwards <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/21/twitter-ban-turkey-graffiti/\" title=\"\">graffiti </a>began appearing on buildings in Istanbul giving instruction about the new DNS settings that would circumvent the ban. Erdogan has become a laughing stock in less than a week.</p><p>So: authoritarian ruler nil, internet 1? Maybe, but it's really only a half-time score. It would be unwise to extrapolate too far from this little spat. Some commentators were quick to draw comparisons between Erdogan's Twitter ban and Hosni Mubarak's decision during the uprising against his rule to shut off Egypt's access to the net.</p><p>That particular experiment in isolationism ended after five days, and even today it's not clear why. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/02/mubaraks-digital-dilemma-why-egypts-internet-controls-failed/\" title=\"\">Some argue</a> that the regime's U-turn was forced by the realisation of the Egyptian military that their vast commercial interests were being harmed by the ban; others argue that the closure had the counter-productive effect of encouraging even more people on to the streets to find out what was going on.</p><p>In that context, it's even possible that Erdogan knew what he was doing. In a perceptive blog <a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/paul-mason-blog/reasons-turkeys-twitter-ban-matters-world/587#more-587\" title=\"\">post</a> on the Twitter decision, for example, Paul Mason argues that the ban may have been a gambit \"designed to force the secular, young and leftist opposition on to the streets during the election, boosting the turnout of their opponents, the conservative Islamist masses\".</p><p>Even so, Mason sees Erdogan's ploy as just the latest indication of a deeper trend. \"This is not about Turkey,\" he says, \"it's about the right to be modern.\" The ageing elites of the pre-internet age he says are slowly realising what young people are born knowing: you can't turn off the social media without turning off modernity and economic life.</p><p>The workaround Turkish tweeters are using exploits the fundamental strength of the internet: it is a network of networks, containing non-hierarchical pathways that simply do not allow you to switch part of it off. This is a signal moment in that process: a moment where a once-respected statesman turns into a Canute-like clown.\"</p><p>There is a whiff of technological determinism about this that makes me uneasy. Ever since the internet appeared on the scene in the 1980s the really big question that it posed was whether it would prove a powerful enough force to overthrow the established order.</p><p>Would the central elements of that order – the state, transnational corporations, military and hierarchical institutions generally – be \"disintermediated\", dissolved or bypassed by this new decentralised, empowering, liberating, democratising technology?</p><p>The honest answer is that it's too early to say. There have, of course, been some heartwarming examples of how the corrupt old order has been discombobulated and outmanoeuvred by the technology and its resourceful users. But in the last decade we have also seen how the internet has been commandeered by the established order – for example in the way the NSA and GCHQ have turned it into an Orwellian dream machine, and in the way the Chinese have invented a new form of tech-savvy governance – what the internet freedom campaigner Rebecca Mackinnon named <a href=\"http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/6349/MacKinnon_Libtech.pdf\" title=\"\">\"networked authoritarianism\"</a>.</p><p>Erdogan may or may not be a clown, but he's not really a serious player in this particular game. And hubris is a luxury that only fools can afford.</p>","headline":"As Turkey's Erdogan has discovered,  you can't turn off Twitter","trailText":"<p><strong>John Naughton: </strong>Users easily circumvented Erdogan's Twitter ban.

Erdogan blames social media for helping to publicise leaked tapes allegedly linking him to a corruption scandal that has rocked his government. He has threatened similar action against YouTube and Facebook. \"This thing called social media is currently the worst menace to society,\" he declared last year during nationwide demonstrations against his increasingly authoritarian rule. Announcing his Twitter ban, he said: \"The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all.\" In the event, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-users-flout-ban-erdogan\" title=\"\">Twitter use rose 138%</a> in 24 hours as users easily circumvented his ban.</p><p>Foolish or not, it would be daft to dismiss Erdogan. His self-confidence is impressive. After three consecutive general election victories and more than 10 years in power, when Turkey's economy grew by 5%, per capita productivity almost doubled, and its regional influence expanded, Erdogan seems to think he has a right to rule. But the shine has gone off his leadership in the past 12 months. His strong leader image has been supplanted, for many, by that of bad-tempered bully.</p><p>The immediate spark for the Twitter furore is local elections due a week today, viewed as a key test of Erdogan's enduring appeal. He has been campaigning hard, rallying the rural and urban working-class voters who care little for social media and corruption scandals, but like the ruling AKP's trademark handouts and subsidies. On these results may depend Erdogan's expected run for the presidency in August.</p><p>But additional obstacles loom. One is the now open hostility of the influential Sunni cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whose opposition has split Erdogan's conservative base. Another is Turkey's popular president, Abdullah Gul, whom Erdogan hopes to replace. Gul is showing signs of independence. He reacted to the Twitter ban by publicly deploring it – on Twitter. And Gul is no fool.</p>","headline":"Erdogan's shabby attempts to stifle his critics are doomed","trailText":"<p><strong>Observer editorial: </strong>Recep Tayyip Erdogan's attempted ban on Twitter

Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's birthday present to the social media giant, and to millions of Turks who use it daily, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\" title=\"Guardian: Turkey blocks use of Twitter after prime minister attacks social media site\">was to block the site</a>. At about 11.20pm last night, those who wanted to use Twitter were greeted by a message from the Telecommunications Presidency referencing a court order that blocked access to it.</p><p>Within minutes, detailed methods of bypassing the block by changing DNS numbers and using VPNs were shared via Facebook, WhatsApp and text message. Hashtags using the Turkish for \"Twitter Is Blocked in Turkey\", \"Turkey Blocked Twitter\" and \"Dictator Erdoğan\" began trending worldwide almost immediately. When the official Turkish account of Twitter tweeted, \"Turkish users can send Tweets using SMS\" and gave detailed instructions, Turks were already ahead of the game.</p><p>Actually, there were no shortage of tweets sent from Turkey at all. <a href=\"http://twitturk.com/\" title=\"TwitTurk website\">TwitTurk</a>, a website that records statistics of Turkish Twitter users, reported that more than 500,000 tweets were sent in the first two hours of the ban. Ironically enough, star names of Erdoğan's Justice and Development party (AKP), such as deputy prime minister Bülent Arınç and mayor of Ankara Melih Gökçek, continued tweeting well into today.</p><p>What's more, the AKP also continued to create promoted tweets and trends – services Twitter provides for a hefty amount of money. The hashtag \"Gökçek Kuzey Yıldızı\" (Gökçek North Star), a campaign sponsored by AKP's Ankara branch to promote Gökçek's controversial project to build a giant mosque in the capital, became the number one trending topic in Turkey in the first couple of hours of the ban. Another pro-AKP account promoted the ruling party's recent television broadcast, depicting hundreds running towards a Turkish flagpole – in the fashion of zombies from World War Z – after hearing Erdoğan's voice reading the national anthem.</p><p>As they did during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/whats-happening-in-turkey-occupy-gezi\" title=\"Guardian: What's happening in Turkey?\">Occupy Gezi days</a>, Turkish citizens created memes mocking the Twitter ban. However, neither the jokes nor the fact that tech-savvy Turks bypassed the ban without batting an eyelid are enough to shield us from the grim reality behind recent censorship. Twitter has become pivotal in organising anti-government dissent in the past year: the Occupy Gezi movement, which marches against the recently passed internet censorship bill that allows the government to block any content within four hours without a court order, and the massive street protest and the funeral attended by hundreds of thousands after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/turkish-police-teargas-crowds-mourning-berkin-elvan\" title=\"Guardian: Turkish police fire teargas at crowds mourning boy injured in protests\">death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan</a>, were initiated via social media.</p><p>Twitter has also become the main channel for talking about corruption allegations implicating Erdoğan and his family. Anonymous accounts leak alleged phone recordings of Erdoğan. Waiting for new recordings to surface around 9pm each night has become the most popular pastime of millions of Turks, who then spread the news like wildfire. These accounts have been announcing that the mother of all recordings will come out on 25 March, a mere five days before the upcoming local elections. Erdoğan, aware of this, said yesterday in an election rally hours before the block took effect: \"We will eradicate Twitter. I do not care what the international community says.\"</p><p>It looks like the Turkish public does not care what Erdoğan says either. Recent history around the world and in Turkey shows that social media is a serious threat to autocrats.

Last week, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/03/12/russian-news-editor-fired-after-interviewing-ukrainian-nationalist/\">Galina Timchenko was ousted as editor</a> of the Russian news site Lenta.ru, after publishing an interview with a right wing Ukrainian nationalist. She was replaced with an editor much more friendly toward Putin and his allies. The websites of opposition leaders Garry Kasparov and Alexei Navalny have also been targeted, along with <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-russia-internet-idUSBREA2C21L20140313\">other sites critical</a> of the Russian president. </p><p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the embattled Turkish prime minister, recently pushed new censorship legislation through parliament, making it easier for the government to block web content – and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-users-flout-ban-erdogan\">now Twitter is restricted across the country</a>. </p><p>Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro has <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/venezuela-cracks-down-on-internet-as-economy-implodes/\">blocked websites</a> covering topics that might be a bit uncomfortable for his government, such as skyrocketing inflation and anti-government protests. </p><p>World leaders may be cracking down on dissenting voices online – if ever there were a global trend, it’s that the revolution will be tweeted, and then restricted – but research shows there are reasons to be very optimistic about the future of internet freedom.</p><p>According to Freedom House (<a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013%20Summary%20of%20Findings.pdf\">pdf</a>), 24 nations have added new laws or regulations that restrict online speech since May 2012. Three years after the Arab Spring began in earnest, and a quarter century after he invented the world wide web, the foundation of Tim Berners-Lee <a href=\"https://thewebindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Web-Index-Annual-Report-2013-FINAL.pdf\">has found</a> that “targeted blocking and filtering of politically sensitive Web content by governments is also on the rise across the globe”. </p><p>Indeed, governments are becoming more clever about how to restrict speech in cyberspace, using laws against cybercrime, blasphemy or terrorism. But in a remarkably short period of time, people around the world have embraced the idea of an internet free from censorship. <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/03/19/emerging-and-developing-nations-want-freedom-on-the-internet/\">A new report here from the Pew Research Center</a> shows that majorities in 22 of 24 emerging and developing nations from across the globe say it is important that people have access to the internet without government censorship. This includes solid majorities in Putin’s Russia (63%) and Erdogan’s Turkey (58%). And in Maduro’s Venezuela, a stunning 89% oppose internet censorship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-80167292-80f1-4830-871a-6babb2064fb7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395414075890/0c03cf6c-a399-414d-b1ec-cc4e795b5e44-196x420.png\" alt=\"Turkey Twitter graphic\" width=\"196\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A recent survey by the Pew Research Center shows that for most people, access to the internet without government censorship is important. Image: Courtesy of Pew Research Center</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The data also show why autocrats might have reason to fear open discussions in cyberspace. Internet usage, participation in social networking and support for internet freedom are generally more common among young people, the college educated and those with higher incomes – exactly the groups who are often at the forefront of protest movements and political change. For example, when  Hosni Mubarak fell from power in 2011, only <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/04/25/chapter-1-views-of-political-change/\">23% of Egyptians said</a> they were getting news and information about the political situation in their country via social networking – however, among college-educated Egyptians the number was 67%.</p><p>Overall, there is a strong relationship between internet adoption and support for internet freedom: the higher the percentage of people online in a given country, the greater the opposition to censorship.</p><p>Among the emerging and developing nations we surveyed in 2013, support for an uncensored internet is high in places like Chile and Argentina, where roughly two-thirds of the population goes online; meanwhile, it’s relatively low in countries such as Pakistan, Uganda and Indonesia, where internet penetration remains limited. </p><p>Our research shows that once people get access to the internet, they quickly begin incorporating it into their lives. In 19 of 22 nations we polled, half or more of internet users said they go online daily. The data on views about censorship suggest that people not only begin to include the internet in their daily lives, they also bring it into their political thinking, and make free expression on the internet a political priority, just like other civil liberties. </p><p>Speaking in 2010, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton updated Franklin Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms by <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/21/internet_freedom\">adding one for the 21st century</a>: the freedom to connect – “the idea that governments should not prevent people from connecting to the internet, to websites, or to each other. The freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly in cyberspace.” </p><p>It may be a while before the freedom to connect trumps <a href=\"http://www.fdrfourfreedomspark.org/pages/the-four-freedoms\">Roosevelt’s original four</a> – freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. But the internet has already become an important public gathering place, and as access spreads to more and more people around the globe, it will become a central feature of politics nearly everywhere – not just a meme but a reality. Even Putin and Erdogan may not be able to shut down sites quickly enough.</p>","headline":"Turkey's Twitter block and propaganda be damned: revolutions will be tweeted","trailText":"<b>Richard

In short, using just two numerical codes,&nbsp;users are tricking their device into thinking they’re using it from somewhere other than Turkey. </p><p>Users can change their DNS by changing two codes which act as an identifier for the device they are using. Head of the webspam team at Google Matt Cutts tweeted the codes for Google’s Public DNS:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mattcutts/statuses/446939287733280768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Google Public DNS is fast with great uptime.

In a first reaction to the ban, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the European commission, tweeted: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeelieKroesEU/status/446784267541291008\" title=\"\">The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly</a>. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.\"</p><p>Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: \"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards.\"</p><p>The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.</p><p>Shortly after the Twitter ban came into effect about midnight, the microblogging company tweeted instructions to users in Turkey on how to circumvent it using text messaging services in Turkish and English. Turkish tweeters were quick to share other methods of tiptoeing around the ban, using \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs) – which allow internet users to connect to the web undetected – or changing the domain name settings on computers and mobile devices to conceal their geographic whereabouts.</p><p>Some large Turkish news websites also published step-by-step instructions on how to change domain name system (DNS) settings.</p><p>On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets –  17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting  records for Twitter use in the country. \"Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan,\" posted @Fakir_Bey. \"And yours?\"</p><p>But it was not just critics of the government who took to Twitter after the site was closed. The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökcek, famous for his extensive and rather bullish use of the micro-blogging site, was the first politician from Erdogan's ruling AK party to breach the ban. \"I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it. That will probably be banned tomorrow as well. I hope that all those who are cursing and using fake accounts will have learnt their lesson,\" he tweeted, as usual all in capitals.</p><p>The first cabinet member to post a tweet after the ban came into effect was the deputy prime minister, Bülent Arinç, who informed his 1.34 million followers of an election rally in the city of Manisa. His message was retweeted more than 1,000 times in the first hour, causing much ridicule:</p><p>\"Oh dear, be careful, Twitter has been banned by the \"national will\",\" replied Ayse Cavdar, an academic and journalist. \"Don't show up here. Otherwise the \"national will\" will close you down, too.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, Ali Babacan, said he expected the ban to be temporary. \"I don't think this will last too long. A mutual solution needs to be found,\" Babacan told a local TV channel on Friday.</p><p>In a rare act of defiance, the Turkish president, Abdullah Gül, openly criticised the ban – via his Twitter account. \"The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,\" he tweeted. \"Besides, as I have said many times before, it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely. I hope this measure will not last long.\"</p><p>Later on Friday afternoon several Twitter users in Turkey reported that they were able to access the site again while Turkey's Telecommunications Authority (TIB) denied that the ban had been removed.</p><p>Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Işik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.</p><p>Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.</p><p>Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter \"a menace to society\".</p><p>Twitter has also been used to disseminate a series of  apparently incriminating audio recordings suggesting massive corruption inside the Turkish government.</p><p>Turkish officials stressed their discontent about Twitter's \"refusal to obey Turkish laws\" and to remove individual Twitter accounts that, according to court rulings, breached \"privacy rights\".</p><p>Many expect more explosive revelations to be made via Twitter in the week running up to local elections on 30 March. Two weeks ago Erdogan threatened to ban Facebook and Twitter, accusing social media users of abusing these platforms for a \"smear campaign\" against his government.</p><p>Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.</p><p>\"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism,\" said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.</p>","headline":"Turkey Twitter users flout Erdogan ban on micro-blogging site","trailText":"<p>Twitter use breaks new record in country as

The point was dismissed days later by the Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, but Erdoğan then repeated his claims. \"We will wipe out all of these,\" Erdoğan told thousands of supporters at a rally in the north-west province of Bursa.</p><p>\"The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,\" he said.</p><p>Previously, he said that his government was determined to stem the leaks he insisted were being instigated by followers of an influential US-based Muslim cleric, Reuters reported.</p><p>The agency said Erdoğan accused supporters of Fethullah Gülen of infiltrating police and the judiciary and of engaging in \"espionage\" saying that the group even listened in on his encrypted telephone lines. The Gülen movement denies involvement.</p><p>\"We are determined on the issue, regardless of what the world may say,\" Erdoğan said. \"We won't allow the people to be devoured by YouTube, Facebook or others. Whatever steps need to be taken we will take them without wavering.\"</p><p>Asked if the steps could include shutting those sites down, Erdoğan reportedly replied: \"That included. Because these people or institutions are [using social media] for all kinds of immorality, all kinds of espionage and spying.\"</p><p>Following his speech, Erdoğan's office said in a statement that Erdoğan was referring to what it called Twitter's failure to implement Turkish court orders seeking the removal of some links and that they may be left with no option but to ban the platform.</p><p>\"If Twitter officials insist on not implementing court orders and rules of law ... there will be no other option but to prevent access to Twitter to help satisfy our citizens' grievances,\" the statement said.</p><p>Turkish internet users were quick to come up with their own ways to circumvent the block. The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly moved among the top trending globally.</p><p>The disruption sparked a virtual uproar with many comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls to take to the street to protest, although some users equally called for calm.</p><p>Nazli Ilicak, a columnist who used to work for the pro-government Sabah newspaper described the move as \"a civil coup\" in an interview on broadcaster CNN Turk.</p>","headline":"Turkey blocks use of Twitter after prime minister attacks social media site","trailText":"<p>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatens to 'root out' social media network where wiretapped recordings have been leaked</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395361207293/-Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-tal-003.jpg","wordcount":"608","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-24T00:23:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/twitter","references":[]},{"id":"technology/youtube","webTitle":"YouTube","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/youtube","references":[]},{"id":"technology/facebook","webTitle":"Facebook","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/facebook","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"media/blogging","webTitle":"Blogging","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/blogging","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/blogging","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevin-rawlinson","webTitle":"Kevin Rawlinson","r2ContributorId":"58554","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Rawlinson is a freelance reporter who writes for the Guardian and other publications.

Last summer, Recep Tayyip Erdogan went so far as to brand social media \"the worst menace to society\" in this secular Islamic republic of 74&nbsp;million, where between 50% and 60% are under the age of 30. He laments a \"robot lobby\" – nefarious forces, which aim to take down his government with tweets on social media (his own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RT_Erdogan\" title=\"\">Twitter profile</a>, I suspect, is run by a communications team, and has 4.16 million followers).</p><p>Even his wife has chimed in to express her concerns over \"technology addiction\". Where Michelle Obama fights obesity, or Samantha Cameron glides around fashion councils, Emine&nbsp;Erdogan has said that social media is worse&nbsp;than alcohol, drugs and gambling.</p><p>Last week marked the funeral of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old boy died nine months after being hit by a police canister during the Gezi Park protests, reigniting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent\" title=\"\">a new wave of protests</a>. Erdogan did not utter a word of condolence. Ironically he emphasised his tech credentials instead, claiming that his role was to \"give children tablet computers\", not supply them with&nbsp;\"molotov cocktails, stones or slings\".</p><p>But<strong> </strong>who are these mighty robots launching \"hashtag wars\" on Twitter? Images from Battlestar Galactica spring to mind. Is my sister a soldier in the robot lobby? Will her eyes turn to lasers and fry our next family lunch?</p><p>Maybe the Erdogans have a point – are we just narcissistic millennials? Last week two guys in Istanbul even took and tweeted a selfie at a major police crackdown. The picture of protesters grinning defiantly as they were packed into the back of a police van became known as the \"<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/14/turkish-protest-ellen-selfie/\" title=\"\">Ellen selfie</a>\" and went viral.</p><p>Engin Önder is one of these \"technology addicts\" rattling the prime minister's offline cage. A co-founder of Turkey's popular citizen journalism network, <a href=\"http://140journos.com/\" title=\"\">140journos</a>, he and his friends have been documenting news <a href=\"https://twitter.com/140journos\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> since early 2012. They have tweeted ferociously from left, conservative and LGBTQ protests, as well as courtrooms where accredited journalists were not allowed in. Önder does not strike me as a member of some kind of robot lobby – but I remain sceptical.</p><p>\"I'd only attended one rally before 140journos,\" he says – a Don't Touch My Internet protest in June 2011. So if these twentysomethings are not really conspiring against the government, what exactly are they trying to achieve? His fellow co-founder Cem Aydogdu wanted to cover citizen news because his father had kicked him out of the house for reading alternative newspapers. \"Cem wanted to hack his parents and sway his father,\" says Önder.</p><p>As the Gezi protests kicked off, the 140journos network grew by six times almost overnight. The grievances of young people all around Turkey streamed through their timeline. Verifying and curating thousands of tweets 24/7, they did not leave his small apartment in Istanbul for days.</p><p>For Turkey's Generation Y, who grew up with the internet, defending the freedom to share information online becomes at least equally, if not more, important than individual politics. <a href=\"http://www.denizergurel.net/internet-in-turkey-2013/\" title=\"\">Just under 50% are online</a> every day. They are often willing to put themselves at personal risk to capture images from the frontline of protests.</p><p>Many are trying to hack a way out of the political crisis closing in on them. The deepening polarisation is intensified by Erdogan's bellicose rhetoric. Generation Y tweets through teargas to expose how absurd the reductive narratives of the political elite are. They poke fun at the dismissive language of government officials. They mock the mainstream media that is complicit in misrepresenting them.</p><p>The country's young protesters do not document their struggle on social media because they are narcissistic millennials. Yes, they want to be visible, but not for likes or pokes or friends; they document their resistance to cultivate social empathy for everyone. They are not a self-affirming group who bury their heads in the sand when violence hits other homes. They are aware that preaching to the young and already-converted, and ignoring the rest of Turkish society out in the analog cold generates a dangerous sense of \"us v them\". They do not want to be portrayed in these divisive terms, which cement their differences. There is no need.</p><p>Cem's father, for example, who used to read just one newspaper, has since become an activist who now encourages young people at protests to send reports to 140journos.</p><p>\"We are just like everyone else,\" says Ali Emre Mazlumoglu, one of the 13 protesters from the \"Ellen selfie in the police van\". \"But what makes us peculiar in the midst of all the pressure and violence is that we can still laugh our way through it all.\" Governed by a prime minister who can't stand political satire in cartoons, or thinks <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/woman-detained-over-gesture-at-turkish-pm-erdogan-claims-misunderstanding.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=63714&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">passersby who give him the middle finger should be detained</a>, young people in Turkey are holding on tight to their mobile phones – and to their sense of humour.</p><p>• This article was amended on 19 March.

The latest curbs came hours after an audio recording of a high-level security meeting was leaked on the video-sharing website.<br></p><p>According to Turkish media reports, the decision to block YouTube was taken by Turkey’s telecommunications authority (TİB) as a “precautionary administrative measure.” In February, Turkey passed a much criticised new internet law that allows the telecommunications regulator to block websites without a court order. Turkey previously banned YouTube in 2007, but lifted the ban three years later.</p><p>Social media users in Turkey were able to access the site using \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs) – which allow an anonymous connection to the web – or by changing the domain name settings (DNS) on computers and mobile devices.</p><p>\"We're seeing reports that some users are not able to access YouTube in Turkey. There is no technical issue on our side and we're looking into the situation,\" Google said in a statement emailed to the Guardian.</p><p>The move by the TIB came hours after an anonymous YouTube account posted a leaked audio recording allegedly of a confidential conversation between Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu, undersecretary of the foreign ministry Feridun Sinirlioglu and deputy chief of the general staff, Yasar Gürel, discussing possible military action in Syria.<br></p><p>A source at the prime minister's office told Reuters that the government had taken action against YouTube after the leak of the voice recordings created a \"national security issue\". The source said that Turkey was in talks with the video-sharing platform and may lift the ban if YouTube agreed to remove the content.</p><p>Several similarly incriminating recordings, allegedly showing massive government corruption and prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's direct influence on the media, have been leaked on social media in recent weeks. Erdogan has dismissed the allegations as lies and blackmail, accusing the opposition of trying to undermine the success of his Justice and Development party (AKP) ahead of critical local elections on Sunday.<br></p><p>Speaking at a campaign rally in Diyarbakir, Erdogan accused the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania, of being behind the leaks: “Pennsylvania commits treason. […] To publish this recording is villainous, cowardly and immoral. Who are you serving with the surveillance of such a meeting?”</p><p>A public statement published on the foreign ministry’s website called the leak “an act of espionage.” A local prosecutor’s office has meanwhile launched an investigation into the YouTube account.</p><p>The move against YouTube came after the TIB  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\">blocked access to Twitter on Friday</a>. That created outrage in Turkey, where social media is widely used, and a court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban\">overturned the block on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>Friday's Twitter block came hours after Erdoğan vowed on the campaign trail to get rid of Twitter. He said on Tuesday that the network \"was threatening national security\" and that it had refused to co-operate with the Turkish authorities.</p>","headline":"Turkey blocks YouTube amid 'national security' concerns","trailText":"Turkish PM's office claim voice recordings posted to video-sharing website created a 'national security issue' leading to ban","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937199007/badef62b-59c8-4d02-aabe-2370258f8a0a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"487","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T15:23:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/youtube","webTitle":"YouTube","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/youtube","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominic-rushe","webTitle":"Dominic Rushe","r2ContributorId":"41799","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156653419/doiminixrushe_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Rushe is the US business correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominic-rushe","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-ec11b5f6-39ce-4530-a108-ecaf71062f10","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937201348/badef62b-59c8-4d02-aabe-2370258f8a0a-68x68.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937201348/badef62b-59c8-4d02-aabe-2370258f8a0a-68x68.jpeg","source":"Reuters","photographer":"Osman Orsal","altText":"Youtube Turkey","height":"68","credit":"Osman Orsal/Reuters","caption":"A man tries to get connected to the youtube web site with his tablet at a cafe in Istanbul on Thursday.

All his ministers, everyone in their party listens to Erdogan. He is ready to risk anything just to stay in power.\"</p><p>Tension in the district has soared in the run-up to Sunday's ballot because of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent\" title=\"\">the killings of two youths locally</a> in clashes with police.</p><p>Much is at stake. Turks will go to the polls against a backdrop of increasing political turmoil and in the first popular test for Erdogan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/turkey-divided-erdogan-protests-crackdown\" title=\"\">since last summer's widespread street protests</a>.</p><p>The prime minister has faced multiple challenges to his 11-year-rule amid growing opposition to his authoritarian style. In response to allegations of mass corruption inside the government, Erdogan appears to have opted for a strategy of dividing the country into loyalists and traitors. He purged the police and judiciary of critics and passed laws that weakened constitutional checks and balances on the executive.</p><p>In the past week, in a further sign of crackdown on dissenters, Turkey's telecoms authority blocked access to Twitter and on Thursday announced that it was taking similar action against YouTube.</p><p>On Tuesday, the daily newspaper Hürriyet resorted to publishing an open letter to the prime minister after he rounded on its parent company, Dogan Media, for its criticism of the government.</p><p>\"We expect you to not discriminate between citizens and institutions as the prime minister of 76 million people,\" the newspaper told Erdogan. \"Whatever percentage of votes you get, it should be your and all of our duty after the elections to defuse the dangerous polarisation and the tension that has spread throughout the whole country.\"</p><p>The consequences of this divide-and-rule strategy are evident in Okmeydani, a neighbourhood in Istanbul's central Beyoglu district, that recently made headlines following the deaths of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/turkish-police-teargas-crowds-mourning-berkin-elvan\" title=\"\">Berkin Elvan, a teenager who died after being hit in the head</a> by a teargas canister during last summer's protests, and of Burakcan Karamanoglu, a 22-year-old who was shot in the head during clashes between opposing groups in the neighbourhood.</p><p>The youths lived on opposing sides of the riven community. In the upper part of Okmeydani, predominantly housing the Alevi minority, countless graffiti slogans show the dominance of radical leftist groups. \"No entry to fascists\" and \"Berkin Elvan is immortal\", they read.</p><p>On the other side of the \"border\", the flags of rightwing, Islamist and conservative parties prevail. Graffiti proclaims \"Okmeydani will be a graveyard for communism\" and \"Martyrs never die\". Almost all the shops on the lively high street display posters mourning Karamanoglu.</p><p>Despite public pleas by both youths' fathers not to exploit their son's deaths for political purposes, Erdogan repeatedly lauded Karamanoglu as a martyr during campaign rallies, while calling 15-year-old Elvan, who was killed by a teargas capsule while going to buy bread, a terrorist.</p><p>A local shop owner said he was alarmed by the prime minister's comments: \"If you call one boy that was killed a terrorist, and another that was killed in the same neighbourhood a martyr, what do you think will happen?\" Does he feel forced to take sides? The man shakes his head, but adds that he is uncomfortable with the rising tension. \"There have not been any threats, but the psychological pressure is high. I have children, too, and I am afraid for them and their future.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees. In a shop a few yards up the street, the 46-year-old owner brushes off the concerns. \"I have lived here for over 30 years,\" he explains. \"We get along fine. There have been some tragic events, but we will not let that come between us.\"</p><p>At a nearby election rally for Kadir Topbas, the mayoral candidate of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), hundreds of supporters brandish Turkish flags, AKP scarves and posters of Karamanoglu. It is early afternoon, and the crowd consists predominantly of women.</p><p>\"We owe much to our prime minister,\" says a 42-year-old woman who wishes to remain anonymous. \"I still remember when I was not allowed to wear my headscarf, when I was humiliated for it. I remember rubbish in the streets. We didn't have running water.\"</p><p>A textile worker, 49, agrees that life has improved under the Erdogan government. \"Before there was crime, and the streets were dirty. There was nothing to buy in the store – no sugar, no cigarettes, nothing. Now we have everything in abundance. We also have peace, no more soldiers are dying.\" In his eyes, there is no viable alternative. \"If the [opposition Republican People's party] CHP would produce a good leader, we would vote for him. But we can't see anyone.\"</p><p>In another part of town some men from Okmeydani have joined the rally of the CHP mayoral candidate Mustafa Sarigül. They say that they feel threatened by the government's increasingly anti-Alevi stance.</p><p>Hamdi, 45, a musician, cites a planned urban renewal project as his biggest fear: \"If the AKP wins again, Okmeydani will be lost. It will simply disappear, with all the poor people in it. It will make way for big residences and the rich.\"</p><p>Referring to recent and repeated attacks on CHP election offices in the area, one man adds: \"But they will not win votes by attacking us with knives and sticks. They use religion to divide us, but that will not work either.\"</p><p>One local craftsman suggests that Erdogan's style of governing has become untenable for the country: \"In Turkey, we now have the situation that one half of the country loves the prime minister unconditionally whereas the other half not only does not vote for him, but truly hates him. One half of the country cannot stand to hear his voice, or see his face on posters, or on TV. How can you rule a country like that?\"</p>","headline":"Turkish PM divides nation and neighbourhoods ahead of local elections","trailText":"In one Istanbul district, armoured cars guard 'border' separating Erdogan loyalists and those backing the opposition","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395935011419/Supporters-of-Turkeys-pri-004.jpg","wordcount":"1018","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T14:57:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/turkish-pm-erdogan-divides-nation-local-elections","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/27/turkish-pm-erdogan-divides-nation-local-elections","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433145895","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395935006706/Supporters-of-Turkeys-pri-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Adem Altan","altText":"Supporters of Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayipp Erdogan, during an election rally in Ankara","height":"54","credit":"Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Supporters of Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayipp Erdogan, during an election rally in Ankara.

It is.\"</p><p>Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: \"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards.\"</p><p>The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.</p><p>Shortly after the Twitter ban came into effect about midnight, the microblogging company tweeted instructions to users in Turkey on how to circumvent it using text messaging services in Turkish and English. Turkish tweeters were quick to share other methods of tiptoeing around the ban, using \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs) – which allow internet users to connect to the web undetected – or changing the domain name settings on computers and mobile devices to conceal their geographic whereabouts.</p><p>Some large Turkish news websites also published step-by-step instructions on how to change domain name system (DNS) settings.</p><p>On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets –  17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting  records for Twitter use in the country. \"Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan,\" posted @Fakir_Bey. \"And yours?\"</p><p>But it was not just critics of the government who took to Twitter after the site was closed. The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökcek, famous for his extensive and rather bullish use of the micro-blogging site, was the first politician from Erdogan's ruling AK party to breach the ban. \"I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it. That will probably be banned tomorrow as well. I hope that all those who are cursing and using fake accounts will have learnt their lesson,\" he tweeted, as usual all in capitals.</p><p>The first cabinet member to post a tweet after the ban came into effect was the deputy prime minister, Bülent Arinç, who informed his 1.34 million followers of an election rally in the city of Manisa. His message was retweeted more than 1,000 times in the first hour, causing much ridicule:</p><p>\"Oh dear, be careful, Twitter has been banned by the \"national will\",\" replied Ayse Cavdar, an academic and journalist. \"Don't show up here. Otherwise the \"national will\" will close you down, too.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, Ali Babacan, said he expected the ban to be temporary. \"I don't think this will last too long. A mutual solution needs to be found,\" Babacan told a local TV channel on Friday.</p><p>In a rare act of defiance, the Turkish president, Abdullah Gül, openly criticised the ban – via his Twitter account. \"The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,\" he tweeted. \"Besides, as I have said many times before, it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely. I hope this measure will not last long.\"</p><p>Later on Friday afternoon several Twitter users in Turkey reported that they were able to access the site again while Turkey's Telecommunications Authority (TIB) denied that the ban had been removed.</p><p>Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Işik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.</p><p>Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.</p><p>Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter \"a menace to society\".</p><p>Twitter has also been used to disseminate a series of  apparently incriminating audio recordings suggesting massive corruption inside the Turkish government.</p><p>Turkish officials stressed their discontent about Twitter's \"refusal to obey Turkish laws\" and to remove individual Twitter accounts that, according to court rulings, breached \"privacy rights\".</p><p>Many expect more explosive revelations to be made via Twitter in the week running up to local elections on 30 March. Two weeks ago Erdogan threatened to ban Facebook and Twitter, accusing social media users of abusing these platforms for a \"smear campaign\" against his government.</p><p>Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.</p><p>\"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism,\" said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.</p>","headline":"Turkey Twitter users flout Erdogan ban on micro-blogging site","trailText":"<p>Twitter use breaks new record in country as

If we bow to this, we will be doing injustice to all coming prime ministers and ministers.\"</p><p>In the recording, a man alleged to be Erdogan tells his son to dispose of tens of millions as investigators are searching the homes of relatives of three cabinet ministers \"for a big corruption operation\".</p><p>\"OK, so what I am saying is, get all that stuff in your house out. OK?\" he says.</p><p>A voice alleged to be that of his son, Billal replies: \"Dad, could that be? There is your money in the safe.\" The older man's voice responds: \"That's what I mean.\"</p><p>Later, the person alleged to be the prime minister asks: \"Did you make most of it vanish?\" He is answered: \"We haven't been able to do all of it yet. There are about 30m euros left. We haven't been able to get that out yet.\"</p><p>Erdogan described the recordings as \"blackmail, being spread via Twitter\".</p><p>But he admitted his phone had been tapped in what he called \"Turkey's biggest eavesdropping scandal of all times\".</p><p>Pro-government newspapers have claimed that thousands of government officials, academics, business people and journalists have been listened to illegally. It has been impossible to verify the authenticity of the recordings, which first appeared on YouTube but quickly spread across social media sites. Even so, they are likely to inflict a painful political blow.</p><p>The alleged conversation is said to have taken place on 17 December last year – a day on which police conducted a series of surprise raids that resulted in the arrest of the sons of three government ministers and several high-profile businessmen.</p><p>Since December, Erdogan has removed or fired the key people involved in these investigations, reappointed thousands of police officials and prosecutors, and rushed through laws tightening government control over the judiciary and prosecution services.</p><p>He has repeatedly blamed the US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen – a former ally – for orchestrating what he says is a campaign aimed at toppling the government.</p><p>Erogan has held emergency meetings with the head of the Turkish secret intelligence agency, Hakan Fidan, since the recordings emerged, Turkish media has reported. The prime minister's office has issued a statement threatening legal action against anyone who circulated them.</p><p>The main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) has demanded that Erdogan resign. Speaking at a party meeting on Tuesday, the CHP leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said there was little doubt about the authenticity of the recordings and that the government had lost its legitimacy.</p><p>\"Take your helicopter and flee, go abroad, or resign from the prime ministry. Someone who robs the country cannot sit in the seat of a prime minister,\" he said.</p><p>Devlet Bahceli, head of the right-wing National Movement party (MHP), used equally damning words in local election rally speech on Tuesday: \"This is a very critical moment for Turkey. Hunger, injustice, immorality, corruption and bribery are amongst Turkey's main problems. This is the image we have of eleven years of [the AKP's rule].</p><p>said: \"There are signs that the prime minister is at the head of corruption in Turkey. The prime minister speaks of a plot. If it really is a lie and a plot, it should be proven to the people. But if any of this is true, he cannot remain prime minister for even one second longer.

The good jobs, the better pay, the promotion prospects all depended on your dedication to a shadowy Islamic network with its headquarters based in Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"They kept tabs on every recruit, had a grading system from zero to five – five being the ones who prayed, fasted, never drank alcohol,\" the policeman said, referring to the movement founded by the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, who lives in exile in the US.</p><p>\"Everything starts in the police schools,\" said Yilmaz. \"They came to me once, I said no. But it's very subtle. One day a friend will ask you to go to breakfast at a certain friend's house, to read a certain book, go for dinner. These appointments become more and more regular. When you're in school, you have very little money. They organise a few things to make it easier. Free meals, for example, free accommodation. Once you're inside, they organise your life; you just get sucked in. And once you graduate, you can start working in whichever unit you like.\"</p><p>The power and the influence of the elderly cleric is the defining issue of Turkish politics. Recep Tayyıp Erdoğan, the prime minister, has declared war on Gülen – previously a key ally of his conservative, Islamic ruling party – following the eruption of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/turkish-ministers-sons-arrested-corruption-investigation\" title=\"\">corruption scandal in December</a> that implicates the government, the prime minister's closest associates and his family.</p><p>Erdoğan responded ferociously, purging the police of thousands of officers, transferring prosecutors linked to the investigation and tightening control over the judiciary. A fortnight ago, according to senior officials in Brussels, he told EU leaders that his fight with Gülen was a matter of political survival. \"He was gripped with this obsession of killing the parallel state, as he called it,\" said a well-placed EU official.</p><p>In Turkey it has long been assumed that Gülen's network exercised unaccountable influence inside the judicial and security apparatus. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jan/09/press-freedom-turkey\" title=\"\">investigative journalist Ahmet Şık</a> was jailed for writing a book about it, as was Hanefi Avcı, a former police chief. But that was when Erdoğan and Gülen were allies.</p><h2><strong>Assertion</strong></h2><p>In 2009 the then US ambassador in Ankara, James Jeffrey, wrote in a cable to the state department: \"The assertion that the Turkish national police is controlled by Gülenists is impossible to confirm but we have found no one who disputes it.\"</p><p>Yilmaz and other police officers who spoke up confirmed the scale and degree of penetration by adherents of a movement that is religious, cultural and educational as well as political.</p><p>Oğuz Gün* has been working in the Istanbul police force for more than seven years. \"Such opaque groups are very dangerous. And [Gülen's] is a group that discriminates against those who don't share the same values and the same lifestyle. I have seen how they started to mistake sins for crimes, both inside and outside the force,\" he said.</p><p>He sought transfers to other units: secret intelligence, anti-terror, organised crime. To no avail. Gün was never affiliated with the Gülenist movement. \"Sometimes they openly asked for a reference. Without it, I didn't stand a chance.\"</p><p>Yilmaz said: \"If you asked someone how did you manage to get into the secret intelligence unit, they would answer: I prayed and got in. We had friends who spoke six languages, were top of their class, and were standing guard outside police stations. And others who were a lot less qualified got the top jobs only because they were connected with the Gülenists.\"</p><p>The assumption in Turkey and abroad is that the corruption allegations against the Erdoğan administration originate with Gülen, and that they are likely to be well-founded because of the quality of the intelligence the movement commands. Erdoğan is seen to be trying not only to destroy the cleric but also to bury the corruption allegations.</p><p>Şık, the journalist jailed in 2011 for writing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/turkey-censorship-ahmet-sik-perrier\" title=\"\">book on Gülen's penetration of the police</a>, highlighted what many see as the problem. \"The attempt to purge Gülenists doesn't mean that [Erdoğan] is right. There is also a real witchhunt going on. We have massive corruption on the one hand, but the investigation against it also violates democratic and judicial principles. It's a choice between a rock and a hard place, pest and cholera. One is not better, or cleaner, than the other.\"</p><p>The officers welcomed the backlash against the network inside the police but stressed that it should not serve to legitimise corruption. \"Of course I want those who are corrupt to be punished. I am not defending corruption at all. But these purges were long overdue,\" said Yilmaz. \"The government knew about this. It was the government in the first place who enabled them, who helped them, they came to power together. Helping them was the government's biggest mistake.\"</p><p>Gün spoke of a huge sense of relief among his colleagues that the police were being cleared of the network. \"It really was an atmosphere of deep paranoia. Even if it seemed technically impossible for every single officer's phone to be tapped, we were all afraid of being spied on all the time.\"</p><p>The pressure was subtle, but constant: \"Nobody would force you to pray, or fast during Ramadan. But they kept tabs on all of that, on everyone. Nobody talked about it. Everybody knew, but nobody dared to discuss the issue. This has started to change.\"</p><p>Erdoğan's offensive represents a sea change. The domination of his Justice and Development party (AKP) for more than a decade was aided by his alliance with Gülen, the cleric's formidable organisation, money and influence.</p><p>Those who dared to criticise the Gülen movement before were swiftly punished. Şık was accused of being a member of a nationalist network, although he and his colleagues had previously disclosed plans by the same network to stage a military coup against the AKP government. He was released from jail in 2012, but his trial is ongoing.</p><h2><strong>Phone-tapping</strong></h2><p>In 2010 Hanefi Avcı, a former police chief and former Gülen supporter, was arrested on charges of being a member of a terrorist organisation after publishing a book in which he described the infiltration of the Turkish police force by the Gülenists and accused them of illegally tapping phones and falsifying evidence. Last year the self-described rightwing sympathiser was sentenced to more than 15 years in jail for membership of the armed leftwing group Revolutionary Headquarters.</p><p>Erdoğan's current purges are dramatic and far-reaching. But the officers say such purges have been taking place more quietly for years. According to both Yilmaz and Gün, internal investigations have been conducted against tens of thousands of police officers over the past four years alone. \"If someone was suspected of going against [Gülen] they were often hit with made-up disciplinary charges, transferred to bad posts, or even suspended,\" Gün said. \"The removals we see today are not new. They just hit the other camp.\"</p><p>Not all police officers, however, are as happy with the current purges. The Police Reform Group, an organisation campaigning for police rights, tweeted: \"How do you know that the officers who were transferred are Gülenists and members of an organisation? Do you have a detector? Where is justice?\"</p><p>EU officials monitoring the drama say Erdoğan is deploying an indiscriminate dragnet in the belief that it will catch all the Gülen appointments. Yilmaz agrees. \"I am guessing that not all of these guys were Gülenists. And not all sympathisers were bad, either. And no police officer should ever be punished just for doing a good job.\"</p><p>Faruk Sezer, a founding member of the unofficial police union Emniyet-Sen, argued that a transparent inquiry into the alleged shadow organisation was indispensable. \"If an officer committed a crime, it needs to be brought to light and that person needs to be suspended and punished. But those who were transferred without reason and proof should of course be reinstated.\"</p><p>Last month Istanbul prosecutors started an investigation into officers who took part in anti-corruption raids in December. Do police officers fear doing their job in such a loaded atmosphere? Yilmaz shrugged: \"We have started to tell jokes among ourselves like: oh dear, you caught a shoplifter, you'd better start packing your bags, you'll get transferred for that.\"</p><p>\"The war between Gülen and the government will not end any time soon,\" said Şık. \"Turkish people caught in the middle will suffer. We already live in a very oppressive period, and I am afraid that this might get much worse.\"</p><p><em>* Names have been changed.</em></p>","headline":"Turkish police caught in middle of war between Erdoğan and former ally Gülen","trailText":"Some officers welcome crackdown on shadowy network around exiled cleric but stress it should not serve to legitimise corruption","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391954231418/Turkish-riot-police-006.jpg","wordcount":"1400","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-12T14:04:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-fethullah-gulen-network","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-fethullah-gulen-network","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"world/islam","webTitle":"Islam","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/islam","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429289437","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391954222472/Turkish-riot-police-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Jivan Guner","altText":"Turkish riot police","height":"54","credit":"Jivan Guner/EPA","caption":"Turkish riot police take cover during clashes with anti-government protesters in Istanbul.
