Last summer, Recep Tayyip Erdogan went so far as to brand social media \"the worst menace to society\" in this secular Islamic republic of 74&nbsp;million, where between 50% and 60% are under the age of 30. He laments a \"robot lobby\" – nefarious forces, which aim to take down his government with tweets on social media (his own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RT_Erdogan\" title=\"\">Twitter profile</a>, I suspect, is run by a communications team, and has 4.16 million followers).</p><p>Even his wife has chimed in to express her concerns over \"technology addiction\". Where Michelle Obama fights obesity, or Samantha Cameron glides around fashion councils, Emine&nbsp;Erdogan has said that social media is worse&nbsp;than alcohol, drugs and gambling.</p><p>Last week marked the funeral of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old boy died nine months after being hit by a police canister during the Gezi Park protests, reigniting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent\" title=\"\">a new wave of protests</a>. Erdogan did not utter a word of condolence. Ironically he emphasised his tech credentials instead, claiming that his role was to \"give children tablet computers\", not supply them with&nbsp;\"molotov cocktails, stones or slings\".</p><p>But<strong> </strong>who are these mighty robots launching \"hashtag wars\" on Twitter? Images from Battlestar Galactica spring to mind. Is my sister a soldier in the robot lobby? Will her eyes turn to lasers and fry our next family lunch?</p><p>Maybe the Erdogans have a point – are we just narcissistic millennials? Last week two guys in Istanbul even took and tweeted a selfie at a major police crackdown. The picture of protesters grinning defiantly as they were packed into the back of a police van became known as the \"<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/03/14/turkish-protest-ellen-selfie/\" title=\"\">Ellen selfie</a>\" and went viral.</p><p>Engin Önder is one of these \"technology addicts\" rattling the prime minister's offline cage. A co-founder of Turkey's popular citizen journalism network, <a href=\"http://140journos.com/\" title=\"\">140journos</a>, he and his friends have been documenting news <a href=\"https://twitter.com/140journos\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> since early 2012. They have tweeted ferociously from left, conservative and LGBTQ protests, as well as courtrooms where accredited journalists were not allowed in. Önder does not strike me as a member of some kind of robot lobby – but I remain sceptical.</p><p>\"I'd only attended one rally before 140journos,\" he says – a Don't Touch My Internet protest in June 2011. So if these twentysomethings are not really conspiring against the government, what exactly are they trying to achieve? His fellow co-founder Cem Aydogdu wanted to cover citizen news because his father had kicked him out of the house for reading alternative newspapers. \"Cem wanted to hack his parents and sway his father,\" says Önder.</p><p>As the Gezi protests kicked off, the 140journos network grew by six times almost overnight. The grievances of young people all around Turkey streamed through their timeline. Verifying and curating thousands of tweets 24/7, they did not leave his small apartment in Istanbul for days.</p><p>For Turkey's Generation Y, who grew up with the internet, defending the freedom to share information online becomes at least equally, if not more, important than individual politics. <a href=\"http://www.denizergurel.net/internet-in-turkey-2013/\" title=\"\">Just under 50% are online</a> every day. They are often willing to put themselves at personal risk to capture images from the frontline of protests.</p><p>Many are trying to hack a way out of the political crisis closing in on them. The deepening polarisation is intensified by Erdogan's bellicose rhetoric. Generation Y tweets through teargas to expose how absurd the reductive narratives of the political elite are. They poke fun at the dismissive language of government officials. They mock the mainstream media that is complicit in misrepresenting them.</p><p>The country's young protesters do not document their struggle on social media because they are narcissistic millennials. Yes, they want to be visible, but not for likes or pokes or friends; they document their resistance to cultivate social empathy for everyone. They are not a self-affirming group who bury their heads in the sand when violence hits other homes. They are aware that preaching to the young and already-converted, and ignoring the rest of Turkish society out in the analog cold generates a dangerous sense of \"us v them\". They do not want to be portrayed in these divisive terms, which cement their differences. There is no need.</p><p>Cem's father, for example, who used to read just one newspaper, has since become an activist who now encourages young people at protests to send reports to 140journos.</p><p>\"We are just like everyone else,\" says Ali Emre Mazlumoglu, one of the 13 protesters from the \"Ellen selfie in the police van\". \"But what makes us peculiar in the midst of all the pressure and violence is that we can still laugh our way through it all.\" Governed by a prime minister who can't stand political satire in cartoons, or thinks <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/woman-detained-over-gesture-at-turkish-pm-erdogan-claims-misunderstanding.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=63714&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">passersby who give him the middle finger should be detained</a>, young people in Turkey are holding on tight to their mobile phones – and to their sense of humour.</p><p>• This article was amended on 19 March.

Uncovering abandoned sex museums and decrepit amusement parks</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/urban-exploration-robert-macfarlane-bradley-garrett\">Urban exploration</a> has been gaining adepts for a while now, and it seems to be the go-to-hobby for the adventurous souls who need tangible and risky thrills in city environments. Now, the Japanese have given it a name, haikyo, and are taking it to structures such as abandoned amusement parks and old sex museums. <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/12/travel/japan-urban-exploration/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5\">This CNN reportage</a> follows the steps of German Florian Seidel, who has been seeking out and visiting crumbling Japanese infrastructures for five years. He visited two abandoned sex museums which have been deserted for a decade – after the advent of the Internet, he says – but still maintain quite a lot of their charm, so to speak. “The one in Hokkaido he remembers best for the bizarre shooting games and taxidermy animals in sexual positions -- horses and monkeys”, writes Kate Whitehead.

Cities we lost</a></h2><p>This Al-Jazeera article follows the history of cities that were once pan-Mediterranean hubs such as Alexandria and which, in the last century, have been losing a lot of their character though demolition. In the context of political and economic crises in Turkey and Greece or the strife in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere, “why cry over the eradication of an era that is anyway irretrievably extinct?” <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/cities-lost-20143125644720862.html\">asks Iason Athanasiadis</a>. “I believe we should care because the story of how the cosmopolitan era ended allows us to uncover the threads of the narrative that brought us to the current precipice: a largely homogenised region facilitated by the expulsion of minorities and fostering of so-called ‘pure’ Turkish, Greek or Arab nations”, he writes<a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/cities-lost-20143125644720862.html\"></a>. A fascinating read. <br></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/shanghai-community-cubes-included/31093/\">3. Shipping containers reinvented as new homes for Shanghai’s migrant workers </a></h2><p>Many migrant workers in Shanghai have long been living in deplorable conditions – some of them even in homes built out of containers, and for years. While some of these communities <a href=\"http://english.people.com.cn/90882/8178623.html\">have faced relocation</a>, a new container village endorsed by the government and created by a non-profit company is ready to open. Dubbed Community Cube, this two-storey 150 square-metred structure was completed last year and is formed by a number of used shipping containers joined together by metal plates, as reported in Gizmag. These plates can actually be detached, explains <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113037543665572785764/posts\">Adam Williams</a>, “allowing the separate containers to be transported more easily if the migrants need to move on”.<br></p><h2><a href=\"http://cairobserver.com/post/78217823320/7-documentaries-about-life-in-cairo-you-need-to-watch#.UyMflfY2Te7\">4. Seven Cairo documentaries</a></h2><p>While <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2486682/\">The Square</a>, the Oscar-nominated documentary about Tahrir and the Egyptian revolution, might undoubtedly be an interesting watch, it can be difficult to find recent films about Cairo that are about the city itself putting the Arab Spring aside. This <a href=\"http://cairobserver.com/post/78217823320/7-documentaries-about-life-in-cairo-you-need-to-watch#.UyMflfY2Te7\">blogpost</a> by Cairobserver offers recommends seven great films about the Egyptian capital: musical street parties, nightlife, traffic, creativity, the life of rubbish collectors and everything that’s forbidden in Cairo are among the subjects.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26565009\">5. The changing face of Asian cities</a><br></h2><p>It’s hard to keep up with the changes going on in many Asian cities. Some of them have skylines that change drastically every year. Dutch photographer Marcel Heijnen, here <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26565009\">interviewed by the BBC</a>, took to Singapore – where “you blink and there’s a new building”–, Hong Kong and other cities to capture these quickly evolving cityscapes. He explains that he has two habits: one is look out for walls with interesting damage or decay, which “almost look like nature’s coincidental abstract paintings”, and another habit of his is to look for reflections in windows or rain puddles. You can see the results of this combination on <a href=\"http://www.marcelheijnen.com/\">his website</a>. <br><br><b>Thanks for all of your suggestions via email last week.

From the direction of the protesters.\"</p><p>He urged everyone to unite, and underlined that too many parents had suffered already.</p><p>Other witness reports cited in Turkish media have alleged that an angry verbal exchange between \"two opposing groups\" preceded the shooting and that pro-government football fans were involved in the fight on Karamanoglu's side. The police have not confirmed any of these reports. The Guardian was unable to independently verify any of these statements.</p><p>At the funeral – the second burial in two days – hundreds of mourners, many of whom came from the neighbourhood of Karamanoglu's family, carried red carnations and Turkish flags. Angry protesters brandished photos of the killed youth.</p><p>Prior to a series of elections starting this month the rift between the government and the local opposition has widened. Mourners responded with hostility to the foreign press.</p><p>\"We don't want to tell you what happened last night,\" one woman said. \"You, the foreign press, you have done enough damage, we are sick of you.\"</p><p>Other protesters shouted slogans targeting the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP): \"Killer CHP,\" some chanted, and others: \"Killer Kilicdaroglu,\" referring to the party's leader.</p>","headline":"Turkey protests: two more deaths feed growing discontent","trailText":"<p>Police officer has heart attack and young man allegedly shot in head during clashes following funeral of teenage boy</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394738595930/Protesters-attack-a-Turki-006.jpg","wordcount":"487","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-16T19:24:37Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/13/turkey-protest-two-deaths-growing-discontent","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"publication/guardianweekly","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly","type":"publication","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/guardianweekly","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432290911","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394738589640/Protesters-attack-a-Turki-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Demotix/Corbis","photographer":"Ahmed Hadrovic","altText":"Protesters attack a Turkish police van following the funeral of a teenager","height":"54","credit":"Ahmed Hadrovic/Demotix/Corbis","caption":"Protesters in Istanbul attack a Turkish police van following the funeral of a teenager who died nine months after being hit by a police teargas canister.

Hatice's son, Onur, was a talented young architect – a graduate of one of the leading universities. In&nbsp;2010 Onur was taken into custody on suspicion of selling drugs. He was allegedly tortured, verbally and sexually abused and, on his release, put under pressure by police to become an informer. After weeks of anguish the architect jumped from the balcony of his home, ending his life. This month his 57-year-old mother followed suit. The family's efforts to bring the police officers responsible for&nbsp;Orun's death to justice had all come&nbsp;to&nbsp;nought.</p><p>This week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/mar/13/berkin-elvan-funeral-protests-in-turkey-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Turkey also buried Berkin Elvan</a>. The 14-year-old was on his way out to buy bread last year when he was hit in the head by a gas canister fired during a police crackdown on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/tornistan-turkey-animated-film-gezi-park\" title=\"\">anti-government protesters in Gezi park</a>. After months in a coma, he became the eighth victim of the brutality used by police to put down last year's unrest.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out for Berkin's funeral but the police used teargas and water cannon on the mourners. So his death has brought a wave of new protests and clashes across the country. Two people died in the trouble on Wednesday night. As&nbsp;the film director Umit Unal tweeted of the vicious spiral of violence and grief: \"Living in this country has turned into an agonising futility.\"</p><p>While Turkey's mainstream papers and TV channels are reluctant to give full coverage to these tragedies, the internet is awash with public anger. Via YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, Turkey's young, urban population are increasingly voicing their discontent and frustration. An irreversible transformation is taking place as corruption scandals involving government officials, businessmen, and even prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his family are&nbsp;brought to light.</p><p>Every day a new tape recording is leaked, usually in the evening when internet use is at its peak. Millions of people, instead of going out to movies or to eat with friends, turn on their computers and go online to learn about the latest scandal. Both Erdogan's supporters and opponents agree that the&nbsp;AK&nbsp;party is facing its biggest challenge in&nbsp;11 years of power.</p><p>Among the leaks was a tape that allegedly involved the prime minister talking to his son about meddling in elections for the chairmanship of Fenerbahce, one of the top football clubs. In another tape, Erdogan is heard discussing the continuing trial of media giant Dogan with the justice minister. Erdogan has not only confirmed but defended the conversation, saying it was natural for him to follow the matter, even though it is being seen as interfering with the judicial process.</p><p>If the tapes are shocking, the way in which they have been obtained is also problematic. It is now claimed that officers close to the Gulen movement, inspired by US-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-turkey-gulen-idUSBREA291SL20140310\" title=\"\">Erdogan's chief adversary</a>, have secretly and illegally tapped thousands of phones, and recorded thousands of conversations over the years. Pro-government newspapers are&nbsp;publishing details of the tapping, which in itself is another scandal.</p><p>Erdogan and Gulen, allies in past battles against the Turkish military, are now embroiled in an epic feud. It first surfaced in 2010 after Gulen attacked Erdogan's handling of the Gaza aid flotilla crisis, but Erdogan now blames Gulen for whipping up an anti-government plot. Already divided between conservatives and secularists, Turkey is facing yet another polarisation. But Turks themselves are increasingly tiring of this battle of wills. People&nbsp;from different ideological and cultural backgrounds are now united in&nbsp;profound distrust of their rulers.</p><p>From childhood, Turks learn to hold&nbsp;the state in high esteem, so much so that some people even name their children \"Devlet\"– state. Respect for the state today is the lowest it has ever&nbsp;been. As the power struggle rages,&nbsp;the people of Turkey feel betrayed&nbsp;and forsaken. When elephants&nbsp;fight it is the grass that suffers. Whichever side wins, Turkey's democracy is already a casualty.</p>","headline":"Whoever wins Turkey's power struggle, democracy is already a casualty","trailText":"<strong>Elif Shafak:</strong> With mainstream media reluctant to cover it, the unfolding turmoil is being played out on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394725980372/People-protesting-about-t-008.jpg","wordcount":"645","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-16T16:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/turkey-democracy-power-struggle-democracy-youtube-facebook-twitter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/turkey-democracy-power-struggle-democracy-youtube-facebook-twitter","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/elif-shafak","webTitle":"Elif Shafak","r2ContributorId":"43358","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/21/1300711935444/Elif.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Elif Shafak is an award-winning novelist.

Sometimes it feels like the calm before a storm. Can you believe that you can make an animated documentary – which is exactly showing the truth – as an artist and you can be afraid of what you are doing?” </p><p>The hand-drawn film evokes the style of French director Sylvain Chomet.<br></p><p>Kartal also shines a light on the lack of interest of animation as a culture of expression in Turkey. “People still think that animation is only for children, or that it is something that makes you laugh while watching TV.

year when he was hit by a teargas cartridge during anti-government protests in Istanbul","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Fresh clashes between Turkish police and protesters have erupted in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara on Tuesday , after a 15-year-old boy died from a head injury sustained during anti-government protests last summer.</p><p>Berkin Elvan, then aged 14, was on his way to buy bread for his family when he got caught up in the street battles in Istanbul last June. He was hit in the head by a teargas cartridge fired by the police and had been in a coma ever since.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, police fired teargas to disperse protesters gathered outside the Istanbul hospital where Berkin died, after some people started throwing objects at an armoured police vehicle.</p><p>In Ankara, riot police used water cannon and teargas against a crowd of about 2,000 who blocked a highway to mourn the teenager's death and to contest continued police impunity. In several cities, there were sit-ins and silent protests.</p><p>According to doctors, Berkin's health had deteriorated gravely and his weight had dropped to 16kg (two and a half stone) in recent weeks.</p><p>Announcing his death on Twitter, Berkin's parents wrote: \"To our people: We lost our son Berkin Elvan at 7am this morning. Condolences to us all.\" Gülsüm Elvan, the boy's mother, expressed her anger towards the Turkish government: \"Not God took my son away, but [Prime Minister Recep] Tayyip Erdoğan,\" she said, according to the Turkish press.</p><p>President Abdullah Gül, who was the first senior politician to inquire after the teenager's health on Monday, publicly extended his condolences towards the family this morning.</p><p>\"He was only 14 when the incident happened. I share the family's sorrow,\" Gül said.</p><p>Istanbul governor Hüseyin Avni Mutlu's expression of regret at the \"loss\" on Twitter was met with outrage on social media. \"We did not 'lose' Berkin; you killed him,\" several people tweeted.</p><p>Throughout last June, hundreds of thousands took to the streets when an environmental protest aimed at saving an inner city park snowballed into a nationwide display of anger at Erdoğan's increasingly authoritarian stance.</p><p>The teenager's death raises the number of deaths from last summer's protests to seven, at least four directly resulting from police violence. Turkish police have been accused of using excessive force against the protesters in Istanbul's Gezi Park and in demonstrations that spread all over the country.</p><p>According to the Turkish Medical Association, about 8,000 people were injured as a result of the police's heavy-handed interventions: 104 sustained serious head injuries and 11 lost an eye, mostly after being hit by plastic bullets fired by the police.</p><p>Rights groups have repeatedly condemned the use of excessive police violence during the protests. A Human Rights Watch dispatch published on Tuesday stressed that the firing of teargas directly at protesters violated international legal standards.</p><p>\"The case of Berkin Elvan has become a symbol for Turkey's record of police violence and impunity,\" said Emma Sinclair-Webb, a senior Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch.</p><p>\"The enormous outpouring of anger at these horrors is also due to the silence of the government on Berkin Elvan's death and on this issue in general.\"</p>","headline":"Turkish police fire teargas to quell protests after boy, 15, dies","trailText":"Berkin Elvan has been in coma since June last year when he was hit by a teargas cartridge during anti-government protests in Istanbul","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394558958267/Berkin-Elvan-coffin-006.jpg","wordcount":"497","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-14T17:34:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/turkish-police-teargas-protests-boy-15-dies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/11/turkish-police-teargas-protests-boy-15-dies","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431829864","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/11/1394558949539/Berkin-Elvan-coffin-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Emrah Gurel","altText":"Berkin Elvan coffin","height":"54","credit":"Emrah Gurel/AP","caption":"The coffin of Berkin Elvan is carried through Istanbul.

A second contract to build a helicopter landing dock went to a Turkish-Spanish joint venture. The national warship project had initially favoured wholly domestic, private-sector producers.</p><p>Erdogan has publicly signalled a dislike for Koc Holding, suggesting that the company, whose output accounts for about 10% of the economy, has meddled in politics. Koc and its subsidiaries have faced a series of fines, lawsuits and tax audits in recent years.</p><p>Koc could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Erdogan's office has declined to comment on the latest recordings.</p><p>Another voice recording, posted late on Monday, purports to be of Erdogan urging his justice minister to speed up a court case against Aydin Dogan, head of a family-run conglomerate seen as part of a secular elite which has had an often tense relationship with his Islamist-rooted government.</p><p>Dogan said in a statement carried by its newspaper Hurriyet that the conversation, if true, would mark a \"clear interference in the judicial process\" that it said risked shaking trust in the rule of law in Turkey. Erdogan's office declined to comment.</p><p>Government officials say Gulen's Hizmet network has been illegally tapping thousands of telephones in Turkey for years to concoct criminal cases against its enemies and try to influence government affairs. Gulen has denied the accusations.</p><p>At Tuesday's rally in the AK party's conservative heartland – the men and the mostly headscarved women stood separately – there was no sign of any wavering in support for Erdogan as he battles the biggest challenge to his 11-year rule.</p><p>\"I believe there is corruption, but look at how much Turkey has progressed under the AK party.

After the talks, following the usual procedure, members of the occupation who had their number drawn came to the front to speak to the 10,000 people present. One man in particular was shaking and trembling with evident symptoms of stagefright before his address. He then proceeded to give a beautiful talk in perfectly formed sentences and paragraphs, presenting a complete and persuasive plan for the future of the movement.</p><p>\"How did you do it?\" I asked him later. \"I thought you were going to collapse.\"</p><p>\"When I started speaking,\" he replied nonchalantly, \"I was mouthing the words but someone else was speaking. A stranger inside me was dictating what to say.\"</p><p>Many participants in the recent insurrections and revolts make similar statements. My recent work addresses this stranger in me (a usual description of the unconscious), this miraculous transubstantiation shared by people in different parts of the world. [1]</p><p>The new world order announced in 1989 was the shortest in history, coming to an abrupt end in 2008.  Protests, riots and uprisings have erupted all over the world. Neither the mainstream nor the radicals had predicted the wave and this led to a frantic search for historical precedents. A former director of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service thought it, \"a revolutionary wave, like 1848\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\" title=\"\">Paul Mason</a> agrees: \"There are strong parallels – above all with 1848, and with the wave of discontent that preceded 1914.' [2] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/may/18/alain-badiou-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Alain Badiou</a> suspects a possible \"rebirth of history\" in a new age of \"riots and uprisings\" after a long revolutionary \"interval\".[3] Eventually, however, history is miscarried or stillborn and Badiou strongly disagrees with my statement that we have entered an age or resistance.</p><p>At a conference in Paris in January 2013, I was on the same panel as Badiou. After my presentation, Alain started: \"I certainly admire the eloquence of my friend and comrade Costas Douzinas, who has buttressed his avowed optimism with precise references to what he takes to be the political novelties of the people's resistance in Greece, where he has even discerned the emergence of a new political subject.\" When I heard the next point I thought I had misunderstood: While the courage and inventiveness of the resistance is a cause of enthusiasm, it is neither novel nor effective. The same things happened in May '68, in Tahrir Square and even \"in the times of Spartacus or Thomas Munzer\". [4]</p><p>I plead guilty to the indictment of avowed optimism. We have entered an age of resistance. New forms, strategies and subjects of resistance and insurrection appear regularly without knowledge of or guidance from Alain Badiou, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/slavojzizek\" title=\"\">Slavoj Žižek</a> or <a href=\"http://www.egs.edu/faculty/antonio-negri/biography/\" title=\"\">Antonio Negri</a>. Their timing is unpredictable, but their occurrence certain. As resistances spread around the world, from the austerity-hit countries to Turkey and Brazil, the former poster boys of neo-liberalism, to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ukraine, philosophy has the responsibility to explore the contemporary return of resistance and to develop an analytics of resistance.</p><p>In a more strategic sense, it is importance to follow Kant's advice in his late political essays, something of a vote of confidence for philosophical public relations <em>avant la lettre</em>. In Kant's philosophy of history, nature guarantees the eventual civil union of humanity in a cosmopolitan future. But given the chance of a public hearing, the philosopher must keep preaching the inevitability of cosmopolitanism, offering a helping hand to providence. In a similar fashion and after the repeated claims about the \"end of history\", the \"end of ideology\" and the new world order, it is important for the left to proclaim that radical change has become possible again.</p><p>In the 20th century, the left collected a long list of prophets and groupuscules promising the re-foundation of the one and only or the correct communist organisation. In earlier interventions, Badiou explained that the \"resistance\" (in ironic quotation marks) of the anti-globalisation movement was a creation of power. The movement is \"a wild operator\" of globalisation and \"seeks to sketch out, for the imminent future, the forms of comfort to be enjoyed by our planet's idle petite bourgeoisie\". [5]</p><p>Warming to the theme, Badiou proceeded to attack Negri (\"a backward romantic\") who is fascinated by capital's \"flexibility and violence\". He called the multitude a \"dreamy hallucination\", which claims the right for our \"planet's idle … to enjoy without doing anything, while taking special care to avoid any form of discipline, whereas we know that discipline, in all fields, is the key to truths\".</p><p>Finally, he dismissed the category of the \"movement\" because it is \"coupled to the logic of the state\"; politics must construct \"new forms of discipline to replace the discipline of political parties\".[6]</p><p>According to this version, the communist resistance should stay away from the state, adopt the idea of communism and create a highly disciplined organisation which acts towards the people in a directive and authoritarian manner. It \"wants to celebrate its own dictatorial authority, dictatorial because democratic ad infinitum\".[7]</p><p>This is the type of organisation that recent resistances rejected and with good cause: both because of the history of the left and, more importantly, because the socio-economic changes of late capitalism have made the concept of a Leninist organisation not just redundant but undesirable and counterproductive.</p><p>From a totally different if not opposed perspective and with greater interest in the pleasure principle than the death drive (and in parties than in the party), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/07/resistance-philosophy-defiance-howard-caygill-review\" title=\"\">Howard Caygill's recent book</a> seems to share the pessimism.[8] Its last lines refer to contemporary resistances and conclude: \"Resistance is engaged in defiant delegitimisation of existing and potential domination but without any prospect of a final outcome in the guise of a revolutionary or reformist result or solution … The politics of resistance is disillusioned and without end.\"</p><p>But despite the reservations of the pessimists, resistance and revolution are in the air. It looks however as if Hegel's \"owl of Minerva\" has not left its nest. Is this because we are not at \"dusk\" yet? In other words, the philosophers cannot respond to the political and social upheaval because the epoch of resistance is not close to ending, as Hegel thought? Or, is it the result of a certain theoretical and political sclerosis on the part of theoretical radicals?</p><p>Failure, defeat, persecution and the attendant paranoia are marks of the left. The left has learned to be under attack, to fail, to lose and wallow in the defeat. An enduring masochism lurks in the best leftist books: many are stories of failure and variable rationalisation. It is true that the left has lost a lot: a united analysis and movement, the working class as political subject, the inexorable forward movement of history, planned economy as an alternative to capitalism.</p><p>It is also true that the falling masonry of the Berlin wall hit western socialists more than the old Stalinists. Using Freud's terms, the necessary and liberating mourning for the love object of revolution has turned into permanent melancholy. In mourning, the libido finally withdraws from the lost object and is displaced on to another. In melancholy, it \"withdraws into the ego\". This withdrawal serves to \"establish an identification of the ego with the abandoned object\".[9]</p><p>Walter Benjamin has called this \"left melancholy\": the attitude of the militant who is attached more to a particular political analysis or ideal – and to the failure of that ideal – than to seizing possibilities for radical change in the present.[10] For his part, Benjamin calls upon the left to grasp the \"time of the now\", while for the melancholic, history is an \"empty time\" of repetition. Part of the left is narcissistically fixed to its lost object with no obvious desire to abandon it. Left melancholy leads inexorably to the fetishism of small differences: politically, it appears in the interminable conflicts, splits and vituperation among erstwhile comrades. Attacks on the closest, the threatening double, are more vicious than those on the enemy. Theoretically, according to Benjamin, left melancholy betrays the world for the sake of knowledge. In our contemporary setting, we have a return to a particular type of grand theory, which combines an obsession with the explanation of life, the universe and everything with the anxiety of influence. The shadows and ghosts of the previous generation of greats weigh down on the latest missionaries of the encyclopaedia.</p><p>The most important reason why radical theory has been unable to fully comprehend recent resistances is perhaps  the \"anxiety of the grand narrative\". A previous generation of radical intellectuals – such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, Edward Thompson and Louis Althusser – had close links with the movements of their time. Contemporary radical philosophers are found more often in lecture rooms than street corners.</p><p>The wider \"academisation\" of radical theory and its close proximity with \"interdisciplinary\" and cultural studies departments has changed its character. These academic fields have been developed as a result of university funding priorities. They happily welcome the appeal of radical philosophers contributing to their celebrity value. But this weakening of the link between practice and theory has an adverse effect on theory construction. The desire for a \"radical theory of everything\" caused by the \"anxiety of influence\" created by the previous generation of philosophical greats does not help overcome the limitations of disembodied abstraction.</p><p>It is no surprise that many European leftists are happy to celebrate the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Hugo Chavez</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/evo-morales\" title=\"\">Evo Morales</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/rafael-correa\" title=\"\">Rafael Correa</a> and to carry out radical politics by proxy, while ready to dismiss what happens in our part of the world as irrelevant or misguided. It may feel better to lose gloriously than to win, even with a few compromises.</p><p>Repeated defeats do not help the millions whose lives have been devastated by neoliberal capitalism and post-democratic governance. What the left needs is not a new model party or an all-encompassing brilliant theory. It needs to learn from the popular resistances that broke out without leaders, parties or common ideology and to build on the energy, imagination and novel institutions created. The left needs a few successes after a long interval of failures.</p><p>Greece is perhaps the best chance for the European left. The persistent and militant resistances sank two austerity governments and currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/12/europe-left-capitalism-social-democrats-reforms\" title=\"\">Syriza</a>, the radical left coalition, is likely to be the first elected radical government in Europe. The historical chance has been created not by party or theory but by ordinary people who are well ahead of both and adopted this small protest party as the vehicle that would complement in parliament the fights in the streets. The political and intellectual responsibility of radical intellectuals everywhere is to stand in solidarity with the Greek left.</p><p>For an older generation of militants, theory is a weapon in politics. From this perspective, I have argued in <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745665438.html\" title=\"\">my recent book</a> that forms, subjects and strategies of resistance emerge within and against the circuits of power, reacting and rearranging its operations. To explain their multiplication and intensification, we must start with an exploration of the state of affairs they stand up to, the disastrous combination of neoliberal capitalism and the almost terminal decay of parliamentary democracy. All recent resistances from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jan/25/clashes-cairo-third-anniversary-tahrir-square-uprising-video\" title=\"\">Tahrir</a>, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/syntagma-square\" title=\"\">Syntagma</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/03/taksim-square-istanbul-turkey-protest\" title=\"\">Taksim</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/12/sarajevo-anti-government-niksic-elections-bosnia-herzegovina\" title=\"\">Sarajevo</a> seem to respond to one or the other and usually both. It is therefore important to start the analysis of the age of resistance with an examination of certain common trends. Let me summarise them.</p><p>First, the economic and social landscape of immaterial neoliberal capitalism. Its logic is privatising and anti-state, de-territorialising. But at the same time, however, as profit becomes rent and interest, capitalism calls for increased regulation and policing.</p><p>Second, we must explore the global bio-political organisation with its two sides: in a period of fake growth, personal libertarianism, hedonism and consumerism, the injunction to mandatory pleasure. Every \"I desire X\" has become \"I have a right to X\". When austerity inescapably arrives, the emphasis flips on to its reverse side, the controlling of populations. Individual happiness and choice, all the rage in the previous period, disappears. The individual is abandoned, mandatory pleasure becomes the prohibition of pleasure in order to save the DNA of the nation.</p><p>These developments have serious effects for the politics of law. Legality is used by the elites in order to prevent and criminalise disobedience and resistance. The previous emphasis on controlled freedom turns into a limited state of exception, police repression and widespread exclusion.</p><p>Global analysis must always be adjusted to the local context. Resistances are always locally situated. Each case, therefore, must be examined in the context of local histories, conditions, the spatially and temporally located balance of power. The explosion, multiplication and condensation of different struggles and campaigns depends crucially on the kairos, the timely moment and often a random catalyst, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/13/athens-greece-riots\" title=\"\">the death of Alexis Grigoropoulos</a> in Athens in 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/tunisian-fruit-seller-mohammed-bouazizi\" title=\"\">Mohamed Bouazizi</a> in Tunisia in 2010, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/mark-duggan-profile-tottenham-shooting\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a> in London, 2011.</p><p>A spontaneous insurrection is the point where the complementarity or coupling of promised freedom of consumer choice with behavioural control and police repression unravels. The first site of conflict is, therefore, de- and resubjectification, the disarticulation of people from the position of desiring and consuming machines and their emergence as resisting subjectivities (the \"stranger in me\"). The stake in most struggles is the repoliticisation of politics by introducing an active element of direct democracy into our ailing and ageing constitutional arrangements.</p><p>Three new forms of politics have emerged, responding to the tendencies and subjectivities of late capitalism. First, the expendable, redundant humans, the <em>homines sacri</em> of our world. Such are the undocumented or <em>sans papiers</em> immigrants, those for whom the Mediterranean has become a floating graveyard. Here, resisting subjectivity often takes the form of martyrdom – witnessing and sacrifice – and of exodus.</p><p>Second, the bio-politically excluded: the unemployed and unemployable, young and old, people who exist socially but are invisible to the political system. Resistance takes the form of insurrection, occasionally rioting. Subjectivity takes the form of violent acting out. What they demand is not this or that right, so much as the \"right to have rights\", to be considered part of the social contract.</p><p>Finally, democratic disenfranchisement. Here the dominant form is the occupation of squares and other public spaces by multitudes of men and women of all ideologies, ages, occupations and the many unemployed. Immaterial production promotes networking but not political co-operation, communication but not ideological identities, collaboration based on atomisation and self-interest. The occupied squares are the place where the dissidents put into political practice the skills of networking and collaboration we have learnt for work. Young people were told for 30 years that they would get a good life, if they study, get degrees, keep learning new skills. Over 60% of European youth have post-secondary education and exactly the same skills as their rulers. They are now the precariat. One thousand unemployed lawyers, engineers and doctors are more revolutionary than one thousand unemployed workers. These are the indignados of Tahrir Squre, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/may/20/spain-protest\" title=\"\">Puerta del Sol</a>, Syntagma and Taksim.</p><p>Elaborate working groups provide essential services in the occupied squares. In Athens, for example, food, health, cultural and educational activities and media presence were provided by professionals, many with higher degrees but permanently unemployed. The daily and thematic assemblies, as well as the working groups, organise themselves under a strict axiom of equality. Whoever is in the square, everyone and anyone, is entitled to an equal share of time to put across his views. The views of the unemployed and the university professor are given equal time, discussed with equal vigour and put to the vote for adoption. Here the right to resistance joins equality, the second great revolutionary right, and changes it from a conditioned norm into an unconditional axiom: people are free and equal; each counts as one in all relevant groups.[11]</p><p>The occupied squares create a constituent counter-power, which splits the social space between \"us\" and \"them\". Their direct democracy both parodies representative institutions by providing efficiently the services currently privatised and also prefigures a new constitutional and institutional architecture.</p><p>Let me conclude by offering seven theses towards an analytics of resistance:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Resistance is a law of being. It is internal to its object. From the moment being takes form, or a power asymmetry is established, it encounters resistances which irreversibly twist and fissure it.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Resistance is always situated. Resistances are local and multiple: they emerge concretely in specific conditions, responding to a situation, state of affairs or event.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Resistance is a mixture of reaction and action, negation and affirmation. Reactive resistance conserves and restores the state of things. The active borrows, mimics and subverts the adversary's arms in order to invent new rules, institutions, situations.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Resistance is a process or experience of subjectivisation. We become new subjects, the \"stranger in me emerges\" when we experience a split in identity. Because my particular existence has failed, because identity is split and cannot be completed, I pass from daily routine identity to the universality of resistance. It  involves risk and perseverance: resistance is the courage of freedom.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Resistance is first a fact, not an obligation. It is not the idea or the theory of justice or communism that leads to resistance, but the sense of injustice, the bodily reaction to hurt, hunger, despair. The idea of justice and equality are maintained or lost as a result of the existence and extent of resistance, not the other way around.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Resistance becomes political and may succeed in radically changing the balance of forces, if it becomes collective and condenses, temporarily or permanently, a number of causes, a multiplicity of struggles and local and regional grievances, bringing them all together in a common central place and time.</p><p>Persistence, encampment, staying on in a public place and turning it into the agora or the forum may help to create the demos in its opposition to the elites. At that (unpredictable) point, resistance may become the hegemonic force. This has happened in a few places in the last few years. The possible betrayal of the revolution later does not change the fact that people in the streets have learned that they may overthrow the strongest of rulers.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> While resistance is a fact not an obligation, the subject of resistance emerges through the exercise of the right to resist, the oldest, indeed the only natural right. Right has two metaphysical sources. As recognised will, right accepts the order of things and dresses the dominant particular with the mantle of the universal. But as a will that wills what does not exist, right finds its force in itself and its effect in an open cosmos that cannot be fully determined by (financial, political or military) might. The resisting will forms an agonistic universality created by a diagonal division of the social world, which separates rulers from the ruled and the excluded.</p><p></p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p>[1] Costas Douzinas, Philosophy and Resistance in the Crisis (Polity, 2013).</p><p>[2] Paul Mason, Why it's Kicking off Everywhere: The New Global Revolutions (London, Verso, 2012), 65.</p><p>[3] Alain Badiou, The Rebirth of History: Times of Riots and Uprisings (London, Verso, 2012), 38.</p><p>[4] Alain Badiou, 'Our Contemporary Impotence', 181 Radical Philosophy, September-October 2013, 43.</p><p>[5] Alain Badiou, 'Beyond Formalisation', An Interview conducted by Pater Hallward and Bruno Bosteels (Paris, July, 2 2002) in Bruno Bosteels, Badiou and Politics (Durham, Duke University Press, 2011), 318-350.</p><p>[6] id., 336, 337.</p><p>[7] The rebirth of history, 97.</p><p>[8] Howard Caygill, On Resistance: A Philosophy of Defiance' (Bloomsbury, 2013), 208.</p><p>[9] Sigmund Freud, 'Mourning and Melancholia', in Vol. 14, The Standard Edition of the Complete Works of Sigmund Freud, (Hogarth, 1957), 249.</p><p>[10] Walter Benjamin, \"Left-Wing Melancholy,\" in The Weimar Republic Sourcebook, ed.

Women now make up 10% of the global super-rich.</p><p>Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, with a personal fortune worth more than $1bn (£600m), becomes one of the highest-profile new entrants to the Forbes list, joining Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard as the only other female tech billionaire.</p><p>Nigeria's first female billionaire, businesswoman Folorunsho Alakija, is also making her Forbes debut. Born into a wealthy family, she studied fashion in London before going into the oil business in 1993. Her stake in Famfa Oil provides the bulk of her $2.5bn fortune.</p><p>According to Forbes, a record number of 42 women broke into the list for the first time, although only 32 female billionaires (1.9% of the total) built their own fortune, rather than inheriting it from a parent or husband.</p><p>The world's richest woman is Christy Walton, who shares a $36.7bn chunk of the Walmart fortune, edging out one of L'Oréal's principal shareholders, Liliane Bettencourt.</p><p>One of the top UK entrants is Denise Coates, the British online gambling queen who, along with her brother, owns Bet365. Coates was at school when she started working as a cashier in her father's betting shops and has amassed $1.6bn in personal wealth.</p><p>Fiercely private, she has escaped almost all press attention in the UK despite Bet365 taking almost £20bn in bets and making £150m in profits in the year to March 2013.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/08/denise-coates-woman-bet365-gambling\" title=\"\">a rare interview two years ago</a>, Coates told the Guardian how she has, on occasion, had to correct some people who had assumed that her father, a well-known businessman, ran the company.</p><p>Her business, which employs 2,500 workers, mostly in Stoke-on-Trent, made a £150m profit last year,  even after swallowing £31m of losses from Bet365's controlling interest in Stoke City football club</p><p>Coates, who owns half the business, received pay and bonuses of £5.4m, as well as her share of £15m in dividends. Even after these payouts the company had a further £430m in cash reserves on the balance sheet. In the past five years, Bet365 has paid out dividends totalling £130m.</p><p>A total of nine women feature in the top 85 - two having joined since Oxfam analysis in January showed that t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/oxfam-85-richest-people-half-of-the-world\" title=\"\">he world's richest 85 people have $1 trillion - as much as the poorest half of the world's 7 billion population.</a></p><p>Bill Gates reclaimed his crown as the world's richest man, after a surge in the value of Microsoft shares increased his wealth by $9bn to $76bn. Mexican telecoms mogul Carlos Slim, who held the title for the previous four years, was nudged into second place with a fortune of $72bn. The Spanish clothing tycoon Amancio Ortega, behind fast fashion chain Zara, stayed in third place, extending his lead over investor Warren Buffett at four.</p><p>The biggest riser was Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune almost doubled to $28.bn, as shares in the social network soared. He is joined by other tech wizards, with Dropbox chief executive, Drew Houston, and WhatsApp founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, making the list for the first time. The last-minute entry for Koum and Acton comes after Facebook announced it would pay $19bn for the messaging app - a sweet deal for Acton, who was rejected for a job with Facebook in 2009.</p><p>The richest Briton remains the Duke of Westminster, whose Grosvenor property company owns a swathe of Belgravia and Knightsbridge, as well as tens of thousands of acres in Cambridge, Liverpool and Scotland. London's surging property market also boosted the fortunes of the billionaire Reuben brothers – the second richest Britons –  and the fourth richest, Charles Cadogan,  a former banker who inherited his family's centuries-old holdings in Knightsbridge and Chelsea.  Shopping was one of the other mainsprings of UK wealth: Mike Ashley, the reclusive founder of Sports Direct, is Britain's fifth richest person, with clothing tycoon Sir Philip Green and his wife Cristina, not far behind in seventh.</p><p>The US has by far the largest number of billionaires, with China in second place with a record 152, up from 122 last year.  China's richest man Wang Jianlin, who grew up in poverty during the Cultural Revolution to amass a fortune in department stores, cinemas and five-star hotels, is now extending his interests in the UK with the recent acquisition of luxury Sunseeker yachts.</p><p>But other emerging economies, buffeted by turbulence on currency markets, saw their super-wealthy fall out of the Forbes list. Turkey lost 19 billionaires to inflation and the falling value of its stock market, while Indonesia saw eight of its wealthy drop out of the list, after its currency plummeted 20% against the dollar. But 2013 will be remembered as a good year for the world's super-rich, who now have collective wealth of $6.4tn, up from $5.4 tn the previous year.</p>","headline":"Record number of women make 28th

Turkey, Ukraine, Thailand, Venezuela and Bosnia-Herzegovina are all middle-income democracies with elected leaders besieged by people angry at misgovernment, corruption and economic sclerosis. These days it is no longer just dictators who have something to fear from the crowd.</p><p>The belief that violently propelled revolutionary change is transnational, even universal in nature, and uniform in origin and aspiration, is seductive, persistent and historically absurd. Its antecedents include the lost era of Marx and Lenin when the \"workers of the world\" espoused the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p><p>Wordsworth's <a href=\"[http://www.poemhunter.com/william-wordsworth/quotations/page-20/?search=]\" title=\"\">joyful reaction to the French revolution</a> – \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very Heaven!\" – , which he fondly believed threatened the <em>ancien regime</em> across all Europe, shows how lasting, powerful – and illusory – is the idea of ubiquitous, socially-levelling, personally liberating rebellion.</p><p>Following this deceptive formula, the revolts that roiled the Arab world, starting in Tunisia in 2010, were initially lumped together under the optimistic tag of the Arab spring. This phrase is not often heard nowadays. The supposed pan-Arab battle for freedom and democracy, as it was wishfully interpreted in the west, mutated into a string of separately defined conflicts involving violent coup and counter-coup in Egypt, national fracturing in Libya, harsh repression in Bahrain and catastrophic civil war in Syria.</p><p>In democracies in revolt, the differences are similarly instructive. Ukraine's uprising is increasingly taking on an ethnic tinge. The nationalist west against the ethnically Russian east. In Thailand, the principal animus is old-fashioned class warfare, pitting relatively well-to-do middle-class city dwellers against the subsidised rural masses. In Turkey, the primary focus of the protesters' rage has been one man, the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.</p><p>\"While mayor of Istanbul, Erdoğan quipped that democracy was like a street car: 'You ride it as far as you need and then you get off.' He has proven himself a man of his word, as he has moved to consolidate power, eviscerate the judiciary, crush free speech, curb the media and imprison political opponents,\" <a href=\"http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2014/02/24/do-turks-want-democracy/\" title=\"\">said commentator Michael Rubin</a>.</p><p>Seen this way, Erdoğan appeared not so much a lesser version of Ukraine's Viktor Yanukovych - he has not, so far, resorted to shooting demonstrators - and more the Euro-Asian equivalent of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, who also stands accused of trampling civic freedoms. As in Thailand, Maduro's most vehement critics hail from the middle class who revile <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/article/1393351308/how-socialism-has-destroyed-venezuela\" title=\"\">the so-called Bolivarian socialist revolution</a> of his mentor, the late Hugo Chávez.</p><p>As in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/opinion/democracy-in-peril-in-asia.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=3\" title=\"\">Cambodia and Bangladesh, two other restless nations</a>,  a rapidly deteriorating economy, food prices and high crime rates are also key elements in unrest in Venezuela, said analyst Juan Carlos Hidalgo. \"Despite receiving over $1tn in oil revenues since 1999, the government has run out of cash and now relies heavily on printing money to finance itself. The result is the highest inflation rate in the world.\"  <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-02-25/venezuela-is-no-ukraine\" title=\"\">Venezuela is, however, no Ukraine</a>, other analysts say.</p><p>Another common denominator may be the peculiar position these countries occupy in the list of nations by wealth. Venezuela had a per capita GDP of $13,480 (£8,080) in 2012, placing it 73rd on the IMF's list. Turkey was 68th, with $14,812. Thailand was 92nd, Ukraine 106th. Although not exactly wealthy, groups who might be termed upwardly-mobile revolutionaries can afford the luxury of protest in a way previous generations in these countries could not.</p><p>A mismanaged economy, corrupt privatisations, high youth unemployment and croneyism among the ruling elites also lay behind the recent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/12/sarajevo-anti-government-niksic-elections-bosnia-herzegovina\" title=\"\">sudden eruption of violent protest</a> in Bosnia. In this case, there was evident crossover with Turkey, and as in Bangkok, many Sarajevo residents have clearly lost confidence in their complex postwar political system. Despite its recent history, however, Bosnia's current grievances are economic, not ethnic.</p><p>\"When Bosnia abandoned communism about two decades ago, officials devised a plan to privatise state-owned companies in a way they hoped would avoid mass layoffs for state workers,\" <a href=\"http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2014/02/12/bosnias_failed_privatizations_play_key_role_in_unrest.html\" title=\"\">wrote Aida Cerkez</a>.</p><p>\"More than 80% of privatisations have failed. Many well-connected tycoons have swept into these companies, stripping them of their assets, declaring bankruptcy and leaving thousands without jobs or with minimal pay.\" Hence the anger on the streets.</p><p>Ineffective, undeveloped or non-existent institutions, misgovernance, deteriorating economic performance, failing social cohesion, the alienation of younger generations, ethnic and nationalist tensions and a lack of faith in democratic processes – these are among the common factors sparking the rebellions of 2014.</p><p>No one country or revolution is typical, but given these criteria, it is not hard to predict where unrest may next break out. <a href=\"http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2014/02/19/argentinas_downward_spiral.html\" title=\"\">Argentina is a prime candidate for trouble</a> under the divisive, leftist leadership of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.  Her increasingly anti-democratic stance, her government's corruption scandals and her efforts to deflect attention by picking fights with Britain over the Falkland s are ominous. Experience elsewhere suggests an economy in freefall and overseen by a nationalist demagogue is a recipe for revolt.</p>","headline":"Recipe for revolt: what do Ukraine, Turkey and Thailand have in

He was hit in the head by a teargas cartridge fired by the police and had been in a coma ever since.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, police fired teargas to disperse protesters gathered outside the Istanbul hospital where Berkin died, after some people started throwing objects at an armoured police vehicle.</p><p>In Ankara, riot police used water cannon and teargas against a crowd of about 2,000 who blocked a highway to mourn the teenager's death and to contest continued police impunity. In several cities, there were sit-ins and silent protests.</p><p>According to doctors, Berkin's health had deteriorated gravely and his weight had dropped to 16kg (two and a half stone) in recent weeks.</p><p>Announcing his death on Twitter, Berkin's parents wrote: \"To our people: We lost our son Berkin Elvan at 7am this morning. Condolences to us all.\" Gülsüm Elvan, the boy's mother, expressed her anger towards the Turkish government: \"Not God took my son away, but [Prime Minister Recep] Tayyip Erdoğan,\" she said, according to the Turkish press.</p><p>President Abdullah Gül, who was the first senior politician to inquire after the teenager's health on Monday, publicly extended his condolences towards the family this morning.</p><p>\"He was only 14 when the incident happened.

If we bow to this, we will be doing injustice to all coming prime ministers and ministers.\"</p><p>In the recording, a man alleged to be Erdogan tells his son to dispose of tens of millions as investigators are searching the homes of relatives of three cabinet ministers \"for a big corruption operation\".</p><p>\"OK, so what I am saying is, get all that stuff in your house out. OK?\" he says.</p><p>A voice alleged to be that of his son, Billal replies: \"Dad, could that be? There is your money in the safe.\" The older man's voice responds: \"That's what I mean.\"</p><p>Later, the person alleged to be the prime minister asks: \"Did you make most of it vanish?\" He is answered: \"We haven't been able to do all of it yet. There are about 30m euros left. We haven't been able to get that out yet.\"</p><p>Erdogan described the recordings as \"blackmail, being spread via Twitter\".</p><p>But he admitted his phone had been tapped in what he called \"Turkey's biggest eavesdropping scandal of all times\".</p><p>Pro-government newspapers have claimed that thousands of government officials, academics, business people and journalists have been listened to illegally. It has been impossible to verify the authenticity of the recordings, which first appeared on YouTube but quickly spread across social media sites. Even so, they are likely to inflict a painful political blow.</p><p>The alleged conversation is said to have taken place on 17 December last year – a day on which police conducted a series of surprise raids that resulted in the arrest of the sons of three government ministers and several high-profile businessmen.</p><p>Since December, Erdogan has removed or fired the key people involved in these investigations, reappointed thousands of police officials and prosecutors, and rushed through laws tightening government control over the judiciary and prosecution services.</p><p>He has repeatedly blamed the US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen – a former ally – for orchestrating what he says is a campaign aimed at toppling the government.</p><p>Erogan has held emergency meetings with the head of the Turkish secret intelligence agency, Hakan Fidan, since the recordings emerged, Turkish media has reported. The prime minister's office has issued a statement threatening legal action against anyone who circulated them.</p><p>The main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) has demanded that Erdogan resign. Speaking at a party meeting on Tuesday, the CHP leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said there was little doubt about the authenticity of the recordings and that the government had lost its legitimacy.</p><p>\"Take your helicopter and flee, go abroad, or resign from the prime ministry. Someone who robs the country cannot sit in the seat of a prime minister,\" he said.</p><p>Devlet Bahceli, head of the right-wing National Movement party (MHP), used equally damning words in local election rally speech on Tuesday: \"This is a very critical moment for Turkey. Hunger, injustice, immorality, corruption and bribery are amongst Turkey's main problems. This is the image we have of eleven years of [the AKP's rule].</p><p>said: \"There are signs that the prime minister is at the head of corruption in Turkey. The prime minister speaks of a plot. If it really is a lie and a plot, it should be proven to the people. But if any of this is true, he cannot remain prime minister for even one second longer. The prosecution has to act.\"</p><p>Others in the opposition, however, cautioned against action that would plunge Turkey further into chaos. The co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party, Selahattin Demirtas, said that all responsible parties should be brought to justice.</p><p>\"The only things the prime minister should do is to let justice take its course. You might not save yourself, but you might save this country, with more transparency and more democracy.\"</p>","headline":"Leaked tapes prompt calls for Turkish PM to resign","trailText":"Recordings appear to capture Recep Tayyip Erdogan instructing son to dispose of hidden funds amid corruption investigation","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393356871405/Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-006.jpg","wordcount":"778","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-28T19:35:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/leaked-tapes-calls-erdogan-resign-turkish-pm","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/25/leaked-tapes-calls-erdogan-resign-turkish-pm","tags":[{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-430737178","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393356863938/Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Burhan Ozbilici","altText":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","height":"54","credit":"Burhan Ozbilici/AP","caption":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses MPs in Ankara.

The good jobs, the better pay, the promotion prospects all depended on your dedication to a shadowy Islamic network with its headquarters based in Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"They kept tabs on every recruit, had a grading system from zero to five – five being the ones who prayed, fasted, never drank alcohol,\" the policeman said, referring to the movement founded by the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, who lives in exile in the US.</p><p>\"Everything starts in the police schools,\" said Yilmaz. \"They came to me once, I said no. But it's very subtle. One day a friend will ask you to go to breakfast at a certain friend's house, to read a certain book, go for dinner. These appointments become more and more regular. When you're in school, you have very little money. They organise a few things to make it easier. Free meals, for example, free accommodation. Once you're inside, they organise your life; you just get sucked in. And once you graduate, you can start working in whichever unit you like.\"</p><p>The power and the influence of the elderly cleric is the defining issue of Turkish politics. Recep Tayyıp Erdoğan, the prime minister, has declared war on Gülen – previously a key ally of his conservative, Islamic ruling party – following the eruption of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/turkish-ministers-sons-arrested-corruption-investigation\" title=\"\">corruption scandal in December</a> that implicates the government, the prime minister's closest associates and his family.</p><p>Erdoğan responded ferociously, purging the police of thousands of officers, transferring prosecutors linked to the investigation and tightening control over the judiciary. A fortnight ago, according to senior officials in Brussels, he told EU leaders that his fight with Gülen was a matter of political survival. \"He was gripped with this obsession of killing the parallel state, as he called it,\" said a well-placed EU official.</p><p>In Turkey it has long been assumed that Gülen's network exercised unaccountable influence inside the judicial and security apparatus. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jan/09/press-freedom-turkey\" title=\"\">investigative journalist Ahmet Şık</a> was jailed for writing a book about it, as was Hanefi Avcı, a former police chief. But that was when Erdoğan and Gülen were allies.</p><h2><strong>Assertion</strong></h2><p>In 2009 the then US ambassador in Ankara, James Jeffrey, wrote in a cable to the state department: \"The assertion that the Turkish national police is controlled by Gülenists is impossible to confirm but we have found no one who disputes it.\"</p><p>Yilmaz and other police officers who spoke up confirmed the scale and degree of penetration by adherents of a movement that is religious, cultural and educational as well as political.</p><p>Oğuz Gün* has been working in the Istanbul police force for more than seven years. \"Such opaque groups are very dangerous. And [Gülen's] is a group that discriminates against those who don't share the same values and the same lifestyle. I have seen how they started to mistake sins for crimes, both inside and outside the force,\" he said.</p><p>He sought transfers to other units: secret intelligence, anti-terror, organised crime. To no avail. Gün was never affiliated with the Gülenist movement. \"Sometimes they openly asked for a reference. Without it, I didn't stand a chance.\"</p><p>Yilmaz said: \"If you asked someone how did you manage to get into the secret intelligence unit, they would answer: I prayed and got in. We had friends who spoke six languages, were top of their class, and were standing guard outside police stations. And others who were a lot less qualified got the top jobs only because they were connected with the Gülenists.\"</p><p>The assumption in Turkey and abroad is that the corruption allegations against the Erdoğan administration originate with Gülen, and that they are likely to be well-founded because of the quality of the intelligence the movement commands. Erdoğan is seen to be trying not only to destroy the cleric but also to bury the corruption allegations.</p><p>Şık, the journalist jailed in 2011 for writing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/turkey-censorship-ahmet-sik-perrier\" title=\"\">book on Gülen's penetration of the police</a>, highlighted what many see as the problem. \"The attempt to purge Gülenists doesn't mean that [Erdoğan] is right. There is also a real witchhunt going on. We have massive corruption on the one hand, but the investigation against it also violates democratic and judicial principles. It's a choice between a rock and a hard place, pest and cholera. One is not better, or cleaner, than the other.\"</p><p>The officers welcomed the backlash against the network inside the police but stressed that it should not serve to legitimise corruption. \"Of course I want those who are corrupt to be punished. I am not defending corruption at all. But these purges were long overdue,\" said Yilmaz. \"The government knew about this. It was the government in the first place who enabled them, who helped them, they came to power together. Helping them was the government's biggest mistake.\"</p><p>Gün spoke of a huge sense of relief among his colleagues that the police were being cleared of the network. \"It really was an atmosphere of deep paranoia. Even if it seemed technically impossible for every single officer's phone to be tapped, we were all afraid of being spied on all the time.\"</p><p>The pressure was subtle, but constant: \"Nobody would force you to pray, or fast during Ramadan. But they kept tabs on all of that, on everyone. Nobody talked about it. Everybody knew, but nobody dared to discuss the issue. This has started to change.\"</p><p>Erdoğan's offensive represents a sea change. The domination of his Justice and Development party (AKP) for more than a decade was aided by his alliance with Gülen, the cleric's formidable organisation, money and influence.</p><p>Those who dared to criticise the Gülen movement before were swiftly punished. Şık was accused of being a member of a nationalist network, although he and his colleagues had previously disclosed plans by the same network to stage a military coup against the AKP government. He was released from jail in 2012, but his trial is ongoing.</p><h2><strong>Phone-tapping</strong></h2><p>In 2010 Hanefi Avcı, a former police chief and former Gülen supporter, was arrested on charges of being a member of a terrorist organisation after publishing a book in which he described the infiltration of the Turkish police force by the Gülenists and accused them of illegally tapping phones and falsifying evidence. Last year the self-described rightwing sympathiser was sentenced to more than 15 years in jail for membership of the armed leftwing group Revolutionary Headquarters.</p><p>Erdoğan's current purges are dramatic and far-reaching. But the officers say such purges have been taking place more quietly for years. According to both Yilmaz and Gün, internal investigations have been conducted against tens of thousands of police officers over the past four years alone. \"If someone was suspected of going against [Gülen] they were often hit with made-up disciplinary charges, transferred to bad posts, or even suspended,\" Gün said. \"The removals we see today are not new. They just hit the other camp.\"</p><p>Not all police officers, however, are as happy with the current purges. The Police Reform Group, an organisation campaigning for police rights, tweeted: \"How do you know that the officers who were transferred are Gülenists and members of an organisation? Do you have a detector? Where is justice?\"</p><p>EU officials monitoring the drama say Erdoğan is deploying an indiscriminate dragnet in the belief that it will catch all the Gülen appointments. Yilmaz agrees. \"I am guessing that not all of these guys were Gülenists. And not all sympathisers were bad, either. And no police officer should ever be punished just for doing a good job.\"</p><p>Faruk Sezer, a founding member of the unofficial police union Emniyet-Sen, argued that a transparent inquiry into the alleged shadow organisation was indispensable. \"If an officer committed a crime, it needs to be brought to light and that person needs to be suspended and punished. But those who were transferred without reason and proof should of course be reinstated.\"</p><p>Last month Istanbul prosecutors started an investigation into officers who took part in anti-corruption raids in December. Do police officers fear doing their job in such a loaded atmosphere? Yilmaz shrugged: \"We have started to tell jokes among ourselves like: oh dear, you caught a shoplifter, you'd better start packing your bags, you'll get transferred for that.\"</p><p>\"The war between Gülen and the government will not end any time soon,\" said Şık. \"Turkish people caught in the middle will suffer. We already live in a very oppressive period, and I am afraid that this might get much worse.\"</p><p><em>* Names have been changed.</em></p>","headline":"Turkish police caught in middle of war between Erdoğan and former ally Gülen","trailText":"Some officers welcome crackdown on shadowy network around exiled cleric but stress it should not serve to legitimise corruption","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391954231418/Turkish-riot-police-006.jpg","wordcount":"1400","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-12T14:04:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-fethullah-gulen-network","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-fethullah-gulen-network","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/constanze-letsch","webTitle":"Constanze Letsch","r2ContributorId":"46835","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/constanze-letsch","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/constanze-letsch","references":[]},{"id":"world/islam","webTitle":"Islam","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/islam","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429289437","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391954222472/Turkish-riot-police-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Jivan Guner","altText":"Turkish riot police","height":"54","credit":"Jivan Guner/EPA","caption":"Turkish riot police take cover during clashes with anti-government protesters in Istanbul.

It’s repression. But the young will not be repressed. We won’t take it lying down.” </p><p>Protesters threw stones at police, smashed windows — including at a US fast-food outlet — and sprayed anarchy signs on banks. They were pursued by police down side streets off the central Istiklal boulevard. </p><p>Earlier in the day the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vehemently rejected criticism of the new curbs, passed on Wednesday by parliament, to a crowd of several thousand supporters in Istanbul.</p><p>“These regulations do not impose any censorship at all on the internet ... On the contrary they make it safer and freer.” </p><p>He denied that authorities would have access to internet users’ personal information: “Never. It is out of the question that people’s private data will be recorded.” </p><p>Critics have said the new curbs are an attempt by Erdogan to stifle dissent and stop evidence being seen online of high-level corruption. </p><p>They give the telecoms authority the power to order a webpage blocked without a court order if the content is deemed to infringe privacy or is offensive. </p><p>The timing has raised eyebrows because it comes as Erdogan deals with a graft scandal that erupted in December and implicates his inner circle. Erdogan has portrayed the investigation as a plot against him by people within the Turkish police and judiciary loyal to Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher living in the United States. </p><p>Human Rights Watch said the restrictions raised concerns that a “defensive government is seeking to increase its power to silence critics and to arbitrarily limit politically damaging material online”. </p><p>The European parliament’s president, Martin Schulz, has called the laws a “step back in an already suffocating environment for media freedom”. Washington has also expressed misgivings. </p><p>Erdogan’s government has sacked or moved to different jobs thousands of police and prosecutors ahead of important local elections on 30 March that could determine whether he runs for president in August. </p><p>Burak, a young demonstrator in Istanbul, said: “One of the few remaining liberties we have is the internet and being able to communicate. This is what they want to constrain … they are really scared of social networks and the internet.” </p><p>Erdogan, 59, who has been in power since 2003, is also seeking to push through legislation reforming the judiciary, which critics will say will increase government control. There also are worries for the freedom of the press. </p><p>On Friday an Azeri journalist and blogger was deported from Turkey because of tweets criticising the government, according to his newspaper, Zaman, which is close to Gulen. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said Mahir Zeynalov’s ejection “is a further setback for the dire state of media freedom in Turkey’’. </p><p>The US-based rights group Freedom House said that over the past year in Turkey “dozens of journalists have been fired because of government pressure, and government officials’ threats against journalists have become common”.</p>","headline":"Turkish police crack down on internet freedom protest","trailText":"Teargas and water cannon used as Erdogan government’s internet restrictions spark violent street scenes and global outcry<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391916866876/aee66d9d-7d1e-4afe-a31a-c99b6523cf38-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"573","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-12T15:00:15+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-crack-down-on-internet-freedom-protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/09/turkish-police-crack-down-on-internet-freedom-protest","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"world/censorship","webTitle":"Censorship","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/censorship","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-701c702b-cd71-43f9-9784-90d62805dece","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391916866421/aee66d9d-7d1e-4afe-a31a-c99b6523cf38-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391916866421/aee66d9d-7d1e-4afe-a31a-c99b6523cf38-220x132.jpeg","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"OZAN KOSE","altText":"Istanbul riot","height":"132","credit":"OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"A protester clashes with riot police during the protest on Saturday.

In London the FTSE 100 closed slightly lower at 6544 following a 28-point fall, while the dollar weakened against two traditional safe-haven currencies – the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.</p><p>The Russian rouble hit a record low on the foreign exchanges amid speculation that the slow-growing commodity-dependent economy was likely to be one of the next countries to feel the impact of the emerging market sell-off.</p><p>\"The fact that currencies have continued to weaken even in countries that have started to raise interest rates opens up a new, and potentially more worrying, phase of the recent turmoil in EM financial markets in which beleaguered policymakers find themselves unable to defend their currencies,\" said Capital Economics.</p><p>The London-based consultancy said, however, that not all emerging markets were likely to be caught up in the deepening crisis and expressed confidence that countries such as Mexico, Poland and the Philippines were likely to shrug off the effects of weakening currencies.</p><p>Turkey was again the centre of attention on Wednesday after Erdogan made it clear he vehemently opposed the decision to raise interest rates and that the central bank would be responsible for any damage caused to the economy.</p><p>The lira gained almost 4% after the central bank finally decided on Tuesday to ignore Erdogan's opposition and adopt a more aggressive policy stance, but the gains rapidly melted away as investors reacted with alarm to the political schism.</p><p>Michael Hewson of CMC said: \"The bumper rate hike by the central bank of Turkey had a shelf life of less than 18 hours after Turkish prime minister Erdogan criticised the decision by saying that he would blame central bank officials for any damage caused to the economy by a slowdown in growth. As a result. the lira reversed all of last night's gain, after last night's initial spike higher.</p><p>\"The South African rand has also weakened sharply despite a 0.5% rate hike by the South African Reserve Bank. The net effect was the equivalent of standing in front of a runaway truck as after a brief spike, the move lower continued apace.\"</p>","headline":"Emerging markets crisis sees rush for safe

He was told that his bill giving the executive authority over judges and prosecutors ran foul of European constitutional norms on the separation of powers.</p><p>The prime minister stood his ground, insisting that he was committed to the separation of powers . But he argued that judges were not acting independently in Turkey and that his bill would force them to do so.</p><p>\"The judiciary should not go beyond its defined mission and mandate,\" said Erdoğan. \"When one power starts interfering with another power, this country loses its quality of democracy.\"</p><p>The problem, he said, would be fixed \"legislatively\". His remedy includes putting the justice minister – a new appointment and close ally – in a position to discipline and remove judges and prosecutors.</p><p>Erdoğan's robust defence of his controversial policies follows the allegations of corruption on a huge scale at the heart of his government, also implicating the prime minister's family.</p><p>Dismissing the investigation into the sleaze allegations as a foreign plot to topple his government, he has moved to purge senior police ranks and exert greater control over the judiciary. According to the European commission (EC), some 2,000 senior police officers, including most of those in key intelligence and investigative roles, have been fired or re-assigned in the past month.</p><p>José Manuel Barroso, EC president, said after talks with Erdoğan: \"Whatever the problems are, the solutions should respect the principles of the rule of law and the separation of powers.\"</p><p>Erdoğan's war with Turkey's judges and police is ascribed to a bitter power struggle with his erstwhile ally, the US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen, who runs networks of religious schools and cultural bodies in Turkey and who is said to have high-powered followers within the state's security and judicial structures.</p><p>\"That's the core of the problem,\" said a senior EU official dealing with Turkey. \"It's a big setback. There has been damage done to the rule of law in Turkey. We made our concerns very clear.\"</p><p>Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's foreign minister, warned on Monday that EU membership talks with Turkey might need to be frozen because of Erdoğan's conduct. The negotiations only resumed in November after being suspended for 40 months because of various other disputes.</p><p>Erdoğan, who dominates Turkish politics after 11 years in office, has turned increasingly authoritarian since last May, when his power was challenged as never before by a wave of national street protest that was crushed by excessive police violence.</p><p>The contested judiciary bill is currently being pushed through parliament in Ankara. The main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement party (MHP), which both oppose the changes proposed  by the Erdoğan government, called for the bill to be put to the parliamentary constitutional commission. According to Turkish media reports, this met on Monday, with the justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ present, but failed to reach agreement.</p><p>The former culture minister, Ertugrul Günay, who resigned from Erdoğan's Justice and Development (AK) party over the government's handling of the corruption scandal, harshly criticised the government's proposed changes to the judiciary law as \"unconstitutional\".</p><p>He said: \"I am sad to see what politics has come to. Important judicial changes are being made. We are trying to change a law that underwent reforms three years ago. Many believe this law is unconstitutional ... You might need the law one day. Let's not change the laws according to what might suit you and what might suit me.\"</p><p>President Abdullah Gül, who must sign the bill into law, has also voiced reservations about the proposed measures.</p><p>If Erdoğan pushes the bill through, there is likely to be an appeal to the constitutional or supreme court. But the law would be in force pending the appeal, enabling the government, critics say, to make the personnel changes it wants.</p>","headline":"Brussels urges Turkish PM Erdoğan to redraft law purging police and judiciary","trailText":"<p>EU says Turkish prime minister's bill extending control over police, judges and prosecutors flouts separation of powers</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/21/1390331771894/Turkish-PM-Recep-Tayyip-E-006.jpg","wordcount":"685","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-24T19:19:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/21/brussels-turkey-prime-minister-erdogan-rewrite-law-judiciary-police","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/21/brussels-turkey-prime-minister-erdogan-rewrite-law-judiciary-police","tags":[{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan","references":[]},{"id":"world/european-commission","webTitle":"European commission","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/european-commission","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/protest","references":[]},{"id":"world/germany","webTitle":"Germany","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/germany","references":[]},{"id":"profile/iantraynor","webTitle":"Ian Traynor","rcsId":"GNL017450","r2ContributorId":"15752","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/ian_traynor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ian Traynor is the Guardian's European editor.

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), described the ever-deteriorating situation in Syria as \"the defining humanitarian crisis of our time\".</p><p>The UNHCR, European commission and British Refugee Council have urged EU leaders to acknowledge the exceptional crisis posed by the Syrian civil war and accept the temporary settlement of Syrian refugees inside their borders – relaxing \"fortress\" policies designed to keep migrants out of Europe.</p><p>The UN has issued an urgent call to resettle 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrians worldwide – a call that remains unmet as the exodus from Syria into Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq fast outpaces the capacity to provide for them. The UK government has refused to take part in the resettlement scheme, calling the idea tokenistic and stressing the importance of the £500m of aid it has sent to the region.</p><p>António Guterres, UN commissioner for refugees, told the Guardian: \"While countries neighbouring the conflict are being asked to keep their borders open, I find it disconcerting how many Syrians struggle to find protection in Europe, with reports of people being pushed back from a number of borders. And all this is happening although the overall numbers are small in comparison – Turkey alone has received 10 times the number of Syrian refugees as all EU member states together.</p><p>\"I have been repeatedly calling on all countries, particularly in Europe and the extended Middle East, to allow Syrians to access asylum and enjoy quality protection.\"</p><p>Michele Cercone, spokesperson for the European commissioner for home affairs, said member states could not be coerced to accept the resettlement programme, but the commission had offered €6,000 (£5,000) towards every refugee a country accepted. \"If all member states would get involved into an EU resettlement exercise and make available a proportionate number of places, we would be able to resettle thousands people more from refugee camps.\"</p><p>The EU has stressed the importance of aid but has resisted sharing the vast burden of refugees. While it has applied enormous pressure on Turkey to keep its borders open – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/syrian-refugee-crisis-tensions-turkey\" title=\"\">Turkey</a> has so far accepted about 600,000 people – it is working as quickly as possible to create a network of fences, patrols and policies to keep them from entering Europe. The EU has spent millions on border controls between Turkey and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/07/syrian-refugees-turned-back-greek\" title=\"\">Greece</a>.</p><p>About 64,000 Syrians – 2.4% of the total number who have fled – have sought asylum in Europe, with 60% of those applications made in Sweden and Germany.</p><p>The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, revealed last week that the UK had taken in 1,500 displaced Syrians through regular asylum routes, but that number falls far short of demands of the UN.</p><p>\"The neighbouring countries are beyond what in the west would be considered the breaking point,\" Miliband said. \"The refugee influx into Lebanon – more than 800,000 out of a population of 4.5 &nbsp;million – is the equivalent of 60 million people coming to the US. The cost of the crisis to the Lebanese economy alone is estimated by the World Bank at $7.5bn (£4.5bn). It is time for the rest of the world to step up and for the US to lead by example.\"</p><p>Frustrated by the government's position, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/13/uk-find-room-syrian-refugees\" title=\"\">the Refugee Council has published a strongly worded letter</a> in the Guardian addressed to David Cameron, stating \"aid is not enough\". The letter – signed by Colin and Livia Firth, Emma Thompson, Michael Palin, Dame Vivienne Westwood, Grayson Perry and Juliet Stevenson – says: \"So far, 18 countries have responded by pledging resettlement places for Syrian refugees. We're ashamed Britain isn't one of them.\"</p><p>Vincent Cochetel, the director of UNHCR for Europe, described the UK's response as \"timid\" and \"not good enough\". Refugees - Afghanis and Somalis as well as Syrians - fleeing some of the most violent conflicts of our aged are simply being pushed into dangerous, illegal journeys to find safety.</p><p>As the inevitable exodus into Jordan, Turkey and the Kurdish north of Iraq continues, so enormous humanitarian demands grow.</p><p>The unresolved refugee crisis has been particularly destablising in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/nov/01/syria-lebanon-iran-hezbollah-israel\" title=\"\">Lebanon</a>, whose fragile sectarian mix is being increasingly unsettled by the influx of primarily Sunni Muslim refugees. The Lebanese government has refused to allow refugee camps or anything resembling a permanent shelter to be constructed on its territory, fearing deeply ingrained <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/02/beirut-car-bomb-blast-hezbollah-stronghold\" title=\"\">sectarian</a> tensions will be inflamed.</p><p>As the war has intensified, regional backers have increasingly shored up support for their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/15/saudia-arabia-iran-proxy-war-syria\" title=\"\">proxies</a>. The Alawite-led regime of Bashar al-Assad is resolutely backed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/28/syria-army-iran-forces\" title=\"\">Iran</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/02/russia-syria-civil-war-dagestan\" title=\"\">Russia</a>, while the predominantly Sunni opposition is supported equally strongly by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/05/gulf-states-warning-arming-syria\" title=\"\">Gulf states</a>.</p><p>Syria has become an unflinching contest for regional supremacy, anchored largely by the ancient regional power struggle between Tehran and Riyadh, but fuelled by more contemporary grievances.</p><p>The volatile sectarian power tussle leaves little concern for the health and safety of millions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2013/jul/25/syria-refugee-crisis-a-day-in-the-life\" title=\"\">refugees</a>, the majority of whom are women and children.</p><p>\"We are talking about people that are in dire need,\" Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said, arguing that the British government was being led too strongly by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/13/syrian-refugees-uk-pilloried-amnesty-closing-borders\" title=\"\">domestic pressures</a> on migration. \"[What] we are seeing from the camps is eye-wateringly scary. It is just not a sustainable environment for people who cannot look out for themselves.\"</p><p>In a cafe in Istanbul, the Guardian found Syrian refugees discussing the response of Europe to the crisis, and the options available to them as a result. Because Turkey offers sanctuary but no permanent residency, refugees cannot work legally. Men in the cafe talk about travelling illegally to countries such as  Germany or Sweden, which have very generous policies towards Syrians who make it to their borders. But there are almost no legal routes to either country from Syria or Turkey. At least Britain's position is honest, says one man: \"They don't want any Syrians.\"</p><p>One man, Tarek, describes how he has tried and failed three times to cross into Europe through Bulgaria, each time being caught by Bulgarian border guards and \"pushed back\" into Turkey. If this was on Bulgarian territory, it was a breach of international refugee law. Illegal push backs from Greece and Italy have been widely reported by human rights groups.</p><p>This journey has separated Tarek from his wife, Yasmin, who is nine months' pregnant and their four-year-old son.</p><p>The Guardian found Yasmin in Harmanli detention camp in Bulgaria where she and her son are living in a portable building with three other families, surviving on one meal a day.</p><p>Back in Istanbul, Tarek says he will keep trying to get into Bulgaria to find his wife: \"We suffer twice, first in Syria and now as refugees. I feel like I'm fighting the world to be with my family.\"</p><p>Syrians are not alone in their perceptions of the European asylum system as a giant trap. For refugees from across Asia and North Africa, including Afghans, Somalis and Eritreans, it is now almost impossible to appeal for asylum in Europe without travelling illegally along dangerous routes.</p><p>Those who do reach Europe are further confined by the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33153_en.htm\" title=\"\">Dublin</a> agreement, which stipulates that asylum seekers must remain in their first country of entry, despite the differing conditions that refugees face across the EU. Italy, Greece and Bulgaria have all been widely criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers, but they say their geographical position means they are bearing an unfair share of responsibility for coping with refugee flows.</p><p>Cochetel said traumatised refugees were being put at risk by European policy. He argues that there must be wider reform of asylum policy in Europe, as Syria's neighbours cannot be expected to bear the full humanitarian weight of a conflict that offers little hope resolution.</p><p>\"It's not good enough; its timid,\" Chochetel said: \"Five hundred in France, 10 in Hungary, 90 in Ireland, none in the UK. We need to wake up to the situation. Everybody was hoping for a quick fix, but the reality of the conflict is that we know many people will never go home, not just because their house is gone but because the infrastructure is gone.\"</p>","headline":"EU must open doors to avoid Syrian refugee catastrophe, says UN","trailText":"Colin Firth, Michael Palin and Grayson Perry condemn lack of British action over what David Milliband calls 'the defining humanitarian crisis of our time'","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/13/1389635225658/Syrian-refugee-children-001.jpg","wordcount":"1415","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-16T18:30:06Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/13/syrian-refugee-catastrophe-european-union-united-nations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/13/syrian-refugee-catastrophe-european-union-united-nations","tags":[{"id":"world/series/fortress-europe","webTitle":"Fortress Europe","type":"series","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/fortress-europe","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/series/fortress-europe","references":[]},{"id":"world/refugees","webTitle":"Refugees","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/refugees","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/unitednations","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/lebanon","webTitle":"Lebanon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/lebanon","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/turkey","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/foreignpolicy","webTitle":"Foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/foreignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/foreignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-chulov","webTitle":"Martin Chulov","r2ContributorId":"29038","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290791972910/martin-chulov.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Chulov covers the Middle East for the Guardian.
