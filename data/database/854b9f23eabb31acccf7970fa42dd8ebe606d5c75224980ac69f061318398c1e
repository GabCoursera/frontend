The first, overriding one, is the cruel insanity of the regime of interrogation that he suffered, a never-ending nightmare of sleep deprivation and beatings and solitary confinement, which he endured with defiance and stubborn courage. The second, which nags just slightly throughout, is Errachidi's account of the bizarre personal decisions that led him to being incarcerated in the first place ... You are left feeling that there is no such thing as an \"ordinary man\", as the book's subtitle wants to describe him; another is that his extraordinary story, with all its surreal and brutal twists, needed telling. <br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/08/general-guantanamo-ahmed-errachidi-review\">• Read the full review here</a>","width":"397"}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395939220302/The-General-by-Ahmed-Erra-003-thumb-1325.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","altText":"The Orwell Prize Longlist: The General by Ahmed Errachidi","height":"68","credit":"PR","caption":"The General by Ahmed Errachidi","width":"68"}}]},{"id":"gu-image-433154645","relation":"gallery","type":"image","galleryIndex":11,"assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395939240678/The-Tragedy-of-Liberation-011.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","altText":"The Orwell Prize Longlist: The Tragedy of Liberation by Frank Dikötter","height":"600","credit":"PR","caption":"<strong>The Tragedy of Liberation by Frank Dikötter</strong> <br/>\r\nFor many years, historians tended to argue that the first decade or so of [Mao's] rule was generally benevolent and productive, with the rot setting in during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

It was a world of slum landlords, gang warfare, race riots and, it must be said, a strong sense of community ... This is the biography of a politician like no other. From time to time one has to pinch oneself to recall that this is not an account of childhood in Victorian England but of life in the England of the 1950s and 60s, the era when many of us had never had it so good. Far from being a misery memoir, however, it is beautifully observed, humorous, moving, uplifting; told with a dry, self-deprecating wit and not a trace of self-pity. <br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/this-boy-alan-johnson-review\">• Read the full review here</a>","width":"389"}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395939238148/This-Boy-by-Alan-Johnson-010-thumb-66.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","altText":"The Orwell Prize Longlist: This Boy by Alan Johnson","height":"68","credit":"PR","caption":"This Boy by Alan Johnson","width":"68"}}]},{"id":"gu-image-433154738","relation":"gallery","type":"image","galleryIndex":14,"assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395939778246/The-XX-Factor-by-Alison-W-014.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","altText":"The Orwell Prize Longlist: The XX Factor by Alison Wolf","height":"600","credit":"PR","caption":"<strong>The XX Factor by Alison Wolf</strong> <br/>\r\nWolf has discovered, \"the labour markets of egalitarian welfare-state Scandinavia\" display yawning gaps between higher paid and lower paid women, not to mention \"the highest levels of gender segregation anywhere in the developed world\".
