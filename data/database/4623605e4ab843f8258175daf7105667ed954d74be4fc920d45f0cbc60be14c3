This matters","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The Sochi Winter Olympics were a success for Great Britain and once again women lead the way, winning three of their four medals. They had already won 24 of the 65 Team GB medals at London 2012 and exactly half of the 120 medals at the Paralympics. A significant part of that huge gold haul came from cycling. Women ruled supreme on the track and Lizzie Armistead's hard-fought silver on the road behind Marianne Vos was arguably one of the highlights of the Games, the women's race handily outstripping the moribund men's affair for sheer excitement and balls out racing.</p><p>So these are great days for women's sport, right? The Olympic legacy has been translated into higher all-round visibility for women's sport, greater participation, more sponsorship and increased coverage, hasn't it? In a word, no. Just two months after the Olympic flame was extinguished in 2012, the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/24/womens-sport-underfunded-ignored-charity-claims\">women's sport only received 5% of coverage and 0.5% of commercial sponsorship</a>. </p><p>Last year one of Britain's quality newspapers pledged to \"make sure our pages highlight the best of women's sport, as well as men's\", but a quick scan of their cycling coverage includes little more than articles on Victoria Pendleton's performances on Celebrity Bake Off and pictures of the multiple gold medallist in an evening dress. The cyclocross season and the achievements of Britain's Helen Wyman is not given an inch of space. The picture is no better elsewhere. Even dedicated cycling sites – the go-to places for credible, up-to-the-minute news – struggle to cover topics beyond elite male road racers.</p><p>Something highly significant has happened in the world of women's cyclocross. For the first time on European soil, a C1 cyclocross race will offer the same prize money for elite men and women. Just why this is such a big deal is particularly well explained in <a href=\"http://www.podiumcafe.com/2014/2/21/5433184/helen-wyman-equal-prize-money-koppenbergcross\">an interview cyclocross champion Helen Wyman gave Sarah Connolly at Podium Cafe</a>: parity not only rewards new young talent making participation worthwhile, but brings increased visibility, progression and growth to the sport. </p><p>\"In my eyes, this is a huge step,\" said Wyman. \"It is a very significant moment for women's cycling. This allows women to make one step up the ladder towards equality. I spend a lot of my free time trying to advance women's cyclocross and I hope this will lead to a chain reaction of races who do the same, as I know the support is there from sponsors, supporters and riders. To be a part of this development for the sport is fantastic for me. For the Koppenbergcross to be the first race in Europe to do this is very special. I love the Koppenbergcross, to me it is the biggest race outside of the World Championships. It is legendary. To have an American sponsor back the race shows how significant it is around the world. I can't thank Twenty20 Cycling enough on behalf of all of the racers that take part next season. I'm certainly already looking forward to the GP Twenty20 Cycling and hope to collect another cobble stone in 2014.\"</p><p>There's been something of a quiet revolution in cyclocross. Not only was it the first sport to offer equal prize money to its world champions, but its popularity is swiftly growing beyond six million fanatical Belgians thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mza9fQb9lqw\">UCI YouTube coverage of women's World Cup races</a>.</p><p>This has been a grass-roots movement. As Wyman says: \"The people who are racing, who are organising, who are proactive in making it happen are a small community, and we need to work together to make things happen. This is one step showing how we can work together\", a way of showing the UCI Cyclocross commission what can be achieved when the will and the vision are there. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.helenwyman.com/2014/02/what-gp-twenty20-cycling-means-to-me/\">On her blog, Wyman speaks about the two ladders to progress</a> – the political work of the commission and the grass-roots work of \"people getting stuck in: riders, organisers, the media and fans doing all they can to help the sport\". It may be a small community, but it has forced a change that has huge implications for the wider women's sport.</p><p>Wyman is that rare beast – a top-flight British woman cyclist, multiple national and European champion, conqueror of Marianne Vos and World Champion medallist – who is almost unknown to the public, perhaps because her chosen discipline, cyclocross, doesn't appear in the Olympics (though there are noises about its possible inclusion in the Winter Games). </p><p>A lifelong cyclist who began racing aged 14, Wyman says she rides cross because \"playing in the mud and calling it a job is just the best feeling in the world\". The sport is supposed to have originated in France – and many of its skills, like portage (running while carrying the bike), were pioneered by road racers like Octave Lapize and Eugène Christophe – it found its spiritual home in the flatlands of Flanders. </p><p>The terrain suits the mud and madness of cyclocross, the dirt and action a powerful antidote to the more sanitised world of road cycling. Cyclocross relies on sharp individual skills and crazy fans for whom it's more a religion than a sport. It's dirtier and earthier than road racing and challenges the idea that cycling equals the Tour de France. </p><p>The Koppenbergcross is one of the sport's iconic races – like Paris-Roubaix, the winner takes home a granite cobblestone for their pains – which makes the decision to offer equal prize money a real milestone. It says that cycling is so much more than three weeks in July. It puts an external, quantifiable value on women's sport that sends a direct message to sponsors. And it's a divine opportunity for women to ignore the diktat that all worthwhile female sporting endeavour must be glamorous and fragrant and to be rewarded for good honest muck and sweat.</p><p>So prize parity for women is a good and important thing, right? Some people don't see it that way. When the last bastion of tennis inequality, Wimbledon, fell in 2007, the committee were unanimous in their decision. John McEnroe said the change would be \"setting an example to the rest of society in general to have equal prize money\". </p><p>Yet this enlightened attitude – that equal work deserves equal pay, as enshrined in European law – was challenged by French tennis player Gilles Simon on the grounds that \"men's tennis is ahead of women's tennis\" and \"men spend twice as long on court as women do at Grand Slams\". Apart from good old-fashioned chauvinism, the argument comes down to an assumed inequality of effort and lack of market appeal.</p><p>The first argument asks the wrong question. There is no doubt that female athletes train and prepare with equal rigour to their male counterparts. They spend the same hours in the gym and out on the road, and are equally scrupulous in their diet and approach. The US Lawn Tennis Association imposed the three-set rule for women's tennis in 1902 – over strong objections – and despite the fact that concerns about women's robustness to play five-set matches have disappeared, the rule remains. </p><p>Similar Victorian concerns about the fragility of women to run long distances were only overturned in the 1970s, when women's distance running gained credibility, despite our physiology being well suited to the demands of running 10,000 metres and upwards. Women play the full 90 minutes of football and run marathons in times that would send those chauvinist Victorians to the fainting couch. But cycling remains mired in this \"delicate flower\" mentality, with women's races routinely a third shorter than men's (even though there's a strong case to be made for equalising the distances downwards rather than upwards).</p><p>So why shouldn't women race the same distances as men? As <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/discussing-addition-womens-course-tour-de-france-cyclist-author-kathryn-bertine-qa-1554273\">Kathryn Bertine, one of the movers behind the petition for a women's Tour de France</a>, says: \"I and every female pro cyclist is asked at least once in their career, 'Do you race the Tour de France?' They simply assume there's one for women. People were shocked that there is not a women's equivalent.\" </p><p><a href=\"http://www.bicycling.com/news/pro-cycling/women-petition-ride-tour-de-france\">Emma Pooley, the English professional cyclist and Olympic silver medallist</a>, adds: \"My real dream is to see us doing the same race on the same course. At the moment, it's perfectly possible next year to run a three-week race with the men with slightly shorter stages.\"</p><p>When Marie Marvingt applied to ride the 1908 Tour de France, she was refused on the grounds that it was a race for men only. \"Breakneck Marie\" went ahead and did it anyway, starting each stage 15 minutes after the men and finishing the 14-stage, 4,448 km race. Out of 110 riders who were on the start line in Paris, only 36 finished: 36 men and one woman. </p><p>There's nothing to suppose that the highly trained, professional riders of the modern era aren't more than capable of doing the same. When a female reader wrote to l'Auto in 1909 to suggest they create a women's Tour de France, the idea was dismissed because it would have meant \"razing the mountains of France\". That this same argument is still in use in 2014 is startling. </p><p>In 1912, the Union Velocipedique de France stopped sanctioning women's races. In 1926, Sportive wrote that \"sportswomen go on rides for fun; nobody can object to that, but that women speed like 'giants of the road', no, a hundred times no!\" Women's cycling is still recovering from these antediluvian attitudes.</p><p>Another well-worn argument is the perceived lack of depth in women's cycling – where 150 men lined up for the Olympic road race in 2012, there were only 66 women on the start line. But why should Marianne Vos, arguably the best cyclist on the planet and one of the greatest of all time, be penalised because of the size of the field?</p><p>When <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games\">the X Games</a> – the annual extreme sports event hosted by ESPN – committed to equal prize money, both standards and numbers of participants rocketed. As Jane English argues: \"if women do not attain roughly equal fame and fortune in sports, it leads both men and women to think of women as naturally inferior.\" As Thomas Paine realised: \"It is dearness that gives everything its value.\"</p><p>But with the UCI still refusing to commit to a minimum wage for women riders, many are caught in what the pressure group <a href=\"http://213.206.113.108/faq/\">Le Tour Entier</a> describe as a \"vicious cycle\" where \"most women cannot yet make a full-salary living from cycling, and hence have to work and cannot train full-time – there is also a high drop-out rate from the sport compared to men's cycling, because of these financial pressures and the overall shortage of women's teams\". </p><p>Then there's the perceived lack of market appeal. The market decides the level of reward, goes the old canard, because the men's sport is so much more exciting. Try telling that to the millions who watched Vos beat Armistead on the Strand in a race that was as thrilling as the men's race was disappointing. </p><p>As Emma Pooley says: \"I've heard a lot of people say that the best race they've ever seen was the women's race at the Olympics. A lot of our races are like that, but you don't get to see it.\" Yet the word from on high, from Pat McQuaid and now from Brian Cookson, that there can be no compulsion of sponsors to create women's teams or races, that the sport must first prove its worth to sponsors, remains. What better way, then, to make a bold statement of that worth by pulling in sponsors who are prepared to challenge the \"market must decide\" rhetoric by putting their money where their principles (and self-interest) are and offering equal prize money? When Wyman says this is \"huge\", she is absolutely right.</p><p>When Simon made his ill-judged comments about women's tennis being less interesting than men's, Maria Sharapova pithily remarked: \"There are a few more people that watch my matches than his.\" The argument that market forces should decide wages is another wrongheaded one. As <a href=\"http://feminspire.com/equal-pay-wimbledon-women/\">sportswriter Abbey Lewis points out</a>: \"By Simon's own argument, if he wins Wimbledon next year his prize money should be less than Roger Federer's was this year because he is less famous: a ridiculous situation.\" As a discredited Texan once said: \"The Tour is a bike race, not a popularity contest.\" </p><p>On the sporting level, Lewis argues that there is no business model but a simple moral equation of equal pay for equal work. Market forces only come into play when sports stars attain the fame and popularity of celebrities and start to net big sponsorship deals, although the women of British cycling, despite their high profiles, are never remunerated in the way their male counterparts have been. This argument works for many sports but for cycling the picture is a little more complicated. Sponsorship isn't just the cherry on the cake, it is the cake: it supports teams and pays rider's wages. In return it turns its riders into cycling billboards.</p><p>And here the cycle gets that little bit more vicious. Put simply, coverage leads to sponsorship, which leads to growth and then more coverage. Take away that exposure and sponsors drop out, the money dries up and coverage disappears. Repeat until your sport drops off the radar all together. </p><p>The situation isn't quite that parlous for women's cycling, but a lack of coverage for women's sports in general is cited as one of the biggest barriers to growth. In evidence to the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/130726-women-and-sport-tor/\">Culture, Media and Sport Committee's \"Women in Sport\" inquiry</a>, Barbara Slater, Director of Sport at the BBC, estimated that women's sport coverage had risen to 20% from the headline 5% figure given by the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF). But that includes Red Button coverage and major events like the Olympics. Of the 9,000 hours of sport broadcast yearly, as few as 320 may be women's sport. And the picture isn't significantly different over the other major sports broadcasters.</p><p>Now factor in that Slater is the exception not the rule as a woman at the highest decision making level and the historic disadvantage of women's sports worsens. There are around 700 members of the Sports Journalists Association – 10% of those are women and only 5% of those are sports journalists. </p><p>Research by the University of East Anglia showed that, only 1,780 (6.9%) of 25,717 photographs that appeared in weekend newspapers over a two-year-period were of women. Women's representation on sporting bodies still lags behind the 25% recommended by the WSFF. When the majority of decisions about women's sport and the coverage it receives are made by men, can that disadvantage ever be overcome?</p><p>No one is suggesting that only women can cover women's sport. It is attitudes that need to change, and profoundly. As Messner and Cooky point out in their academic work on gender in televised sports, while it is a fallacy to assume that women necessarily approach sports coverage any differently to men, \"there is some evidence that women sports reporters are less likely to cover women athletes in disrespectful ways, and more likely to advocate expanding the coverage of women's sports.\" </p><p>There needs to be a commitment to cover women's sports in ways that challenge the male hegemony that undervalues and sexualises competitive women. Thinking afresh about the demands of a diverse audience is a smart way to create a new demand. It's all the more interesting, then, that cyclocross is leading the European charge for equal prize money – this is a sport whose participants love playing in the mud and is arguably far closer to most women's lived experience of recreational cycling than the shiny high-tech glitter of the road and track.</p><p>It doesn't matter who watches women's sport. When the BBC televised the Women's Euro 2013 football championship, the audience split was 70% male and 30% female. To reverse the trend and create a virtuous cycle, Slater argues that \"working with the governing bodies and striking up a really good partnership is very important – you want the top-quality sport; you want full stadia; you want a fantastic atmosphere; you want a sense of occasion.\" </p><p>But beyond that, there needs to be a profound cultural change – as Wyman points out, the organising committee behind the Koppenbergcross decision are male, but \"they're a pretty young, progressive committee and see there is a proper opportunity to do something big for women's 'cross. They were the first race to listen to us, to see there was good publicity in it for them, and that it was the right thing to do.\"</p><p>Though Leslie Howe argues compellingly for the redefinition of some traditionally male sports through a female perspective as a way to challenge dominant stereotypes and encourage those sports to develop in new and unexpected ways, both men and women have always had an equal ability to transfer potential energy into kinetic and propel a bike along a stretch of tarmac. Not for nothing did the American protofeminist Susan B Anthony call the bicycle the \"freedom machine\": \"Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel… the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.\" </p><p>It's been a long, hard road but women's cycling might finally be about to offer its professionals the freedom to earn the same living from their sport that the men have long enjoyed.</p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://100tours100tales.wordpress.com/\">This article appeared first on 100 Tours 100 Tales</a><br />• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinagirl\">Follow Suze Clemitson on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Follow Guardian Sport on Facebook</a></strong></p>","headline":"The long, hard road to equal pay for women's cycling and sport as a whole","trailText":"<p><strong>100 Tour 100 Tales:</strong> The Koppenbergcross, a prestigious cyclo-cross race dominated by the UK's Helen Wyman in recent years, is to award equal prize money for women and men for the first time.

Head coach uncompromising in his criticism<br />• Men's endurance and sprint squads underperformed","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>After his team's poor showing at the track world championships in Cali, the British Cycling head coach Shane Sutton was uncompromising in his criticism of underperforming riders while diverting any blame from the Performance Director Dave Brailsford, who was not at the championships due to his commitments in his other role as head of Team Sky. But Brailsford's role has been highlighted by Chris Boardman, who said the team needed \"a full-time boss.\"</p><p>Sutton had set a benchmark of six medals for the championship, but the team fell one short in spite of sterling efforts from women such as double gold medallist Joanna Rowsell. Of most concern was the men - endurance and sprint - returning empty-handed from a track World's for the first time since Lottery funding began in 1998. This was a sudden drop from 2013, when Great Britain topped the medal table with nine medals, including five golds.</p><p>\"The buck stops with me and I'm big enough to take it,\" said Sutton, who had harsh words for the men's endurance team, who managed only eighth in qualifying in the team pursuit, a key benchmark for Great Britain and a discipline in which they had won a medal every year since 2000, apart from a fourth place in 2009. Coming as it did on day one, that result set the tone for a week in which only Ed Clancy's fifth place in the omnium - with three first places in the six counting events - offering any relief from the gloom.</p><p>\"They need to look at themselves,\" said Sutton, pointedly. \"They got it wrong. They went out for the festive season, came back and weren't where they should have been (performance-wise). I've got concerns with the current crop of riders we've got and it's only them that can change. We've just gone backwards and I think the accountability rests with the riders.\" It was a result that raised eyebrows, among onlookers such as Dan Hunt, the coach who guided Clancy, Steven Burke, Peter Kennaugh and Geraint Thomas to gold in London, who told the Guardian afterwards, \"What concerns me is the quality of the teams in front of them. Being beaten by Germany, Switzerland and Spain is worrying.\"</p><p>It had been suggested the younger riders in the endurance squad, 21-year-old Sam Harrison, and 20-year-olds Owain Doull and Jon Dibben could eventually rival double Olympic team pursuit gold winners Clancy and Thomas, but Sutton is not so sure. \"Ed's special. I don't think the other boys have got the talent if I was totally honest,\" Sutton added.</p><p>\"When you've got a man like [London gold medallist] Steven Burke not to make the squad, he needs to reflect on where's he going. This isn't just pointing the finger at the men's team pursuit. This is not me criticising my team. I'm here to support them. [But] it's the World Championships and they have come here to perform. If they leave one stone unturned they're going to get exposed.\"</p><p>Sutton added that he would like the four-time Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins and the London 2012 gold medallist Peter Kennaugh to state their intentions over returning to the track for Rio. \"I know Pete's appetite for the track is still very big,\" Sutton said. \"We would welcome him with open arms, and Bradley. If Brad's definitely going to ride the track I think if he was to say sooner rather than later that is definitely a goal then that might just be that little bit of upward pressure that the other guys need.\"</p><p>Brailsford had said that he would reassess his role with the squad as part of the review process after Cali and Boardman - part of the senior management team that guided the squad to seven gold medals in Beijing – said that Brailsford needed to choose between Sky and Great Britain. \"[the team] needs a boss,\" Boardman said. \"I believe Dave's making a decision on what he's going to do, but it needs a full-time boss. Dave would clearly be the best full-time boss, but if he's not going to do that, it might be better if somebody else comes in and takes the reins.</p><p>\"He's such a character, if he's still there it's difficult for people to go in and take command, but it needs somebody like him. Shane [Sutton, the head coach] is great, a good second in command, but perhaps not the person to be the big boss. The potential is all still there. It just might need somebody to pull it all together. They're just missing an edge. If you were concerned about anything, it's the fact they're finding it difficult to pinpoint and haven't seen it coming into the event.\"</p><p>Sutton was keen to defend his boss, with whom he has worked closely since the Athens Games. \"For people to start pointing the finger at Dave is unfounded. This guy's been the greatest leader in British sport history. His legacy will go on and on.\" Sutton was adamant both he and Brailsford have the enthusiasm and desire to revitalise the British track team. \"We love a battle. We've got a real scrap on here now. I don't want to go anywhere; I probably want it more than the riders. I want to stay here, I want to take them into Rio (in 2016) and into Tokyo (in 2020), if I've got the opportunity.\"</p>","headline":"Shane Sutton slates Team GB's poor performance at world championships","trailText":"<p>Shane Sutton, the British Cycling head coach, was uncompromising in his criticism of an underperforming Team GB at the world championships</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/3/1393863423833/Shane-Sutton-the-British--006.jpg","wordcount":"891","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-06T23:01:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/03/shane-sutton-team-gb-world-track-championships","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/03/shane-sutton-team-gb-world-track-championships","tags":[{"id":"sport/team-gb","webTitle":"Team GB","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-gb","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-gb","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/dave-brailsford","webTitle":"Dave Brailsford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/dave-brailsford","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/dave-brailsford","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431239581","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/3/1393863413073/Shane-Sutton-the-British--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Luke Webber/British Cycling","altText":"Shane Sutton, the British Cycling head coach, was crtitical of Team GB at the world championships","height":"54","credit":"Luke Webber/British Cycling/PA","caption":"Shane Sutton, the British Cycling head coach, was crtitical of Team GB's backward step at the world championships.

On the plus side, the women's endurance riders continue to perform – although Canada pushed the team pursuit quartet harder than ever –while the sprinters are clearly in the mix.</p><p></p><h2>GB's generation gap</h2><p></p><p>In hindsight, London looks like the beginning of a rebuilding process after the departure of the golden Beijing generation led by Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Bradley Wiggins. The process is proving more contorted than might have been expected. Some riders who might have figured in the men's endurance programme up to now have options on the road with Team Sky and other squads, while others such as Mark Cavendish and Wiggins are talking about returning for Rio. In Hoy, GB have lost a charismatic leader and powerhouse who is not easily replaced; Pendleton's successors, Jess Varnish and Becky James, are heading in the right direction, but are not yet the finished article.</p><p></p><h2>The rest of the world is progressing fast</h2><p></p><p>The worry for the British is that other nations are clearly on the move. The French and Germans finished joint top of the medal table, with François Pervis and Kristina Vogel the dominant performers – and these established nations look to be gaining more strength in depth, as do Australia – but there is clear progress being made in less obvious quarters: New Zealand continue to make strides, the Chinese women's sprinters are improving; Colombia have found new stars in Edwin Ávila, winner of the points race, and the keirin silver medallist, Fabián Puerta, and the Irish have potential in Ryan Mullen.</p><p></p><h2>The men's endurance squad needs an urgent rethink</h2><p></p><p>This was their worst world championships since the start of lottery funding, with the team beaten by Spain, Germany and Switzerland inter alia en route to eighth place in the team pursuit qualifying round, followed by low placings in the bunch races, with Ed Clancy's respectable display in the omnium the only consolation. If Ireland, without an indoor track or any serious funding, can turn out a decent bunch racer in Martyn Irvine and in Mullen a sparkling young pursuiter, the British need to take a long look at themselves and their collective approach. Are they racing enough? Is the throughput of riders from the academy as good as it was, and are the under-23s being pushed as hard as they were when its former head Rod Ellingworth produced such talents as Cavendish and Clancy?</p><p></p><h2>Dave Brailsford needs to clarify his role</h2><p></p><p>Brailsford, the man at the head of the programme – although he has delegated the day to day running of it to Shane Sutton – has been publicly stating that he needs to clarify his role, and that he feels overstretched by his joint commitments to Team Sky and GB. That cannot fail to have an impact all the way down the chain of command and right through to the riders, who are entitled to wonder what is going on at the top. It's clear that Brailsford has to decide what he is going to do – but it is not that simple. The problem he has now is that if he reduces his role at GB, it looks as if he is walking away just as the ship is hitting choppy waters.</p><p></p><h2>The UCI needs to get behind this sport</h2><p></p><p>The racing from Colombia was vibrant, most notably Ávila's victory in the points race, but track cycling is struggling at international level where it is being inadequately marketed. This season the UCI struggled to put on three rounds of the World Cup, with two going to Mexico, one in a velodrome criticised as substandard. France and Germany are producing a wealth of top riders, particularly sprinters, but it is years since either of these major nations hosted a World Cup or world championships.

London's Olympic Velodrome will host the 2016 event.</p><p>It is understood a return to Melbourne, the world championships hosts in 2012, is possible, depending on whether the state of Victoria offers its financial support, and Aguascalientes in Mexico is another potential host. Its velodrome, which is at altitude, hosted last December's Track World Cup meeting at which a host of world records were smashed.</p><p>\"We have a number of proposals now on the table and we'll be making a decision very shortly,\" Cookson said. \"It's not ideal, but it's a real-world problem. The real-world problem was that there weren't any bidders coming forward.</p><p>\"The ones that were interested originally had withdrawn, so we are now proactively looking and talking to people and I'm optimistic that we'll get a solution in time so everyone will be able to book their flights.\"</p><p>The concern is not about the world championships themselves, but the lead-up to them, as the World Cup series carries qualification points for the event and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Riders must also qualify for World Cups through lower-profile meets throughout the summer.</p><p>Meetings in the next two months will determine the full calendar but federations have expressed a desire for the 2014-15 season schedule to be known in full by May at the latest.</p><p>Cookson hopes to ensure the uncertainty does not happen again. \"We are going to look at the process by which we have been inviting tenders and bids for world cups and world championships, particularly on the track, where we seem to have had a problem of getting sufficient people interested,\" he added. \"That's clearly something we've got to address. The track commission and myself and the senior staff at the UCI are going to be reviewing that and trying to make some changes.\"</p><p>The Track World Championships, which concluded in Cali, Colombia, on Sunday, were a resounding success. The Velodromo Alcides Nieto Patino has a roof suspended over the track but no walls – meaning the elements have an impact – and there were concerns last Monday, when wind blew rain water on to the track.</p><p>Cookson is determined it remains a truly global event. \"There's a clue in the name – it's a world championships, so there's got to be an opportunity of travelling from place to place,\" he said. \"It can't always be in the easiest places in Europe.</p><p>\"What we've got to make sure is when it does travel around the world, it's in venues that are suitable, facilities are accessible and all the rest of it. I'm determined that that's what we'll do in the future.\"</p>","headline":"2015 Cycling World Championships venue to be named soon, says UCI","trailText":"The venue for the 2015 Track Cycling World Championships will be named soon, the UCI president Brian Cookson has said","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/3/1393844176411/brian-cookson-006.jpg","wordcount":"471","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-06T11:01:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/03/world-track-cycling-championships-venue-2015-uci","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/03/world-track-cycling-championships-venue-2015-uci","tags":[{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431157750","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/3/1393844186706/brian-cookson-011.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Christopher Thomond","photographer":"Christopher Thomond","altText":"brian cookson","height":"276","credit":"Christopher Thomond/Christopher Thomond","caption":"Brian Cookson of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) says their are several proposals 'on the table'.

For the richest and most ambitious programme in world cycling, backed to the tune of £4m, that is bound to prompt questions given the lack of progress in the past 12 months.</p><p>Britain's women won two medals on the final day, with Laura Trott taking a second successive omnium silver and Becky James bronze in the keirin – leading the GB head coach, Shane Sutton, tovoice his hopes that the performances will act as an inspiration to their male counterparts.</p><p>The events in Cali mark a complete reversal of the situation between the Sydney and Athens Olympics, in the period before the emergence of Victoria Pendleton when the women's side of the squad was relatively weak – taking not a single world championship medal between 2001 and 2004 – while the men were consistent medallists as stars such as Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins earned their spurs.</p><p>Jason Kenny, the double Olympic champion in London in 2012 and a gold and silver medallist in Beijing, ended his world championship campaign without a medal for the first time since he made his debut at this level in 2008, but with three fifth places in the keirin, the title he won 12 months ago in Minsk, the match sprint – where he won the minor final on Saturday evening – and the team sprint, where he, Philip Hindes and Kian Emadi repeated their placing of last year.</p><p>\"It's fractions,\" Kenny said. \"Unfortunately we're at the wrong end of those fractions. We want to be fractions in front instead of fractions behind. The three fifth [places] tend to speak for themselves. I feel a little bit behind the top runners.\" The problem is that those fractions matter immensely in sprint qualifying, where the evidence suggests that the rest of the world has moved forward since the last Olympic cycling while the Britons have not progressed in comparison.</p><p>As he has done in the past, Kenny started off on the wrong foot by qualifying well down the order, 14th out of 24, guaranteeing that he would meet one of the fastest men later in the tournament; he eventually went out to the most rapid qualifier, François Pervis of France. This was actually a worse qualifying performance than he managed in 2013 in Minsk, when he ran in seventh but again went out in the quarter-finals.</p><p>The other senior member of the British squad, the endurance specialist Ed Clancy, was asked if he had an explanation for the poor form shown by Great Britain's men, and replied. \"No, in a word. This whole track campaign hasn't been a bad one. We've had some great results, great performances, just not this week. Truth be told, this whole week's been a bit of a nightmare. Team pursuit, it started off there.\" The British quartet's eighth place in the event, which probably means most to them, set the tone for the week.</p><p>On Saturday night Clancy finished fifth in the omnium, the event in which he took bronze in London, but his showing in the flying lap, the scratch and kilometre, all of which he won, should have given him the foundation for a medal at least. The points and elimination races are old achilles heels which he has countered in the past with a strong ride in the pursuit; in Cali his pursuit form deserted him. \"With the form I had, fifth is the best I could've hoped for. [The] points and scratch and elimination race weren't that bad. The pursuit I was going nowhere. Back to the drawing board and we'll try to sort it out next year.\"</p><p>The British women, on the other hand,  can move forwards with some confidence. James was unable to retain her title in the keirin but secured bronze after fighting her way back in through the repechage, having been relegated following victory in her first heat for leaving the sprinters' lane. She was well beaten in a final won by Germany's Kristina Vogel, with Australia's Anna Meares second. \"I'm really happy,\" said James. \"It's always disappointing not to win but Kristina Vogel has been flying all season. She deserved it.</p><p>\"I was going out to win it. I should have tried to beat her to the jump but she went over on Anna and Anna had a nice little slipstream while I was just hanging on the outside.</p><p>\"I really enjoyed it. It's a nice way to finish.\"</p><p>Trott was second to Sarah Hammer having faced an uphill task to get past the American from her overnight second place, but could at least point to a stronger than usual showing in the discipline that has lost her ground in the past, the points race, where she ran in fourth.</p><p>There was evidence, too, of the continuing progress of Scotland's Katie Archibald, who was in the hunt in the points race before finishing fourth. She may have been out of the medals but this was only the fourth time she had ridden a points race at international level, and her  improvement could make her one of the stars this summer when the Commonwealth Games take place on her home  ground in Glasgow.</p><p>\"We should rejoice in the fact that our women have done so well here,\" Sutton said. \"It's a credit to them and, being hunted like they're hunted, at every major championships, at every competition, is far tougher than you hunting someone.</p><p>\"They stand up and they're counted every time. I can only admire that and I know that will carry them through in good stead to Rio.</p><p>\"I'm not going to compare one against the other. I'd just like to think the boys will take inspiration from what the girls have done off the back of winning the Olympics and then going on to win another couple of world titles. \"</p>","headline":"Great Britain men leave Cycling World Championships empty-handed","trailText":"The British men left Colombia without a medal but Becky James took bronze in the keirin and Laura Trott scooped a second successive world omnium silver","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393762238183/Jason-Kenny-003.jpg","wordcount":"992","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-05T12:25:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/02/jason-kenny-british-cyclists-cycling-world-championships","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/02/jason-kenny-british-cyclists-cycling-world-championships","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/jasonkenny","webTitle":"Jason Kenny","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jasonkenny","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/jasonkenny","references":[]},{"id":"sport/laura-trott","webTitle":"Laura Trott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/laura-trott","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/laura-trott","references":[]},{"id":"sport/becky-james","webTitle":"Becky James","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/becky-james","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/becky-james","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431116230","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393762246237/Jason-Kenny-008.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Luke Webber","altText":"Jason Kenny","height":"276","credit":"Luke Webber/PA","caption":"Jason Kenny, right, lost out to France's François Pervis in the men's individual sprint competition.

Laura Trott has the omnium still to come.</p><p>The day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/28/britain-women-team-pursuit-world-track-cycling-gold\" title=\"\">Jo Rowsell, Trott, Katie Archibald and Elinor Barker took gold in the team event</a>, Rowsell's solo performance over the 3,000m was a commanding one: she qualified fastest and exploited her strongest suit, her fast start, to take an early lead in the final against America's Sarah Hammer, the current world record holder who has dominated the discipline with five world titles since 2006.</p><p>Rowsell gained a second early on, and never faltered, which was good going for a rider who later said it had been \"touch and go\" whether she would get on the plane for Colombia after a chest infection. Like most track riders, she suffers from \"pursuiters' cough\" – the hacking cough that happens as the lungs cope with extreme effort in a dry, dusty velodrome– but her latest attack two weeks ago reacted badly with her asthma. \"I wasn't bed-bound, but I couldn't train. I missed three training sessions, which in hindsight perhaps did me good, gave me a bit more rest,\" she said.</p><p>It is the 25-year-old's first solo world title and it will make her the clear favourite for the title in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where the organisers have made a major error in not including a women's team event.</p><p>\"I am so excited for the Commonwealth Games,\" she said. \"I didn't do it last time in Delhi [2010] because I was ill with glandular fever. It's my first chance to train for individual pursuit, because we do all our training based around [the] team.\"</p><p>Rowsell also has her eyes on the road time trial in Glasgow, having won last year's national championship at the discipline on Scottish roads. \"We'll see how that goes nearer the time. If, as it gets closer to the event, I think the pursuit's suffering, I'll prioritise the pursuit. I'd love to compete in both of those, though.\"</p><p>Rowsell has been Britain's undisputed star of the opening phase, but the sprinters have held their end up with a bronze for Becky James and Varnish in the team event; the pair were unlucky to meet in the quarter-final of the match sprint where Varnish deprived James of a chance to retain her title. One of the most positive notes for British hopes in the longer term is that Cali looks to have marked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/26/jess-varnish-troubled-year-world-cup\" title=\"\">Varnish's definitive return to form after a back injury that put her out for five months last year</a>.</p><p>In contrast to the women, the men have endured a torrid start to the championships, although Ed Clancy has a chance of a medal in the omnium after ending the first day in sixth place with the three events that favour him remaining. There will be another medal chance in the men's match sprint with the Olympic champion, Jason Kenny.</p><p>In the first three days, however, the team sprinters' fifth place fell short of the standard they set for themselves at Olympic Games while the rest of the world, led by the New Zealanders and the Germans, have moved forward since London. The world title that has eluded them since 2005 remains as distant as ever, while Kenny fell foul of the random nature of the keirin in his defence of the title he won last year, being baulked by a crash in the final en route to fifth.</p><p>The biggest worry for the Great Britain team, however, is among the men's endurance events. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/27/world-track-championships-mens-pursuit-failure\" title=\"\">The team pursuit quartet's eighth place in their qualifying round </a>was their lowest since lottery funding began in 1998, which will give some pause for reflection two years out from Rio.</p><p>In the non-Olympic solo endurance disciplines – the scratch, points and individual pursuit – Britain have been well behind the pace set by other nations including Ireland, who do not have an indoor velodrome to train in and function on a minuscule budget yet have come away with a silver medal for Martyn Irvine in the scratch race and an encouraging fourth for the youngster Ryan Mullen in the pursuit.</p>","headline":"Gold star Jo Rowsell: 'I am so excited for the Commonwealth Games'","trailText":"While Great Britain's men stumbled in the first three days of the world track championships in Cali, Colombia, and have yet to win a medal with only a few chances remaining, the women have been the stars of the show","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/1/1393686424996/Jo-Rowsell-GB-cyclist-at--006.jpg","wordcount":"743","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-04T15:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/01/gold-jo-rowsell-commonwealth-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/01/gold-jo-rowsell-commonwealth-games","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/commonwealthgames2014","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/commonwealthgames2014","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/commonwealthgames2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/sport","webTitle":"Observer Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431040911","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/1/1393686414832/Jo-Rowsell-GB-cyclist-at--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Luke Webber","altText":"Jo Rowsell, GB cyclist, at world track champs in Cali","height":"54","credit":"Luke Webber/PA","caption":"Britain's Jo Rowsell celebrates her individual pursuit gold at the world track championships in Cali, Colombia.

I love having a big target to work towards. I missed the worlds last year out of personal choice, just to have a break, but I've been raring to go for this ever since this time last year. This time last year I was training with this in mind.\"</p><p>In February Rowsell spent a period isolated from the rest of the squad. \"I was ill with a chest infection two weeks ago so I missed three team training sessions, which in hindsight perhaps did me good, gave me a bit more rest,\" she added.</p><p>\"I wasn't bed-bound but I couldn't train. I get pursuiter's cough and that's common but I have asthma and it just affected me really badly and developed into a chest infection.\"</p><p>The enforced break had a positive effect as Rowsell recorded a personal best of three minutes, 30.318 seconds in the non-Olympic event to beat Hammer, who clocked 3min 31.535secs.</p><p>\"I woke up this morning feeling good, which is unusual after two 4k team pursuits the day before, riding from man one,\" she said. \"But I felt I had good legs on the rollers this morning and thought: 'This is a good sign.'</p><p>\"I was really pleased with my qualifying ride, just two 10ths off my PB, but I can't believe that ride just now. That's a new personal best for me on pretty much an outdoor track, five-spoke wheel, cooler conditions – everybody else went slower. I can't believe I've done it, I can't believe I went that quick.\"</p><p>The victory was built from the start as Rowsell was more than a second quicker than her rival after 500m and managed to hold the margin.</p><p>\"My start's my strength,\" she said. \"It isn't the conventional way of pursuiting but if I can use my strength, get some time in the bank early on and then hang on.\"</p><p>After achieving a long-held goal, Rowsell will target another in the summer, when she bids for Commonwealth Games glory in the individual pursuit in Glasgow, where she also hopes to ride the road time trial.</p><p>\"I'm so excited for the Commonwealth Games,\" she added. \"I didn't do it last time in Delhi because I was ill with glandular fever. It's my first chance to train for individual pursuit because we do all our training based around team pursuiting. That'll be a different challenge.\"</p><p>Becky James was unable to defend her women's sprint title after being beaten 2-0 by team-mate Jess Varnish in the quarter-finals.</p><p>Varnish won the second bout after tumbling to the track when stationary on the back straight. James shared a hug with her team-mate afterwards and was angry at herself for her tactical selection.</p><p>The 22-year-old from Abergavenny, who responded by winning the race for fifth, said: \"I've no idea why we decided to go for those tactics. It's upsetting because I wanted to defend my world title, especially after qualifying second. My legs felt great today.\"</p><p>James will bid to defend her Keirin title on Sunday. \"I wish it was now,\" she said. There were no hard feelings with Varnish.</p><p>James explained: \"Really good friends off the track and worst enemies on the track. That's how sport is. We've both been practising track standing and slow riding together in Manchester. When I felt her hit my back wheel and I just saw her tumble we both had a bit of a giggle.\"</p><p>James was in good company because the Olympic champion, Anna Meares of Australia, was also eliminated, with her conqueror Zhong Tianshi of China meeting Varnish in the semi-finals.</p><p>The loudest cheer was for Edwin Avila, who won the men's points race in his home town. Ireland's Martyn Irvine was sixth.</p><p>At the halfway point in the men's omnium, London 2012 bronze medallist Ed Clancy was sixth, with France's Thomas Boudat leading. Clancy won the flying lap, was 13th in the points race and eighth in the elimination race.</p>","headline":"Joanna Rowsell clinches gold in world track cycling individual pursuit","trailText":"Britain's Joanna Rowsell bounced back from a chest infection to beat defending champion Sarah Hammer and win the three-kilometre event in Cali, Colombia.","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/1/1393667329654/Joanna-Rowsell-celebrates-003.jpg","wordcount":"791","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-04T09:58:06Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/01/joanna-rowsell-gold-track-cycling-world-championships-cali-colombia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/mar/01/joanna-rowsell-gold-track-cycling-world-championships-cali-colombia","tags":[{"id":"sport/jess-varnish","webTitle":"Jess Varnish","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jess-varnish","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/jess-varnish","references":[]},{"id":"sport/becky-james","webTitle":"Becky James","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/becky-james","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/becky-james","references":[]},{"id":"sport/ed-clancy","webTitle":"Ed Clancy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ed-clancy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/ed-clancy","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431045805","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/1/1393667328423/Joanna-Rowsell-celebrates-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Jose Miguel Gomez","altText":"Joanna Rowsell celebrates a gold in the individual pursuit at the track cycling world championships","height":"130","credit":"Jose Miguel Gomez/Reuters","caption":"Britain's Joanna Rowsell celebrates winning gold in the women's individual pursuit at the track cycling world championships in Cali, Colombia.

I&nbsp;currently have brown hair, but I&nbsp;tend to swap between brown and blond, depending on how I feel. My&nbsp;natural colour is deep blond. My face is normal-looking: it's quite round, with thin eyebrows, blue eyes, small lips and goofy teeth. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;quite gummy when I&nbsp;smile, and&nbsp;my friends used to call me Bugs&nbsp;Bunny – now it's only my boyfriend who does that. I did have a brace, but I&nbsp;made the mistake of not wearing my retainers, so my teeth soon moved back.</p><p>I am very short – 5ft 4in – and my best features are my legs and abs. I like my tummy. My mum started cycling to lose weight, so that's how my sister (Emma, also a&nbsp;professional cyclist) and I got into it – I was eight and she was 11.</p><p>I've always been girly but, wearing Lycra, you don't really feel like a girl, so I wear makeup all the time, even when I ride my bike. I like bronzing powder – I don't wear foundation, because my skin is clear – liquid eyeliner, waterproof mascara and coral lipstick.</p><p>I have had a few requests to model, and FHM asked me to the Sexiest Woman in the World awards,&nbsp;but I don't want to be associated with that whole thing. I&nbsp;am 21 and I want girls to look up to me as a sportswoman.

You get lucky sometimes I guess, and that’s what happened.” </p><p>Barker said: “I just could not hold those wheels. I completely parked it up. </p><p>“It was a split-second decision. I just had to get out of the way and let the girls carry on with it. It was that close that we just would’ve lost it if I’d stayed on the front.” </p><p>Olympic champions Britain had won five of six world titles when the event was over three kilometres and with three riders – silver in 2010 the only blot on the record – and their dominance had shown little sign of abating with the addition of an extra kilometre and an extra rider this season. </p><p>But despite being world record holders and clear favourites, Britain felt under pressure from Canada in a close-run final. </p><p>Barker said: “We could feel them breathing down our necks a little bit, but we managed to pull it back in the end.” </p><p>Archibald has been a revelation after joining the squad full-time at their Manchester training base in November, and was selected ahead of London 2012 gold medallist Dani King, who was a reserve. </p><p>The 19-year-old from Milngavie, with red, white and blue dyed hair, became Scotland’s first female world champion. </p><p>She said: “For a long time there’s been the pressure of living up to your team-mates and knowing that they’ve been Olympic champions, world champions, time and time again and so it’s good to have someone on your heels, not just bumping elbows with your team-mates.” </p><p>Rowsell also paid tribute to King’s contribution. “She could’ve easily slotted in, but didn’t quite make the selection, but she’s been awesome support all week,” Rowsell said. </p><p>Defending champion Jason Kenny had to settle for fifth in the men’s Keirin behind France’s Francois Pervis, while Fabian Puerta of Colombia was roared on to silver. </p><p>Kenny recognised his bid was over after a collision in which Germany’s Maximilian Levy tumble to the track. </p><p>The 25-year-old from Bolton, who has a day off on Friday before the two-day sprint competition this weekend, said: “[The crash] just left me floating around at the top of the track and totally out of the race.” </p><p>Head coach Shane Sutton had targeted a haul of six medals from the 10 Olympic events and Kenny’s result meant Britain had two medals from five Olympic events with five remaining. </p><p>Becky James’s run of world championship medals came to an end as she finished seventh in the women’s 500m time-trial, a non-Olympic discipline. </p><p>The 22-year-old from Abergavenny had won medals in five successive world championship events – four in 2013 in Minsk and a team sprint bronze on day one alongside Jess Varnish – before competing in the two-lap event. </p><p>Despite a personal best of 34.021 she had to settle for a minor placing as Miriam Welte of Germany won gold in 33.451. </p><p>Ireland’s Martyn Irvine claimed silver in the men’s 15km (60-laps) scratch race as Ivan Kovalev of Russia won gold. Irvine fought valiantly in defence of his title, but ultimately came up short. </p><p>“I’m getting a bit of a greedy head – I always want gold now, but I’ll take silver,” Irvine said. </p><p>Ireland’s Ryan Mullen was fourth in the men’s individual pursuit in 4:24.626 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/28/alex-edmondson-world-track-cycling-gold-individual-pursuit\">Alex Edmondson (4:22.582) of Australia won gold</a>.</p>","headline":"Britain win team pursuit world track cycling gold in a nail-biter","trailText":"Women maintain Britain’s dominant record in the event at the world titles, but only after final lap drama","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393559175184/c265f82b-1813-4fd2-b5f7-bf6fbdbcdbad-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"707","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-03T03:52:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/28/britain-women-team-pursuit-world-track-cycling-gold","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/feb/28/britain-women-team-pursuit-world-track-cycling-gold","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-c95d2eb8-536e-4f21-900a-0857397af5e8","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393559174659/c265f82b-1813-4fd2-b5f7-bf6fbdbcdbad-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393559174659/c265f82b-1813-4fd2-b5f7-bf6fbdbcdbad-220x132.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon","altText":"Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell show off their medals.","height":"132","credit":"Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","caption":"Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell show off their medals.

In both the 1999 and 1998 world championships they finished fifth, making the Cali ride their worst since lottery funding began to transform the squad in 1998. It also compares poorly with their performances at similar points in previous Olympic cycles. In the 2010 world championship in Copenhagen they took silver to Australia by .25sec, in 2006 at Bordeaux they took silver by 0.036sec to Australia, while in 2002, again in Copenhagen, they ended up with bronze after narrowly missing out on the gold-silver ride-off.</p><p>Hunt, who is now the Premier League's head of elite performance, said: \"You need to look at the ride they did in qualifying rather than compare their time with the winners, as having an extra team on the track makes a difference in the final.\" GB qualified eighth, with a time of 4min 04.419sec compared to Denmark's 4:00.176.</p><p>\"What concerns me is the quality of the teams in front of them. Being beaten by Germany, Switzerland and Spain is worrying. Looking at the splits I'd say the wheels came off in the last kilometre, but that's when the effects of altitude kick in.</p><p>\"The one thing they won't do is hit the panic button, but they will clinically reflect on what they've done in the last few months. They'll be disappointed, but they know what improvements to make as the Commonwealth Games and Rio come into view. They've had some bad luck, maybe not had a great winter.\"</p><p>The sense of disappointment for Great Britain was reinforced by the fact that the team pursuit has been regarded for many years as the most prestigious endurance title on the track, reflecting as it does a nation's strength in depth.</p><p>The discipline has largely been a two-horse race in recent years with Great Britain and Australia dominant, with New Zealand, Denmark and Russia the other powerhouses. Cali, however, marked a resurgence for the Danes, thanks partly to the return of Alex Rasmussen after an 18-month ban for missing drugs tests, and to the emergence of the powerful rider Lasse Norman Hansen.</p><p>In Cali, Great Britain fielded only one of the five-man squad that dominated the discipline in 2012. Ed Clancy was the only survivor with his fellow London gold medallist Stephen Burke put out by illness along with Andy Tennant, who was part of the squad that took gold in the Melbourne world championship in 2012, but missed out on a ride in London. The two other London medallists, Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh, are now devoting their attention to road racing full-time.</p><p>\"Behind the scenes we've had some problems,\" admitted Ed Clancy, who also won gold in the Beijing Games in the discipline. \"We knew a week ago we had our backs against the wall. [Andy] Tennant's not here, and he usually goes pretty good. Burkey is a pretty low-profile guy, but when we set our world record in London he was our strongest rider. We have tried a different approach for these track worlds and perhaps it hasn't quite paid off.\"</p><p>With Tennant and Burke out, Clancy was joined by three younger riders, the 21-year old Sam Harrison and two 20-year-olds, Jon Dibben and Owain Doull. However, the world champions in Cali, Australia, also fielded a mix of youth and experience, with three riders under 23 in their five-man squad.</p><p>One problem Great Britain face is that having made winning look straightforward – if not easy – medals are now expected of them. \"What this shows is that every one of those medals in the past was very hard fought,\" said Hunt.</p>","headline":"Men's team pursuit failure sends GB Cycling's Rio preparation off track","trailText":"<p><strong>William Fotheringham:</strong> The British quartet's worst world track championships finish since 1998 is a cause of concern for the coach who guided them to gold at London 2012</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/2/27/1393508897436/Team-pursuit-004.jpg","wordcount":"709","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-02T14:01:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/27/world-track-championships-mens-pursuit-failure","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/feb/27/world-track-championships-mens-pursuit-failure","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-430960169","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/2/27/1393508891255/Team-pursuit-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Luke Webber","altText":"Team pursuit","height":"54","credit":"Luke Webber/PA","caption":"Head coach Shane Sutton, left, talks to Ed Clancy, right, after the men's team pursuit lineup failed to qualify for the finals.

Kenny, who will bid to defend his Keirin title on day two, tried to accentuate the positive after the 43.617 seconds ride. </p><p>\"It is frustrating for me,\" the 25-year-old said. \"I've got a lot of medals in this event over the years, not many of them gold. We've got the Olympic gold medals, which is the main ones. We've got the potential to dominate, or certainly to be competitive every time we go out and that's where I'd like to be really. </p><p>\"We're disappointed with the result, but the time itself and the way we rode wasn't that bad.  We've got a lot closer to the lead than we have been. The New Zealand guys were out in front by a little bit of a margin, but everyone else was quite tight.  It's just unfortunate everyone is so tight and we just slipped out the second ride.\" </p><p>New Zealand qualified fastest and Ethan Mitchell, Sam Webster and Ed Dawkins won the final in 42.840sec ahead of Germany (42.885sec). </p><p>In the corresponding women's event, Varnish and James won the ride-off for bronze ahead of Russia, clocking 33.032sec. </p><p>\"It was a solid performance tonight,\" Varnish said.  \"It's a really different track to what we've ridden on and you can't really compare it to other performances. I think we should be happy.

The downpours left an access tunnel flooded and put the track out of action while the wooden boards dried out, leading to speculation that the championship might be disrupted or, at worst, cancelled, if the weather persists.</p><p>Since the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, the last major event to be held on an outdoor velodrome, the UCI has had a policy of running major championships only on indoor tracks to avoid disruption by the weather, but Cali is a compromise: an outdoor track with a temporary roof that is open at the sides. In Tuesday's training session the wind drove the torrential rain under the roof, leaving the track glistening and slippery and temporarily too dangerous to ride on. The championships are due to start on Wednesday.</p><p>Amid pictures of mopping up – scenes that were reminiscent of the recent British floods – the Great Britain sprint head coach, Iain Dyer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iaindyer1\" title=\"\">vented his frustration on Twitter</a>. \"Following the MCR [Manchester] World Cup we've not had one venue in two further WCups (both Mexico) &amp; now the World Championships that reach acceptable stds,\" said Dyer, adding, \"Shame the UCI can't stick to its own rules and hold the W Champs indoors.\"</p><p>Dyer had already stated his concerns after the World Cup at Aguascalientes in Mexico in December, which he described to the Guardian afterwards as being \"totally inappropriate as a competition venue\" because of limited access to the track centre, making it hard for paramedics to get to riders who had crashes, and a lack of guardrails at the top of the track.</p><p>Coming as they do midway through the Olympic cycle, the Cali championships should offer the Great Britain staff a chance to assess the work that has to be done before Rio 2016. \"It's a line in the sand, a marker of where we're at against the rest of the world,\" said the performance director, Dave Brailsford. \"And that will then guide us going forward into the next phase. It's always an interesting time in an Olympic cycle. You're not looking back any more but there is still opportunity to change, to hone it to where we want to be.\"</p><p>On the opening day, Great Britain will want to know the extent of their team sprinter Jess Varnish's recovery from the back injury that kept her out for many months after the London Games. However, the performance of the men's trio will be just as closely scrutinised after their fifth place last year in Minsk showed they are struggling to come to terms with the departure of the iconic Sir Chris Hoy, who will accompany GB in Cali as a mentor.</p><p>Great Britain have taken the last two Olympic titles in the men's team sprint but have not won a world championship since 2005, something that has left their senior figure, Jason Kenny, increasingly frustrated. \"We have not been going that slowly but everyone else seems to have made a step up and we have been left behind a little bit, so we have been chasing.</p><p>\"The Germans have made a real step forward and destroyed the world record – our world record – in Mexico and they destroyed us in Mexico along with it. They definitely seem to have picked their game up this year. The French have been consistently right at the top for years and years and then behind those two you have got us, the Australians, the Russians, all snapping at their heels. We have not got any particular weakness as such. It is not like we are losing all our time in the first half or the last half or the middle, we are just losing it all. All the way round we are haemorrhaging time – it is pretty depressing in that sense.\"</p><p>There is also speculation over the role of Brailsford, as the performance director concedes he is finding it \"more and more difficult\" to reconcile his twin roles of heading the Olympic programme and the Team Sky professional squad. There are rumours that he is likely to scale back his involvement with British Cycling – this will be the second track Worlds in a row he has opted to miss – and he concedes he will review his role after the championships.</p><p>\"The thing I am concerned about is to make sure the British cycling team is in the best possible shape it could be heading into Rio and that I feel that I'm contributing fully to make sure that happens. And that the appropriate structure is in place to make sure that happens. In other words, if I was occupying a space and for whatever reason I didn't feel I was optimising what I could do, then I would change my role so that someone could be maximising that particular part.\"</p><p>If Brailsford does indeed opt for Team Sky over GB when his team have left Colombia behind, the phrase '<em>après moi, le déluge</em>' will apply to rather more than the Cali thunderstorms.</p>","headline":"Great Britain look to weather Cali storms amid pre-Olympic speculation","trailText":"In the buildup to Rio and with other nations leading the way, speculation continues about the future of Dave Brailsford after the world track championships in Colombia","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/2/25/1393350617038/The-British-mens-team-spr-006.jpg","wordcount":"858","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-28T22:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/25/great-britain-cali-olympic-rio-world-track-championships-colombia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/feb/25/great-britain-cali-olympic-rio-world-track-championships-colombia","tags":[{"id":"sport/dave-brailsford","webTitle":"Dave Brailsford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/dave-brailsford","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/dave-brailsford","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-430730849","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/2/25/1393350603744/The-British-mens-team-spr-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Luke Webber/British Cycling","altText":"The British men's team sprint squad train for the world track championships in Cali, Colombia","height":"54","credit":"Luke Webber/British Cycling/PA","caption":"The British men's team sprint squad of, left to right, Philip Hindes, Kian Emadi and Jason Kenny train for the world track championships in Cali, Colombia.

You wait years for one to come along, and then you get two, one right after the other. Two British victors of cycling's toughest event back to back might seem an outlandish idea, but Dave Brailsford, Team Sky, Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins have managed to make it seem routine at the same time.</p><p>In July 2009, Team Sky was merely a series of spreadsheets, random jottings, and what the team's founders term \"brain dumps\" as Brailsford and his associates tried to figure out how to start a professional cycling team. They had little idea of what they were getting into. But this July Froome started as the overwhelming Tour favourite, led the race from the end of week one, and never looked likely to be beaten. Wiggins did exactly the same in 2012.</p><p>It has taken four years, but that is not a coincidence: four years is an Olympic cycle, the time frame in which British Cycling, the UK's governing body, and its performance director, Brailsford, have tended to function since the arrival of lottery funding into the sport in 1997. Britain's Tour de France domination stems directly from its record Olympic medal hauls, which drew in the big money from Sky – James Murdoch is an active cyclist and turns up to races intermittently – and gave Brailsford the knowledge base from which to climb cycling's Everest: the Tour.</p><p>The Sky goal was to dominate road cycling using the same methods that had brought Olympic success, most notably the \"aggregation of marginal gains\", where every area is examined in minute detail for possible improvement, and the cumulative effect of many small gains gives a considerable advance on the opposition. Sky would also use the people-management principles devised by Steve Peters, the \"mechanic of the mind\", a psychiatrist who had worked at Rampton mental hospital.</p><p>The first year was a struggle. The \"marginal gains\" that Sky brought to cycling initially made it the butt of derision. Its special set-up at time-trial stages, with non-slip matting laid out so the cyclists wouldn't slip in their custom-made carbon-fibre soled shoes, took hours to set up – and other teams would laugh at them as they toiled away.</p><p>Attempts to use weather modelling to locate training camps and decide Wiggins' start time in a Tour time trial fell spectacularly flat. Staff would moan about the extra effort it took lugging the riders' custom-made bedding in and out of hotels every night. There were tensions among riders and staff, with European hirings struggling to fit in with British Cycling's methods. Key members left; there were complaints about constant meetings.</p><p>The ridicule and mutterings lasted only as long as it took for Sky to start winning, and since the end of 2011 it has been a trail of success, not just in the Tour but in other stage races. By then Sky's training guru, Tim Kerrison, had begun putting together a radical programme that is at the root of Wiggins and Froome's successes: intense training at high altitude, reverse periodisation, which turned the idea of a gradual buildup to the Tour on its head, less racing and more training.</p><p></p><p>Rod Ellingworth, Sky's performance manager, and Kerrison put together a method of internal communication based on dropboxes, to compensate for the fact that Sky's 80 personnel were spread around Europe. Advanced planning and logistical systems were put in place. More training staff were hired, so that, uniquely in professional cycling, Sky's riders benefit from one-to-one training on a constant basis. \"You can see from this team how much you can get by investing relatively small amounts in coaching,\" Kerrison has told the Guardian. \"The gains are disproportionate.\"</p><p></p><p>Kerrison's computer modelling of the Tour's athletic demands meant the team could target precisely what training was needed to win the Tour.</p><p>There has been no let-up on the marginal gains front. The team's dietitian, Nigel Mitchell, has been a constant presence on the race, monitoring every gram the riders consume, including the fish oils, and fruit and vegetable shakes that are Sky staples. The fruits of Froome's work in a wind tunnel could be seen in his time-trial success and in the bursts of speed on the climbs that won him the race. And the Olympic link is as strong as ever: two of Sky's key team members, Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh, were gold medallists at the \"Pringle\" in London.</p><p>On Saturday, Froome spoke about his personal journey to Tour de France success, from pounding dirt tracks in Kenya as a teenager when he was unaware La Grande Boucle even existed. But the voyage taken by Brailsford and his cohorts from callow tyros to Tour tyrants is equally remarkable. The Sky head said before the Tour that in 2010 he would have given his right arm to see one of his cyclists make the podium in a major Tour; now the cycling world is scrabbling to catch up.</p>","headline":"Tour de France: how Team Sky climbed to the top and stayed there","trailText":"Back-to-back victories for Britain's Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins will realise Sky's aim of

When I was at school I&nbsp;wanted to go to the Côte d'Azur for holidays, like my schoolfriends. We went to the North Sea. My father, who was a grocer and one of 11 children, said: \"Don't look to those who go to the Côte D'Azur, but look to those who can't go the North Sea – keep your feet on the ground.\"</p><p><strong>I wanted to be a cyclist</strong> from the age of four. I listened to the Tour de France on the radio during the holidays. My teachers said: \"That's not a job\", but I was the Belgian amateur champion at 16 [he won 445 races as a pro].</p><p><strong>My earliest memory</strong> is my first crash on a&nbsp;bike. It was when I was four. My legs were going faster and faster until, in the end, they couldn't keep up with the pedals and I&nbsp;crashed spectacularly.</p><p><strong>The closest I have come to death</strong> was when I had my crash at the Blois outdoor vélodrome in central France in September 1969. I'd just won the Tour de France and I&nbsp;was racing behind my pacer, who was on a&nbsp;Derny [a custom-built motorbike]. He&nbsp;crashed into another bike and was killed. I&nbsp;hit him at full speed. I flew through the air, landing head first. I&nbsp;had nothing on my head – just sponge and leather. I twisted my hips and injured my back and I was never the same. I&nbsp;was always in pain, and still have treatment on my back every two months.</p><p><strong>I heard Sir </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/21/bradley-wiggins-never-ride-tour-de-france-again\" title=\"\"><strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong></a> made £6m last year. I'm not jealous about that, because I&nbsp;don't understand why cyclists aren't paid as much as footballers or tennis players or golfers, but if I could have made £6m in a&nbsp;year I wouldn't have ridden as much. You had to ride a lot back then to make money. When I started, I got a jersey and some equipment. Sometimes I would get the equivalent of €25 to enter a race and €15 prize money.</p><p><strong>I don't know how many races</strong> I was in over the years [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/16/eddy-merckx-william-fotheringham-review\" title=\"\">Merckx</a> competed in 1,413 races from 1966-77], but in 1975, the year I lost  the Tour de France, I did 195 races. I was racing everywhere.</p><p><strong>They called me the Cannibal.</strong> It was a&nbsp;young girl, the daughter of my old Peugeot teammate Christian Raymond, who gave me the name. We were on the start line and Christian said to her: \"This guy won't let us win anything – he wants everything for himself.\" She said: \"So he's a cannibal.\"</p><p><strong>When you are number one, </strong>the pressure is on you. It's not only physical but mental. You&nbsp;become tired.</p><p><strong>Cycling is a good school for life.</strong> It makes you hard and gives you ambition, but you can never say you've arrived.</p><p><strong>I don't like it when people say </strong>I was the best ever. It's silly. I am not the best ever. I was the best of my time. You cannot compare generations. There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/may/31/fausto-coppi\" title=\"\">Fausto Coppi</a> after the war, Anquetil, Hinault, Indurain, Fignon. I&nbsp;never rode for the glory. I rode because I&nbsp;like cycling and winning. But not to say I am the best.</p><p><strong>I made a big mistake in 1975</strong>, when I had a&nbsp;crash in the Tour de France and broke my jaw [he was also punched by a spectator but still finished second]. I should have retired from the race. I was exhausted.</p><p><strong>I am 68, but still ride every week</strong> with some friends, maybe 60km at a time, but we enjoy a glass of wine and some parma ham afterwards.</p>","headline":"Eddy Merckx: this much I know","trailText":"<p>The five-time winner of the Tour de France talks about a lifetime in the saddle, why he didn't race for glory and why he isn't jealous of today's winning cheques, says <strong>Andy Pietrasik</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372247892897/Cycling---Eddy-Merckx-003.jpg","wordcount":"590","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-02T18:30:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/29/eddy-merckx-this-much-i-know","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/29/eddy-merckx-this-much-i-know","tags":[{"id":"lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","webTitle":"This much I know","type":"series","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandhealth/series/thismuchiknow","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andypietrasik","webTitle":"Andy Pietrasik","r2ContributorId":"19142","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/01/andy_pietrasik1_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andy Pietrasik is head of travel at the Guardian.

The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p>","headline":"From the Observer archive, 4 July 1965: The man who makes the Tour de France's wheels turn","trailText":"<p><strong>Andrew Mulligan</strong> watches Jacques Goddet preside over the annual national jamboree that is the Tour de France</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335911794/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-005.jpg","wordcount":"684","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-27T11:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/france","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/agenda","webTitle":"Agenda","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","webTitle":"From the Observer archive","type":"series","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-411915569","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335908050/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Popperfoto","photographer":"Robert Delvac","altText":"Sunbathing Tour de France spectators","height":"54","credit":"Robert Delvac/Popperfoto","caption":"Sunbathers cheer passing riders on the sixth stage of the Tour de France near Quimper.

Bradley will return to the UK today for treatment and to rest and we hope to have him back on the road as soon as possible.</p><p>\"As a passionate racer he wanted to continue but he is simply unable to do so on medical grounds.\"</p><p>Team Sky had said that a decision would be taken first thing on Friday depending primarily on Wiggins's health but also on the weather, as further rain would be certain to affect him adversely. Rain was forecast for Friday morning in Emilia Romagna, the location of the stage start, together with winds gusting to 40km/h.</p><p>The risk was that by continuing to pursue what had become a lost cause, Wiggins might create more problems for his health in the long term. A prompt withdrawal at least means he can return for the Tour de France; there are opportunities for him to return to competition before then, including the Tour of Switzerland in late June, but the team will wait for a complete recovery before deciding on his programme.</p><p>Wiggins had made the sign of the cross to cycling fans at the finish of Wednesday's stage in Fruili; even though he was able to hang on to the leaders, he admitted that he had been ill for several days and had been taking antibiotics. He had limited his time loss on the first severe mountain-top finish of the race on Tuesday to just 37sec, inspiring hopes that he might still tilt for the podium.</p><p>The most likely cause for Wiggins's sickness is the rough weather which has followed the Giro as it has travelled from the south of the country to the north. While some cyclists thrive in the wet and cold, Wiggins has always been open about the fact that he is susceptible to such conditions.</p><p>The wet weather hit the Giro 10 days ago, on stage four, and Thursday was the fourth stage run in rain and cold; Wiggins had lost time on stages four and seven in the grim conditions. The forecast for the weekend's Alpine stages is for snow, with speculation that Sunday's finish on the Galibier will be cut short.</p><p>Wiggins was not the only winner of a Grand Tour from 2012 to quit the race; before the Briton's departure was confirmed, Garmin-Sharp announced that Hesjedal would not start Friday's stage. The Canadian had suffered immensely on Tuesday's stage in Friuli, and like Wiggins, the three-hour run on to the Veneto plains on Thursday proved too much for him.</p><p>\"There's a virus that's been going around, so it could be that, or severe allergies – whatever it is, I'm only getting worse,\" said Hesjedal in a statement released by his team. \"Yesterday's stage was just too much for me, I fought to get through it but after seeing the medical staff last night, I also know that its time for me to go home, get some tests done and get healthy again.</p>","headline":"Bradley Wiggins leaves Giro d'Italia","trailText":"Olympic gold medal cyclist to return home to recover from severe cold and chest infection that had left him lying 13th","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368775006804/Bradley-Wiggins-at-the-st-005.jpg","wordcount":"591","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-05-20T07:17:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/17/bradley-wiggins-leaves-giro-ditalia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/may/17/bradley-wiggins-leaves-giro-ditalia","tags":[{"id":"sport/bradleywiggins","webTitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/bradleywiggins","references":[]},{"id":"sport/giro-d-italia-2013","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia 2013","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/giro-d-italia-2013","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/giro-d-italia-2013","references":[]},{"id":"sport/giro-d-italia","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/giro-d-italia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/giro-d-italia","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-409034174","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368775003130/Bradley-Wiggins-at-the-st-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Gian Mattia D'Alberto","altText":"Bradley Wiggins at the start of Thursday's 12th stage of the Giro d'Italia","height":"54","credit":"Gian Mattia D'Alberto/AP","caption":"Bradley Wiggins at the start of Thursday's 12th stage of the Giro d'Italia on which he was left behind by the peloton.

Hoy has been a proud Scot all his career and it seems entirely typical of that he should choose to make his official farewell not far away from the mouldering old wooden Commonwealth Games stadium at Meadowbank, where he made his debut in track cycling in the&nbsp;early 1990s.</p><p>Since 7 August, when he won keirin gold in London and was saluted as he left the boards by a guard of honour consisting of all the Great Britain team staff, Hoy has officially been contemplating his future with a view to continuing as far as the Commonwealth Games next year in Glasgow, at the new velodrome which has been named after him. That decision, he said last November, would depend on whether he felt his body would hold out.</p><p>Senior figures within British Cycling have, however, felt recently that he would be hanging up his wheels some time this year. One indication that he would be quitting competition came in the last few weeks when his press officer Charlie Reid, who has run his media engagements since the Beijing Games, was quietly moved to other duties.</p><p>Hoy has also been dealing with his newly launched bike range, and motor racing. Nothing has pointed to a resumption of training. At the world championships in Minsk in February, it was clear that the British sprint staff were looking for a new rider to take over Hoy's place in the team sprint.</p><p>It seems likely that Hoy has made the decision on two grounds: first, he is unlikely to make a better farewell than his spectacular gold medal in the keirin in London. If he were to continue to Glasgow next August, there would be a risk that a younger opponent might show him up. Given the reputation of the track head coach Shane Sutton for plain speaking, this may well have been&nbsp;put to him.</p><p>Also, in the runup to London, Hoy's body was buckling. It was kept quiet – for obvious reasons – but the updated version of his autobiography published after the Games made it clear that he was carrying a back injury between the world championships in Melbourne in April, and the Olympics.</p><p>Between Beijing and London he also broke a rib while weight training, and had a big crash at the Copenhagen World&nbsp;Cup in February 2009 that injured&nbsp;his hip.</p><p>Hoy's departure will mark the end of an era: he is one of the last members of the Olympic cycling team who competed in the distant era before lottery funding arrived in 1997 to transform the sport. He was one of a group of sprinters, together with Jason Queally and Craig Maclean, who were given funding soon after lottery cash arrived, and they broke through at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 with a silver medal in the team sprint to go with Queally's gold in the kilometre time trial. Since then he has spearheaded the British squad's rise to world domination.</p><p>Hoy's first world titles came in 2002 in Copenhagen, where he triumphed in the kilometre, and he followed that up with gold at the discipline in the Athens Olympics. When the time trial was dropped from the Olympic programme he reinvented himself as a keirin and match-sprint rider in time for Beijing, using his immense strength to ride from the front in a dominating style that was completely novel at the time.</p><p>That earned him a spectacular hat-trick of gold medals at the Beijing Games, which in turn led to his election as BBC Sports Personality of the Year for&nbsp;2008. By this stage he was established as the father figure in the British track team, seen as the exemplar of commitment and discipline, as well as ultra-competitiveness, which was the template for the younger squad members.</p><p>By the run-in to London, Hoy's position in the match sprint was under threat from Beijing silver medallist Jason Kenny, and the younger man was given the nod in June.</p><p>But in April, Hoy had taken his fourth keirin world title in six years, showing when he emerged from the pack in a daring move on the final banking that he had broadened his skills, and could now win from almost anywhere on the track.</p><p>That epic moment set up what now looks to have been the final flourish, the&nbsp;highlight of the London velodrome racing in August. If Hoy confirms his departure on Thursday, that will have been one hell of an exit, befitting one of&nbsp;the greatest British Olympians.</p><h2>Hoy's golds</h2><p><strong>Olympic Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Athens 2004 </strong>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Beijing 2008 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff); keirin; sprint</p><p><strong>London 2012 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes); keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>World Championships</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2002 </strong>1km time trial; team sprint (with Craig MacLean and Staff)</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2004</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Los Angeles 2005</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Jason Queally and Staff)</p><p><strong>Bordeaux 2006</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Palma 2007</strong></p><p>Keirin, 1km time trial</p><p><strong>Manchester 2008</strong></p><p>Sprint, keirin</p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2010</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2012</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>Commonwealth Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Manchester 2002</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2006</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Ross Edgar, and Craig MacLean)</p><p></p><p>Hoy has also achieved one Olympic silver medal, eight World Championship silver medals and nine world championship bronze medals.</p>","headline":"Chris Hoy to retire from cycling after 13 years on top","trailText":"Olympian who spearheaded British dominance in the sport expected to quit after remarkable career in the velodrome","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/15/1366046430631/Chris-Hoy-005.jpg","wordcount":"909","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-04-18T17:42:50Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/chris-hoy-retire-cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/apr/15/chris-hoy-retire-cycling","tags":[{"id":"sport/chrishoy","webTitle":"Sir Chris Hoy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chrishoy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/chrishoy","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/sport","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-407237842","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/15/1366046425836/Chris-Hoy-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Tom Jenkins","altText":"Chris Hoy","height":"54","credit":"Tom Jenkins","caption":"Chris Hoy celebrates winning the sixth Olympic gold of his career in the keirin final at London 2012, his swansong.

cycling group hopes to build on 2012's track success to get UK pedalling up European tables of bike use","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>It was a mantra heard time and again amid the cosy fug of 2012's British sporting success: with a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/22/bradley-wiggins-tour-de-france-cavendish\" title=\"\">Tour de France title</a>, another <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/cycling-track/medals/\" title=\"\">clutch of Olympic golds</a> and Bradley Wiggins <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/17/bradley-wiggins-sports-personality-year\" title=\"\">our sports personality of the year</a>, we were now officially a nation of cyclists.</p><p>Except we're not. Exclude racing or tourism and Britons are near the bottom of just about every European cycling ranking. Just 2.2% of people use a bike as their main means of transport, lower than all but a handful of EU nations such as Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus.</p><p>Other statistics are equally damning. About 2% of British children ride to school, compared with 40% in Denmark and 20% in Sweden. Almost three-quarters of British cyclists are men, a statistic that speaks of a macho, gung-ho cycling culture where riders are expected to mix it with speeding cars, buses and trucks.</p><p>\"When it comes to cycling as everyday transport the UK is so far down the table it's almost scary,\" said Kevin Mayne, director of development at the Brussels-based <a href=\"http://www.ecf.com/\" title=\"\">European Cyclists' Federation</a>. \"With all these Olympic medals people maybe have this idea that the UK is doing OK in cycling. But it's not.\"</p><p>And yet cycling advocates hope things could be about to change. This week is the start of a <a href=\"http://allpartycycling.org/inquiry/\" title=\"\">pioneering parliamentary inquiry</a> into how best to get Britons on their bikes, building on the momentum from last summer's sporting triumphs and an <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/\" title=\"\">energetic cycle safety campaign by the Times</a>. All three main party leaders have signed up. Expectations are growing that Downing Street could be on the verge of making a significant commitment.</p><p>\"It's all to play for,\" said Roger Geffen, policy director of national cycling lobby group the <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CTC</a> and among those giving evidence to the <a href=\"http://allpartycycling.org/\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary cycling group</a> (APPCG) of MPs and peers, which has organised the hearings. \"The inquiry is hugely timely and hopefully it paves the way for some sort of high-level announcement from government.\"</p><p>The first of the inquiry's six evidence sessions starts on Wednesday, taking the views of experts, government departments, cycling luminaries such as the Olympic champion-turned bike builder <a href=\"http://www.boardmanbikes.com/boardman/index.html\" title=\"\">Chris Boardman</a> and members of the media, including the Guardian. It is hoped David Cameron or Nick Clegg will appear.</p><p>Ian Austin, the Labour MP for Dudley North who co-chairs the APPCG, said the plan was to turn 2012's generalised rhetorical enthusiasm into definite commitments. \"We want a detailed report with some very clear recommendations, which we can then ask all the political parties to sign up to. If we can get the party leaders to commit to cycling in advance of the election we can make some real progress.\"</p><p>It has long been a policy truism that more cycling is good for all: carbon emissions fall, road congestion eases, people get fitter. Equally accepted is how to bring this about, using a template devised by the Dutch and Danes and tested in dozens of cities.</p><p>To get cycling mainstream, experts agree, you need wholesale investment in infrastructure, most obviously well-designed and continuous cycle lanes, separated from faster traffic by a kerb or other barrier and with cyclists offered protection at junctions. The philosophy was summed up by <a href=\"http://www.enriquepenalosa.com/\" title=\"\">Enrique Peñalosa</a>, who as mayor of Bogotá revolutionised transport in the Colombian capital: \"A bicycle way that is not safe for an eight-year-old is not a bicycle way.\"</p><p>Without this, according to Mayne, cycling never expands beyond an intrepid core of mainly young, predominantly male riders: \"The studies show you more or less never drop below 1% of people who cycle, and this can rise to maybe 5% or 6% without infrastructure. But anything more than this needs the cyclists catered for. That means high-quality lanes, probably segregated on main highways. It means speed management, massive investment in cycle parking so every cycling trip is possible. It certainly means getting hugely behind women and children cycling.\"</p><p>Such a commitment has been beyond the imagination, let alone daring, of successive British governments faced by a powerful and aggressive motoring lobby and a wider public who, studies show, still largely see cycling as a leisure pursuit or worse, see a bike as a child's toy.</p><p>It would require considerable investment. In a paper submitted to the inquiry, <a href=\"http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/aldred-rachel\" title=\"\">Rachel Aldred</a>, a London academic specialising in cycling, estimated a cost of just over £1.1bn a year for cycling to even begin the process of catching up with other nations, seemingly a lot but marginal set against the £16bn cost of just one rail project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/29/crossrail-train-manufacturing-contract\" title=\"\">Crossrail</a>.</p><p>\"Relatively, cycling is extraordinarily cheap,\" said Mayne. \"Cycling schemes routinely pay back their investment in one to three years. Your average road scheme pays back on paper in 20 years but usually doesn't pay back at all. You can hit your climate change targets, your health targets, everything else. It's a no-brainer.\"</p><p>While Britain is littered with bike lanes they are almost universally piecemeal and substandard, often just a narrow strip of paint inches from speeding traffic. London and a handful of other places, notably Brighton and Southampton, are now <a href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/cycling/cs5\" title=\"\">proposing limited Dutch-style segregated schemes</a>. More of the same is vital, according to Mayne: \"If you're given a fixed amount of money do you do one thing well or lots of things badly? You do the one thing well. If you spend every penny you've got on a high-quality segregated lane it will attract people and you can build confidence on that route.\"</p><p>Geffen, however, argues that even poorly designed lanes have a purpose in gradually building up cyclist levels to a point where the momentum of opinion is sufficient to begin making bold choices.</p><p>\"Good infrastructure is vital but even that only goes so far,\" said Geffen. \"At some point, if you're going to have room for all these new bikes and bikes lanes, you have to start talking about ways to reduce traffic levels. That's where delivering on cycling really gets difficult.\"</p>","headline":"Cycling in Britain: government to get serious with all-party inquiry","trailText":"<p>Parliamentary cycling group hopes to build on 2012's track success to get UK pedalling up European tables of bike use</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/20/1358687786110/Woman-cycles-in-London-tr-005.jpg","wordcount":"970","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-23T13:17:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/20/cycling-in-britain-government-inquiry","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jan/20/cycling-in-britain-government-inquiry","tags":[{"id":"politics/transport","webTitle":"Transport policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/transport","references":[]},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/health","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/health","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/fitness","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","references":[]},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/policy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/policy","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/transport","webTitle":"Transport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/transport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

Lance Armstrong's extended appearance on the Oprah Winfrey network, in which the man stripped of seven Tour de France wins finally admitted to doping, has opened him up to several multi-million dollar legal challenges.</p><p>According to reports, the US government may join a \"whistleblower\" lawsuit launched by Armstrong's former colleague, Floyd Landis, on the grounds that Armstrong, while riding for the US Postal Service team, defrauded the American taxpayer. The <em>Sunday Times </em>is set to try to claw back nearly £1m in damages and costs that Armstrong was awarded after he sued it over allegations of doping. A Texas-based sports marketing firm is also suing Armstrong to get back millions of dollars in bonuses it paid out to the cyclist.</p><p>Meanwhile, the International Cycling Union is urging Armstrong to pay back his prize money, and even Australian government officials are reportedly mulling over going to the courts to get back hefty fees paid for appearances in the country from 2009 to 2011. Finally, and perhaps most seriously, Armstrong's confession has opened up the prospect that he might be prosecuted for perjury after previously testifying under oath that he had not taken drugs.</p><p>In seeking public rehabilitation, and a second chance to compete, it is possible that Armstrong has in fact dug himself into a deeper hole than he imagined.</p><p>His emotional mea culpa last week was an audacious move. But the man who beat cancer and regularly – with illegal help – triumphed over any rival on his bike seems to have failed to beat his toughest opponent: public opinion.</p><p>The hours of dialogue with Winfrey, which culminated in a choked-up moment on Friday night as he discussed the impact of his cheating on his family, appear to have failed to give Armstrong the redemption that he craves.</p><p>His confession, which many believe is aimed at reducing his ban from competitive sports and allowing him to take part in triathlons, has been greeted with dismay and criticism. Few critics and fellow athletes who watched his  display have extended the hand of sympathy.</p><p>\"Armstrong said he was sorry for all the years of lying, but he sounded like he was reading a shopping list,\" retorted Howard Kurtz, the media critic for cable news TV station CNN.</p><p>Indeed, part of the problem was that Armstrong was rowing back on so much previous behaviour and years of aggressive lambasting of reporters, officials and team-mates who had claimed he was doping. \"I don't forgive Lance Armstrong, who lied to me in two interviews. And I suspect most of America won't, either,\" Kurtz wrote.</p><p>That was a common sentiment. Many sports stars condemned the former hero, saying his actions – in both taking drugs and then denying it for so many years – had damaged the image of sports far beyond cycling. \"I guess all I needed to see was the first few minutes [of the interview] and then I knew what was the deal, and the rest I don't really care,\" tennis player Roger Federer told reporters at the Australian Open. \"I'm an active athlete right now, and it's not fun times really to be in sports to a degree.\"</p><p>Anti-doping officials were equally unimpressed. If Armstrong's aim was to reduce his ban, then it appears to have failed. \"He spoke to a talk-show host. I don't think any of it amounted to assistance to the anti-doping community, let alone substantial assistance. You bundle it all up and say, 'So what?',\" said David Howman, the director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency, in an interview with the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><p>On Friday night, Armstrong appeared more emotional in his talk with Winfrey than in the first interview. Winfrey is renowned for being a virtual therapist to the public ordeals of disgraced celebrities, often bringing them to tears. Armstrong, who throughout last week had appeared unnervingly controlled, did not shed a tear but he did appear to choke up. \"I saw my son defending me and saying, \"That's not true. What you're saying about my dad is not true. That's when I knew I had to tell him,\" Armstrong said. The cyclist paused, lip trembling, and looked away as he composed himself.</p><p>But aside from that moment the rest of the interview went largely as expected, with Armstrong confessing to his sins – though by no means agreeing to all the accusations levelled against him – and showing perhaps unwise flashes of defiance and self-regard.</p><p>He told Winfrey he was desperate to compete again, effectively admitting he was not coming clean out of guilt but because he cannot tolerate life outside of sports. \"If you're asking me, do I want to compete again ... the answer is, hell, yes. I'm a competitor. It's what I've done my whole life. I love to train. I love to race,\" he said. He even said he deserved a second chance, perhaps breaking the cardinal rule of such TV confessions, which is to remain entirely contrite.</p><p>\"Frankly, this may not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it,\" he told Winfrey.</p><p>In choosing Winfrey, Armstrong dodged the news media that had been accusing him for years, trading Winfrey's softball questions and avoiding an interrogator who would have grilled him properly. Yet even in those circumstances Armstrong seemed to fail to come entirely clean. He did not reveal why he chose to take the doping route, how he did it and who helped him do it and cover it up for so long. He denied trying to buy influence with the anti-doping body USADA with an offer of a donation of millions of dollars. He said he had stayed clean of drugs in his 2009 attempted comeback, something that runs counter to a damning USADA report that catalogued all the accusations against him.</p><p>Winfrey asked Armstrong if he might \"rise again\" in public life to reclaim some of his once golden boy reputation as the cancer-beating super athlete. \"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's out there,\" Armstrong replied. Whatever it is, it's almost certainly not good.</p><h2>Armstrong's errors</h2><p><strong>Didn't cry properly</strong></p><p>When high-profile guests appear on Oprah Winfrey's show, they are expected to weep copiously as they reveal all. Someone as competitive as Armstrong knows that second place counts for nothing: his choking up and near-tears just did not cut it. America wanted rivers of tears.</p><p></p><p><strong>Didn't give a full confession</strong></p><p>The only way to do a confession is to go all the way. Armstrong appeared to want to go only so far. He needed to name names and give full and frank details. But Armstrong seemed happy with generalities and still denies key allegations.</p><p><strong>Didn't lose the 'attitude'</strong></p><p>During the hours of interview, many commentators remarked on Armstrong's controlled and emotionless demeanour. Armstrong needed to show he was human and worthy of sympathy and – most importantly of all – genuine. His performance came across as just that: something fake for the camera.</p><p></p><p><strong>Played the victim</strong></p><p>Armstrong seemed to break another cardinal rule of such confessions in having too much self-pity. At one point, he felt that he \"deserved\" a chance of a comeback. He had failed to understand that in the world of TV confessions that is not up to you any more.</p>","headline":"Lance Armstrong faces multi-million dollar legal challenges after confession","trailText":"Disgraced cyclist's Oprah interview fails to impress public and anti-doping officials – and court cases are mounting","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2013/1/19/1358613352439/Lance-Armstrong-003.jpg","wordcount":"1192","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-26T23:55:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/19/lance-armstrong-legal-challenges-confession","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jan/19/lance-armstrong-legal-challenges-confession","tags":[{"id":"sport/lance-armstrong","webTitle":"Lance Armstrong","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/lance-armstrong","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","webTitle":"Oprah Winfrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","references":[]},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/drugs-in-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/uknews","webTitle":"News","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paulharris","webTitle":"Paul Harris","rcsId":"GNL004733","r2ContributorId":"16239","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/24/1359029262500/Paul-web.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Harris is a US correspondent for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\">Guardian</a> and Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulharris","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/paulharris","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-402688597","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2013/1/19/1358613349833/Lance-Armstrong-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Mandel Ngan","altText":"Lance Armstrong","height":"54","credit":"Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"A man watches Lance Armstrong being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey.

But questions remained over allegations of bribery and cover-up, and whether he doped in his 2009-10 comeback.</p><p>The second, hour-long interview, which aired on Friday night on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) completed a dramatic confession whose first segment aired a night earlier, delivering a huge scoop to the struggling network.</p><p>Armstrong, 41, repeated his contrition, addressing the millions of supporters who had believed his years of denials about using performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids and EPO. \"I'd say I understand your anger, your sense of betrayal. You supported me forever through all of this ... and I lied to you. And I'm sorry. I will spend – and I'm committed to spending – as long as I have to to make amends.\"</p><p>Asked if he owed an apology to David Walsh, the Sunday Times journalist who doggedly pursued the story despite intimidation and threats from Armstrong, he briefly hesitated, before saying: \"I'd apologise to David.\"</p><p>The Texan said his remorse was genuine, not an attempt to deflect damage. \"Everybody who gets caught is bummed out that they got caught. Do I have remorse? Absolutely. Will it grow? Absolutely. For me these are the first steps. These are my actions. I'm paying the price but I deserve it.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/18/lance-armstrong-oprah-winfrey\">In the first interview on Thursda</a>y, Winfrey extracted a frank confession from Amstrong, who admitted  to having doped before his 1995 battle with cancer  and during his sevens straight Tour de France wins between 1999 and 2005. Critics said she failed to demand sufficient detail and expressed scepticism over Armstrong's continued denials about allegedly paying the International Cycling Union (UCI) and a Swiss laboratory to bury positive dope tests. Many also doubted his claim to have competed cleanly during a 2009-10 comeback.</p><p>Winfrey did not press those issues in the second interview segment and instead focused on Armstrong's relationship with his family, his sponsors and his inner turmoil.</p><p>He described his decision to sever ties with his cancer foundation Livestrong last November, after a Usada report exposed his cheating and made his position untenable, as humbling. \"The story was getting out of control, it was my worst nightmare ... the foundation is like my sixth child.. and to make that decision, and to step aside, that was big. It was the best thing for the organisation but it hurt like hell.\"</p><p>Showed a clip of a defiant Armstrong denying doping during a 2005 deposition, he winced. \"It's sick. I don't like that guy. That is a guy who felt invincible ... that guy is still there, I'm not going to lie to you and the public and say oh I'm in therapy, he's gone.\"</p><p>He admitted to being narcissistic and said if one of his children behaved like he did in the tape he would be \"apoplectic\".</p><p>Armstrong said he wished to compete again, if not in cycling then running, such as the Chicago marathon or Austin 10K. Winfrey appeared incredulous he wished to be allowed to compete again. He said: \"This may not be the most popular answer right now ... but I think I deserve it.\"</p><p>Asked if he had got what he deserved, in terms of comeuppance, he replied: \"I deserve to be punished. I'm not sure I deserve the death penalty,\" referring to his complete ban from sporting events.</p><p>Armstrong said an infamous tweet, showing him lying at home amid his framed Tour de France yellow jerseys just after being banned, was an act of defiance. \"And you know what's scary I actually thought it was a good idea at the time.\"</p><p>He said the destruction of his legend had changed how he viewed himself. \"This is heavy, this is messy.\" He said he was undergoing therapy. \"I've had a messy life, this is going to be a long process ... There is not going to be one tectonic shift here.\"</p><p>Armstrong said he made a comeback in 2009 after promising his then-wife, Kristin, to compete cleanly. \"I gave her my word and I stuck to it.\" He said he expected to win the Tour de France that year because improved drug testing had cleaned up the sport and levelled the playing field. He came third.</p><p>Armstrong's flinty demeanour cracked when he recounted how his 13-year-old son Luke had defended him against the taunts of other children. Groping for words, he said: \"It almost goes ... he can't. That's when I knew I had to tell him. And he'd never asked me. He'd never said, Dad is this true. He'd trusted me.\"</p><p>He confessed to his son and twin daughters, aged 11. \"I said, 'listen there's been a lot of questions about your Dad's career ... I want you to know that it's true'. They didn't say much. Didn't say, but wait, Dad. They just accepted it.\"</p><p>The face raw, the voice quavering, he told Winfrey: \"I said, Luke, don't defend me anymore.\" His son, he said, responded well. \"He just said, I love you, you're my Dad, this won't change that. Thank god he's more like Kris than he is like me.\" His downfall had made his mother a \"wreck\".</p><p>Armstrong said he \"selfishly\" hoped the TV confessional would prompt the anti-doping agency Usada to lift its ban but his main motive was his children, including the two youngest, toddlers. \"They have no idea [about the scandal] but they will learn it. This conversation will live forever. That dumb tweet with the yellow jerseys will live forever.\"</p><p>In a rare investigative foray, Winfrey asked about a claim that Armstrong tried to pay off Usada with a donation. \"No. That's not true.\"</p><p>Losing sponsors was financially devastating, he said. \"I've lost all future income.
