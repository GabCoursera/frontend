Maybe it was because the broadcast didn't start until after the watershed, so we'd expected more bite. But Stephen Fry calling Emma Thompson \"a ghastly piece of stinking offal\" and describing Captain Phillips as \"Saving Mr Hanks\" didn't quite seem to cut it like it might have in 2002. There was the odd glimmer of the old wit: slagging off Jeff Pope's grammar, telling us he was so moved by Oprah in The Butler he nearly gave his the afternoon off. But Fry's own suggestion that Steve Coogan should take on the mantle seemed the sanest thing he said all night. </p><h2>Gravity isn't <em>that</em> good, and people aren't really buying it as British</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946705'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/11/6/1383752856977/GRAVITY-009.jpg' alt='GRAVITY' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />Most people loved Gravity. But most people also have limits. It wasn't <em>that</em> good, was it? And if it <em>was</em> that good, why did it not win best picture? Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/14/baftas-gravity-british-film\">the practicalities of why it's apparently a British production are well-documented</a> (and the shout-outs to Framestore were great), to hear it officially minted as such does stick in the throat a bit. Still: it's reassuringly inclusive, in a way, that the borders of Britishness now extend to outer space. </p><h2>Slave has definitely lost momentum</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946706'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389200359025/12-Years-A-Slave-008.jpg' alt='12 Years A Slave' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />There seemed<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/12-years-a-slave-toronto-film-festival-people-s-choice-winner\"> no way, back in September, that it seemed 12 Years a Slave wouldn't dominate the Oscars</a>, taking at least best picture and director, probably script, actor, supporting actor and supporting actress and everything else with it. But if it can't sweep the board here, it surely can't do it anywhere. The only hope is that the US will embrace it as one of their own (it being, after all, technically American).  </p><h2>James Gandolfini was snubbed. Likewise Richard Griffiths</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946707'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/15/1381827293308/James-Gandolfini-and-Juli-010.jpg' alt='James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in Enough Said' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />The sad late run on spaces to be filled in the In Memoriam section could not fully explain the exclusion of these two, one of whom actually starred in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156988/enough-said\">an awards contender </a>this year. It would have been politic to namecheck Roger Lloyd Pack and Mel Smith, too. </p><h2>There is now a Jennifer Lawrence backlash</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946708'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392598667308/Lupita-Nyongo-007.jpg' alt='Lupita Nyong'o' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Andrew Cowie/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>We never thought we'd live to see the day people went off Jennifer Lawrence, but our collective crush has claimed its first casualty: Lupita Nyong'o, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianfilm/status/435171227674488832/photo/1\">officially robbed</a> for best supporting actress. Had Lawrence attended, perhaps the potential damage might have been mitigated. But, for the first time in recorded history, anti-J-Law mutterings were recorded. </p><h2>Not all surprises are bad</h2><p><br />Partly it's because Jared Leto wasn't even nominated (likewise Matthew McConaughey for best actor), but Barkhad Abdi's beating the likes of Michael Fassbender and Matt Damon was one of the better moments of the show. Less because he definitely turned in the superior performance than those two than just for the faint underdog shock. Ditto <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV5_Ak07QO4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Will Poulter</a>; it's testimony to his cuteness that - unlike with the supporting actress prize - you didn't feel too bad for Nyong'o.</p><h2>Foreign language documentaries: ok. Foreign language fiction: not so much</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946709'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/9/5/1378389065134/the-great-beauty-toni-ser-010.jpg' alt='the-great-beauty-toni-servillo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing was a worthy best documentary winner; it was also cheeringly nominated for best foreign language film, where it joined the likes of The Great Beauty (which won) and Blue is the Warmest Colour. Shame, then, that the likes of Toni Servillo and Adèle Exarchopoulos, Paolo Sorrentino and Abdellatif Kechiche weren't deemed worthy contenders in the best actor, actress and director categories. (It also explains some of the thinking behind the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-film-awards/forget-baftas\">Guardian Film Awards</a>.)</p><h2>We're sure she's not <em>actually</em> alcoholic, and we do still find it funny and everything, but we are sort of wondering when Emma Thompson will stop doing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jan/13/golden-globes-2014-emma-thompson-barefoot-video\">her boozy routine</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946710'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392599199400/Emma-Thompson-009.jpg' alt='Emma Thompson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/REX</figcaption></figure><p>Again: it's great. It's just that at some point it might just get a bit too convincing - she is a pretty good actor, after all.</p><h2>No-one can take that best actress Oscar from Cate Blanchett</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946704'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392600300697/Cate-Blanchett-009.jpg' alt='Cate Blanchett' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cate Blanchett … got game.

And we were on Dame Judi's home turf. But Blanchett still won the best actress Bafta. She also aced her speech: decrying celebrity, dedicating it to Philip Seymour Hoffman, and pretending she was unfit. This is now what's called an Oscars lock. </p><h2>Helen Mirren: trooper</h2><p>For someone not yet 70, Helen Mirren has racked up a fair shelf of lifetime achievement awards. She didn't <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96MRTUuogek\">twerk</a> this time, nor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/02/european-film-awards-haneke-amour\">declare herself a \"fucking whore\" and proud of it</a>, but she still classed up last night's ceremony by asking the audience to thank their teachers then quoting what felt like the whole of the Tempest, but actually only this:  </p><blockquote><p>Be cheerful, sir.<br />Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<br />As I foretold you, were all spirits and<br />Are melted into air, into thin air.<br />And like the baseless fabric of this vision,<br />The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br />The solemn temples, the great globe itself – <br />Yea, all which it inherit – shall dissolve,<br />And like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br />Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<br />As dreams are made on, and our little life<br />Is rounded with a sleep.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/12-years-a-slave-baftas-2014\">• Peter Bradshaw's take</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-what-did-you-think\">• What did you think?</a></p>","headline":"Baftas 2014: 10 things we learned","trailText":"<p>The red carpet has been rolled, the stars are sleeping off their hangovers.

There she is – behind the bunting and the open wicker chest of haberdashery. You can see her if you wrench your eyes away from the 3D birdcage art, floral rug and heavily ornamented bookshelf. \"It's a bit grandiose to call it a study. Not much studying goes on in here,\" she says. There is a desk, though, which belonged to her paternal grandmother – \"a source of enormous pleasure to me\", she says. \"It is exactly the same one as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8366026/The-first-pictures-from-the-set-of-Downton-Abbey.html\" title=\"Click through the gallery to picture number three\">Lord Grantham</a> sits at in Downton Abbey.\"</p><p>The books seem a puzzle, though. They are stacked strangely, with the spines hidden. Surely that's no way to choose your next read? \"Can you see a 'K' in them?\" says Allsopp. Now she mentions it, yes: the righthand pillar bends in and out. She is very fond of her initials. \"There are definitely quite a lot of Ks hanging around my house,\" she says. \"I would have KMA on absolutely everything.\" Witness the framed K on the dresser, the \"Kirstie\" mug, the cutout of Kirstie's face. \"It's a bit showy. You shouldn't really.\" Luckily, Allsopp, who lives with her partner and their four boys, says she is the only initial-botherer in the house. And anyway, this room is very much <em>her</em> room.</p><p>She hoped for a boudoir feel, the female equivalent of study-as-retreat, perhaps for an after-dinner cigar. \"I have been to homes where the lady of the house has a sitting room. That is what it was supposed to be,\" she says. In practice, the study has never delivered on that idea. It \"may as well be called the distribution centre\". Parcels come and go. Things for the show; online shopping; new looks tested out. Nothing about the rest of the house should be inferred from Allsopp's study, which she describes as a uniquely \"feminine and old-fashioned\" room. \"I live in an incredibly masculine-looking home. A man's dream home. He buys the furniture and dictates the look of it.\" He being Ben Andersen, a property developer whose parents own an <a href=\"http://www.lacquerchest.com\" title=\"\">antiques shop</a> on London's Kensington Church Street. So what does Allsopp get to dictate? \"I'm allowed to work on Operation Valance – the cushions, soft furnishings.\"</p><p>This seems surprising. It is tricky to match the forthright Allsopp of Location Location Location, always charging into properties and picking out some poor wall for demolition, to the pompom-, haberdashery-loving craftswoman content to select cushions. Suddenly she sounds brisk again. \"I do walk into places and think, 'Oh my God, this needs a cornice, or this door frame is the wrong size.' And all of that is in my DNA,\" she says. \"The golden rules for layout are absolutely to work out the use of each&nbsp;space.\"</p><p>• Kirstie Allsopp's Best of Both Worlds, Tuesday 25 February, 8pm on Channel 4</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429919574'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/14/1392399599187/Charlie-Luxton-sitting-on-001.jpg' alt='Charlie Luxton sitting on his kitchen table' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'It all goes on here. Homework, eating, sat on the laptop checking stuff out' … Charlie Luxton on his kitchen table. Photograph: John Robertson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><h2>Charlie Luxton<br /></h2><p>It all goes on here, <a href=\"http://www.charlieluxton.com/Charlie_Luxton/home.html\" title=\"\">Charlie Luxton</a> says. He rests his hands on the kitchen table. \"Homework, eating, sat on the laptop, checking stuff out.\" The kitchen table stands out simply because it is one of few pieces of furniture in the house. Indeed, according to Luxton, the furniture here is best seen as \"objects in space rather than the things you need to make a space function\". Aside from beds, two sofas, one lounge chair, a 17th-century chest that was a gift from his parents, and – that essential of every comfortable home, a pig slaughter bench – there is very little that is free-standing. \"We don't have the space,\" he says.</p><p>What they (he, his wife Kate and their two children) have is a small, white, thatched cottage in the countryside near Banbury, Oxfordshire. The preference for a built-in aesthetic is evident in every room. One kitchen cupboard dug out of a nook is barely three inches deep, but still stuffed full. \"Wherever there's a niche you've got to inhabit it,\" he says. The children's beds are built in. A built-in sofa is planned for the snug.</p><p>Despite his insistence that this is a small house, it feels spacious. The Scottish elm staircase dog-legs to a large square landing, lined with books. The two bedroooms come off this hall, which feels lavish. \"It's the circulation space that makes a house feel generous, not the rooms,\" he says.</p><p>Texture looms large. Antique Welsh blankets drape the sofas. Behind their bed, unfolded like a frieze, are punchcards from an automated weaving machine. It's all in the details here. What Luxton calls a \"dado line\", where a bottom section of wall has been gloss-painted to wipe clean, makes the merest interruption to neutral walls: you have to search for the seam between matt and shine. Do Luxton and Kate share the same taste? \"It takes months to come to a consensus,\" he says. \"Professionally, I design things for people. On one level, Kate is my client. So I try to give her what she wants.\" This sounds reasonable. Then he adds, ominously, \"Or needs.\"</p><p>Luxton's home has rainwater harvesting, a wood pellet boiler system, solar thermal panels, wood waste insulation. He wants a nice \"environment with a capital E\" and also with a \"small e\" – a nice place to live. He's got that. The kitchen shelves are busy with jars of pasta and unfancy teabags; children's lunchbags swing from a cupboard; and, at 11am on a weekday, there's a frying pan on the draining board. A sign of a good breakfast?</p><p>• Charlie Luxton presents Building The Dream, a new series coming soon to More4</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429919575'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/14/1392399822680/Sarah-Beeny-at-home-001.jpg' alt='Sarah Beeny at home' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'He could make that look just like someone if he wanted to' … Sarah Beeny on her husband's paintings. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><h2>Sarah Beeny<br /></h2><p>\"This is the room the children go in least,\" says Sarah Beeny. We are sitting at a round mahogany table in a small panelled reception, at the very outer edge of her London home. \"It remains fractionally more civilised than the rest of the house.\" The children's possessions wash at the shoreline between this room and the next: a hamster, back in its cage after an early morning escapade; a neighbouring cage with a plain grey mouse in it. It looks like the untamed sort you would rather not see in your house. \"The cat caught it,\" Beeny explains matter-of-factly. \"The children wanted to keep it. With four boys, you choose your battles.\" She rubs at the polished table top, and with her fingertip locates the word S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G penned into its surface. She isn't too cross. Beeny doesn't believe in treating things \"in too precious a way. I probably go a bit too far the wrong way.\" Too laidback? \"Probably.\"</p><p>We are sitting in this room because it is the one space that \"is as close to how we like to live as possible\". Small as it is, it feels grand. There are large ceramic lamps on side tables, original art on the walls, and all that panelling. \"We're both a bit obsessed with panelling,\" she says. \"We panelled the kitchen, we panelled here. In <a href=\"http://www.risehall.com\" title=\"\">Rise Hall</a> [the Yorkshire mansion she owns with her husband, <a href=\"http://www.graham-swift.com\" title=\"\">Graham Swift</a>], we panelled about 10 rooms. I think we are both mildly obsessed with stately homes. Given the choice we would have gilding everywhere and trompe l'oeil. Versailles does it for both of us.\" Except Beeny's panelling is MDF – something she reveals without embarrassment. She likes it because it is \"a cheat, cheapy way\" of adding interest.</p><p>Cheap is a theme. Beeny can point to any piece of furniture here and say what she paid for it. The ornate wooden mirror was £35. The enormous dresser was £60. She loves an auction. One of the old artworks was out of a skip. \"It's partly because we're tight,\" she says, and laughs. On and off-screen, Beeny is a bargain-hunter. If her taste is more decorative than I expected – even the radiator has swirls – she is also pragmatic. So what about these paintings on the walls, these haunting portraits of distorted faces? They feel as if they are coming from a different place. Beeny is keen to explain that her husband, the artist responsible, is perfectly capable of more figurative work. \"He could make that look just like someone if he wanted to, but I don't think he finds that inspiring. Can you imagine being able to do that and finding it boring? Mad!\"</p><p>Swift is a bit of an enigma too, mind you. He creates these paintings and is also happy designing MDF panelling. \"Being married to an artist is quite hard work, because they are quite complicated,\" says Beeny. \"People talk about struggling artists. They go in a very deep, dark place when they're painting. And then the result is so beautiful in comparison to how dark it was. I'm like, my God, why were you so cross all that time? He's like Jekyll and Hyde. He's massively shallow, then incredibly deep. I always think, 'what a shallow, facile man you are for someone so deep!'\"</p><p>If that sounds harsh, she is equally happy giving a personal evaluation. \"I'm pretty flippant myself.\"</p><p>• Sarah Beeny's new property website can&nbsp;be found at <a href=\"http://www.tepilo.com\">tepilo.com</a></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429919576'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/14/1392400020509/Martin-Roberts-in-his-kit-001.jpg' alt='Martin Roberts in his kitchen        ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'It was a drunken night with my best mate Dave, who's a cabinet maker' … Martin Roberts on his rocket units. Photograph: South West News Service</figcaption></figure><h2>Martin Roberts<br /></h2><p>He has an expectant look as we enter the kitchen, as if he is waiting for a reaction. That is because his units are in the shape of rockets. It's fine to laugh, as I do. <a href=\"http://www.martinroberts.co.uk\" title=\"\">Martin Roberts</a> takes laughter as a sign of approval.</p><p>\"It was a drunken night. Two bottles of red wine. With my best mate Dave who's a cabinet maker,\" he says. \"I wanted him to build my kitchen. And I thought, 'I don't want something you'd see anywhere else. Why not go for something a bit wacky?'\" So the wall cupboards are topped off with prismatic roofs and punched with walnut rivets. \"I've always loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDhmlMQT60\" title=\"\">Wallace and Gromit</a>, and I've always loved that kitchen in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, where things fold down,\" he says. \"It's mad inventor stroke Wallace and Gromit.\" Roberts has had the kitchen, at his home on the edge of Bath, for 10 years. \"It's just something that you don't see every day.\" He, of course, does see it every day, but he still smiles every time. \"I&nbsp;love it for that.\"</p><p>Roberts shares the house with his wife Kirsty and their two children, aged six and four. It is hard to imagine many spouses hearing his description of the kitchen and agreeing to it. How on earth did he pull that off? He looks puzzled. \"Olive and walnut, with granite work surfaces?\" What, you didn't mention the rockets? \"No rockets,\" he says. \"But it was all OK because she knows I have pretty good taste. The rest of the house is magnolia.\"</p><p>He's joking. The rest of the house is full of Roberts's possessions, which include what was once purportedly the \"main newsgathering camera for Angolan television\", an old-fashioned mincing machine and a driftwood dresser whose doors are washed-up keyboards. In the music room, he breaks into a bluesy interlude at the grand. His piano certificates – grades 1 and 3 – are on the wall, and there is a decorative dentist's mould on the mantelpiece. It is the cast of a mouth belonging to an unknown patient who, by the looks of things, was in need of four false teeth. Is that right? \"Correctamundo!\" he says.</p><p>I'm starting to feel a bit sorry for Kirsty, but Roberts cheerfully counters that she has a sewing room upstairs. And she is getting her own back by surreptitiously throwing out his stuff. He cites his favourite cactus, which has inexplicably disappeared.</p><p>How does he think other people would describe his taste? \"A mess! No.\" He's joking again. He has faith in his taste. \"Interesting. It's not boring, is it? The comment I usually get is, it's a lived-in house that is very you, and it's almost a scrapbook. It's a loved house. One with a warm welcome.\"</p><p>Back in the kitchen, one ornament seems to strike a different note to the rocket-shaped units: four little coloured cubes that spell out H-O-M-E. Who put those there? \"Kirsty,\" he says. Perhaps it's the start of a fightback.</p><p>• Martin Roberts presents Homes Under The Hammer on BBC1, weekdays at 10am</p><h2><strong>Insider view: what did they make of each other's places? </strong><br /></h2><p>We showed our hosts photographs of each other's homes and asked for their opinions – but didn't tell them who the homes belonged to</p><h2>Martin Roberts on Kirstie Allsopp</h2><p>\"I have to say it is my kind of room because it is so full of stuff. It is obviously somebody who is similar to me in that they have filled the room with memorabilia. A cat would cause chaos very quickly. It belongs to somebody who would actually fit in quite well in my house. They're having fun.\"</p><h2>Sarah Beeny on Charlie Luxton</h2><p>\"For me there isn't enough stuff in it. But this is how most people want to live now, because it's clean and simple. What a sweet little cottage.\"</p><h2>Kirstie Allsopp on Sarah Beeny </h2><p>\"The pair of lamps work well. Anything you can get in a pair is a great thing as this creates balance. The two paintings above the lamp, although not to my taste are good with their classical colours, but I'd probably do a triptych above there all a bit smaller. Or if I was to keep it I'd drop the centre picture a tiny bit lower. The unit is too full of knick-knacks and needs to be pared back and for me there is too much brown furniture/brown surfaces. The table needs to be broken up with some colour or a cloth or runner.\"</p><h2>Charlie Luxton on Martin Roberts</h2><p>\"Prog Rock reincarnated as a kitchen.

The Parrett overtopped its banks by Burrowbridge in January and the village was cut off.</p><p>A third scheme for the river, called \"Parrett Estuary – Cannington Bends\", worth £6.2m, covered an area near where it meets the sea, just a few miles from the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point.</p><p>The defences, which were to be part-funded by Hinkley-owner EDF Energy, would have moved 536 homes out of \"the very significant or significant flood probability category to the moderate or low category\", according to EA documents. In 2010, the agency said the <a href=\"http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Flood-defence-upgrade/story-12302473-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">defences \"urgently need updating\"</a> and the Cannington Bends area was heavily flooded in 2012, but the scheme has received no funding under the coalition and is currently in line for only £792,000 in 2016-17.</p><p>The missing schemes were identified by the Guardian by comparing the flood defence spending plans for 2010-11, the final year of the last government's budget and a high-water mark for flood defence spending, with the plans for subsequent years under the coalition.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429947871'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391780170788/6e4da611-db85-47f1-8a0c-5484020493b9-460x276.jpeg' alt='Royal Marines from 40 Commando help build a sandbag wall around a property in Moorland as they help with flood defences on the Somerset Levels near Bridgwater on February 7, 2014' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Royal Marines from 40 Commando build a sandbag wall in Moorland near Bridgwater on February 7. (Matt Cardy/Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>In an interview with the Guardian the under-fire chairman of the Environment Agency, Chris Smith, welcomes the prime minister's recent \"money is no object\" remark to cope with the fallout of the storms, but wonders whether it will apply beyond the immediate crisis.</p><p>\"I hope he will apply the same principle to the longer-term issues about improving our flood defences. One of the things that has worried me is whether flood defence is seen by the Treasury as a high enough priority,\" he says.</p><p>Lord Smith says there would have to be an annual £20m rise in the government's £600m flood defence budget, as well as any inflationary increase, just to maintain Britain's present level of protection.</p><p>Chris Huhne, the former energy and climate change secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/16/chris-smith-floods-environment-agency-interview\" title=\"\">claims in a Guardian article</a> that the chancellor, George Osborne, was the driving force behind the cuts in flood defence spending in 2010. The chancellor was then forced to increase flood defence spending last June because insurance companies were threatening to withdraw cover for 350,000 homes at risk, Huhne claims.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429947872'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/31/1391195030052/Yalding-in-Kent-prepares--011.jpg' alt='Yalding in Kent prepares for further flooding' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Flooding in Yalding, Kent, at the end of January. (Matthew Aslett/Corbis)</figcaption></figure><p>Other undelivered flood defence schemes now identified  include a project in Devon called the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/147932.aspx\" title=\"\">Dawlish&nbsp;Warren and Exmouth Beach Management Scheme</a>, the goal of which was \"to reduce tidal flood risk to nearly 3,000 properties and the main railway into the south-west\". It had been in line for £2.7m, but by March 2015 will have received only a third of that.</p><p>The village of Yalding in Kent began flooding on Christmas Eve, with people evacuated by boat and helicopter, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/27/david-cameron-heckled-flood-yalding-kent\" title=\"\">Cameron was heckled by angry locals</a> during a visit a few days later. It had been in line for £200,000 of flood protection funding between 2011 and 2013, but has received nothing and there is no current plan for spending in the area.</p><p>It has also been established that about £5m is being spent between 2011 and 2015 on the Levels to improve the condition of seven sites of special scientific interest where otters, birds and important plants live, as well as to provide more storage for floodwaters. In total, about 1,500 hectares of water-dependent habitat are being improved, thereby avoiding heavy fines under EU environmental directives.</p><p>Flood defence funding rose sharply under the last government, following the recommendations of the Pitt review into the catastrophic floods of 2007. Under the coalition, annual spending fell to at least £90m below 2010-11 levels until 2013-14. In July 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\" title=\"\">Guardian identified 294 flood defence schemes</a> across the whole of England that had been in line for funding but had not gone ahead.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which provides the funding for flood defences, said: \"We have spent £2.4bn on flood management and protection from coastal erosion over the past four years. We will continue to build defences where they are needed.\"</p><p>Lord Smith says: \"The agency works within clear government guidelines on where to spend the funding it is given to maximise the protection for people and property.\"</p><p>Lord Krebs, the government's <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/about/structure-and-governance/asc-members/\" title=\"\">lead independent adviser on adapting to the impacts of climate change</a>, said: \"Ministers are perfectly entitled to say 'look we just don't have enough money and we will have to accept a greater risk of flooding.' That is a political judgment which needs to be made.\"</p><p>But he said cutting flood defence spending was a false economy, as each scheme saved £8 in damage for every £1 spent: \"In the long term these measures pay for themselves.\"</p><p>Krebs warned that without a change of approach to improve flood protection in line with the rising risk from climate change, the current \"firefighting\" approach to the crisis would be the only one available. \"Up to now climate measures have been seen as a long-term issue and it is always difficult for governments to think about long-term issues,\" he said. \"But sometimes it takes a crisis like this to wake people up. Let's deal with the short-term emergency, but I would be very sad if this was all put back in the filing cabinet afterwards.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-429173746\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/07/ITNP_NF_FLOODS_SMITH_07_itndv-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/07/ITNP_NF_FLOODS_SMITH_07_itndv/ITNP_NF_FLOODS_SMITH_07_itndv.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/07/ITNP_NF_FLOODS_SMITH_07_itndv_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/07/ITNP_NF_FLOODS_SMITH_07_itndv_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/07//ITNP_NF_FLOODS_SMITH_07_itndv.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>In his interview, Smith accepts that the EA's response to the flooding has not been perfect. He says it should have pushed harder for the money to dredge the rivers on the Somerset Levels, and he should have visited the county earlier to show support. \"There was a whole rest of country to worry about. I was up on the Humber looking at the damage from the storm surge and elsewhere. But I probably should have gone to talk with people down there at an earlier stage.\"</p><p>Smith says more than 5 million people in Britain are at risk of flooding, and that the government has to recognise the dangers. \"Flooding knocks out businesses, it knocks out employment, it costs a huge amount to restore. This is something quite apart from the human distress. Government has to give flood defence a higher priority.\"</p><p>Small and medium-sized firms that have been flooded or suffered significant loss of trade will be able to apply for help from the new Business Support Scheme announced by the prime minister. A helpline is also being set up to provide advice.</p><p>Cameron said: \"The government is taking action across the board to deal with the clear-up and help hard-working people affected by the floods. Dealing with these floods will be a long haul, requiring a stepped-up national effort with the whole country pulling together. We will continue to help the people who need help and protect the communities that need protecting.\"</p><p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: \"It is vital that small businesses affected by the flooding get assistance as quickly as possible. We know the insurance companies are working to process claims as quickly as possible and we will inform local authorities of their allocations from the Business Support Scheme on Thursday to assist businesses with clean-up costs or help them to continue trading.\"</p><p>Large swaths of Britain remain on high alert, with severe flood warnings still in place along the Thames and in Somerset.</p><p>Forecasters predicted some respite this week as largely fine weather with lighter winds and less rain is expected for the next five days.</p>","headline":"Flood area defences put on

It would also be against the founding principles of the EU because Scotland would be effectively being punished for exercising its democratic right to self-determination\".</p><p>She conceded Scotland would not seek to change the terms of the existing relationship between the UK and the EU, and said it would not be possible for the EU to force Scotland against its will. She said the EU could not force a country into the eurozone against its will – pointing to Sweden as an example.</p><p>Similarly she argued Scotland could retain its opt-out from the Schengen border agreement, arguing that the EU is an expansionist institution and would not insist on a border or barrier between Scotland and England.</p><p>The issue of the rebate would remain unchanged, and its distribution a matter of agreement between England and Scotland after separation.</p><p>Sturgeon tried to sidestep the issue of whether the rest of the UK would have to be consulted in a referendum on whether an independent Scotland should remain part of a currency union with the rest of the UK, simply saying it would be in the best interest of the UK for that to happen.</p><p>Earlier a distinguished former judge of the European court of justice, Sir David Edward, said if Scotland voted for independence, there would be a period of separation between Scotland and the EU. \"During that period there is no entity called Scotland that can negotiate with the EU, so the UK would have to negotiate the terms on which the new Scotland at the moment of separation can be a member state or not be a member state.\"</p><p>He said it was arguable that at the moment of separation Scotland would fall out of the European Union with the extraordinary consequence that all its citizens were no longer members of the EU. In addition, thousands of commercial relationships would be under a different system of law.</p><p>He said it was grossly optimistic to suggest this negotiation could happen by March 2016, the timetable set out by the SNP.</p>","headline":"Scotland could join EU 18 months after independence vote, says Sturgeon","trailText":"<p>Deputy first minister says EU will not deny Scotland its right to membership as to do so would be 'enormously disruptive'</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mz4q","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392630878631/Publication-of-White-Pape-006.jpg","wordcount":"629","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/feb/17/scotland-independence-sturgeon-united-kingdom-eu","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/global/2014/feb/17/scotland-independence-sturgeon-united-kingdom-eu","tags":[{"id":"politics/scottish-independence","webTitle":"Scottish independence","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/scottish-independence","references":[]},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scotland","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrickwintour","webTitle":"Patrick Wintour","rcsId":"GNL004731","r2ContributorId":"16227","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/02/10/PatrickWintour140x140.gif","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Wintour is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics\">political</a> editor for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/patrickwintour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"world/european-commission","webTitle":"European commission","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/european-commission","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/nicola-sturgeon","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429961951","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392630871309/Publication-of-White-Pape-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Murdo MacLeod","photographer":"Murdo Macleod","altText":"Publication of White Paper on independence","height":"54","credit":"Murdo Macleod/Murdo MacLeod","caption":"First minister Alex Salmond and deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon.

The reason humanity was not more developed, he believed, was that floods or other natural disasters repeatedly set civilisation back to the beginning.</p><p>Today, humans are developing ever faster. Our knowledge is growing exponentially and, with it, our technology. But humans still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression has had definite advantages for survival, but when modern technology meets ancient aggression the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth is at risk.</p><p>Today in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a> we see modern technology in the form of bombs, chemicals and other weapons being used to further so-called intelligent political ends. But it does not feel intelligent to watch as more than 100,000 people are killed or while children are targeted. It feels downright stupid, and worse, to prevent humanitarian supplies from reaching clinics where, as <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a> will document in a forthcoming report, children are having limbs amputated for lack of basic facilities, and newborn babies are dying in incubators for lack of power.</p><p>What's happening in Syria is an abomination, one that the world is watching coldly from a distance. Where is our emotional intelligence, our sense of collective justice?</p><p>When I discuss intelligent life in the universe, I take this to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history appears not to have been calculated to aid the survival of the species. And while it is not clear that, unlike aggression, intelligence has any long-term survival value, our very human brand of intelligence denotes an ability to reason and plan for not only our own but also our collective futures.</p><p>We must work together to end this war and to protect the children of Syria. The international community has watched from the sidelines for three years as this conflict rages, engulfing all hope. As a father and grandfather I watch the suffering of Syria's children and must now say: no more.</p><p>I often wonder what we must look like to other beings watching from deep space. As we look out at the universe, we are looking back in time, because light leaving distant objects reaches us much, much later. What does the light emitting from Earth today show? When people see our past, will we be proud of what they are shown – how we, as brothers, treat each other? How we allow our brothers to treat our children?</p><p>We now know that Aristotle was wrong: the universe has not existed for ever. It began about 14bn years ago. But he was right that great disasters represent major steps backward for civilisation. The war in Syria may not represent the end of humanity, but every injustice committed is a chip in the facade of what holds us together. The universal principle of justice may not be rooted in physics but it is no less fundamental to our existence. For without it, before long, human beings will surely cease to exist.</p><p>• A version of this article appeared in the Washington Post</p>","headline":"What's happening in Syria is an abomination","trailText":"<strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> We must use our human intelligence to end this war.

But, to Rodgers' bitter disappointment, Webb deemed Oxlade-Chamberlain's clumsy-looking challenge to have been fair.</p><p>\"You can't change it but I'll speak to an assessor or someone because it would be nice to know why it wasn't given,\" said Rodgers, who wondered whether the fact that the incident happened so soon after the first penalty played a part in Webb's decision.</p><p>\"For the first one Luis was clipped and the second one was even clearer. Howard was in a great position. I'm not sure whether it was because it was so quickly after the first one. It looks a blatant penalty, so we're bitterly disappointed to have not got that because that would have kept our momentum going for the final stages, when we were on top.\"</p><p>Suárez has been accused of simulating fouls in the past but Rodgers believes that his striker is unjustly maligned and opponents regularly get away with illegally stopping him. He cited an unpunished foul in the box by Samuel Eto'o on the Uruguayan during Liverpool's Premier League defeat at Stamford Bridge as another example. \"We're a team that is really aggressive in our attacking and we provoke a lot of challenges,\" he said. \"Especialy Luis, who is always in and around the box and asking questions of defenders. Quite a lot of the time he doesn't get what he deserves. The one at Chelsea was a clear penalty. If it is a penalty it should happen, irrespective of what reputation he's got. I thought that was quite an easy decision to make [against Arsenal].\"</p><p>Arsène Wenger, however, was not convinced. The Frenchman, who famously attempted to sign Suárez last summer, suggested the striker may have been guilty of exaggerating.</p><p>\"Honestly, you know I rate Suárez as a player but, if we had him in our team, we would have a few more free-kicks,\" he said. \"It's always difficult to know with him if it is really genuinely contact. It was contact, I do not deny. But he is very good at making more of it every time.\"</p><p>Webb was also criticised by Arsenal fans for not sending off Gerrard after the midfielder, who had already been booked, chopped down Oxlade-Chamberlain near the Liverpool corner flag late in the match. Rodgers felt the referee was right that time. \"Of course it wasn't,\" he replied when asked whether he thought Gerrard's tackle deserved a second booking.</p><p>He then laughed knowingly, aware that would draw allegations of hypocrisy, before explaining: \"Nowadays with every challenge everyone talks about it having to be a yellow card. It was a foul but I'm not so sure it was worth a yellow. Howard's used his common sense because the player [Oxlade-Chamberlain] was going nowhere.\"</p><p>Rodgers was pleased with his team's \"outstanding\" performance, noting with some justification that Liverpool could have scored \"five or six more goals\" but ultimately Arsenal's superior finishing  saw the north London club through to the next round, where they will face Everton at the Emirates Stadium.</p><p>Wenger described the victory as a perfect response to the 5-1 humbling that his team suffered against the same opponents at Anfield last week and the ideal preparation for Wednesday's Champions League showdown with Bayern Munich. \"It was vital to respond to the disappointing performance at Liverpool last week,\" he said. \"I'm very pleased with the intensity, commitment and determination. You could feel a clinical desire in my team to take every opportunity.\"</p>","headline":"Brendan Rodgers fumes over 'blatant' penalty after Liverpool's FA Cup exit","trailText":"<p>Brendan Rodgers will demand an explanation from the referee Howard Webb after Liverpool lost 2-1 to Arsenal in their FA Cup fifth-round tie at Emirates Stadium</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mzxa","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392594878934/Howard-Webb-looks-on-as-A-006.jpg","wordcount":"640","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-arsenal-fa-cup","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/feb/16/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-arsenal-fa-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/liverpool","webTitle":"Liverpool","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/liverpool","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"}]},{"id":"football/arsenal","webTitle":"Arsenal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/arsenal","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"}]},{"id":"football/brendan-rodgers","webTitle":"Brendan Rodgers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/brendan-rodgers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/brendan-rodgers","references":[]},{"id":"football/fa-cup","webTitle":"FA Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/fa-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/300"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/pauldoyle","webTitle":"Paul Doyle","rcsId":"GNL034658","r2ContributorId":"16231","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Doyle is the  <br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">chief football writer for guardian.co.uk</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pauldoyle","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/pauldoyle","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/300"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/1006"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429961662","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392594878934/Howard-Webb-looks-on-as-A-006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Tom Jenkins","photographer":"Tom Jenkins","altText":"Howard Webb looks on as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain appears to knock over Luis Suárez","height":"84","credit":"Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins","caption":"Howard Webb looks on as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain appears to knock over Luis Suárez in the Arsenal penalty area.

That is maybe his opinion but of course I started late because I was injured so many times. What is important is that I was calm. I know my own value, and know I will play very well, and score more goals,\" came Jovetic's response.</p><p>The Montenegrin has become too familiar with the club's medical staff in this debut season following a £22m move from Fiorentina in the summer. Yet as his reply to Mourinho indicates, self-confidence remains intact and a glance at his disrupted campaign shows there have still been four goals in 11 City appearances (plus two more for Montenegro). These are hardly shabby numbers and with Jovetic accustomed to playing in any of the forward positions the 24-year-old may yet prove invaluable to City and illustrate his quality in the final third of the season. <strong>Jamie Jackson </strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/15/manchester-city-chelsea-fa-cup\" title=\"\">Match report: Manchester City 2-0 Chelsea</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/15/manchester-city-pellegrini-chelsea-fa-cup-mourinho\" title=\"\">Paul Wilson: Pellegrini stalls Chelsea momentum</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/jose-mourinho-manchester-city-chelsea-fa-cup\" title=\"\">Mourinho admits City were the better team</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/manchester-city-barcelona-chelsea-champions-league\" title=\"\">• Pellegrini: City are ready for Barça</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/jesus-navas-manchester-city-barcelona-champions-league\" title=\"\">• Navas: Messi won't be happy coming to City</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/barcelona-pedro-champions-league-manchester-city\" title=\"\">• Big interview: Sid Lowe talks to Barcelona's Pedro</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>2) Webb must up his game for Brazil</h2><p>It was a good night for World Cup-bound Englishmen at the Emirates. Well, for some of them anyway. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain confirmed his recent progress, scoring one and making one and producing a performance of speed, intelligence and a very English kind of all-action vim. Raheem Sterling was again impressive and Steven Gerrard dominant in the second half in his withdrawn midfield role. Carl Jenkinson, always good when he's facing forwards, less so when asked to turn and defend the space behind him, had a good game at right back for Arsenal. Daniel Sturridge didn't score but radiated a well-seasoned menace.</p><p>And then, of course, there was Howard Webb, who will also be in Brazil, who has endured a difficult start to the year, and who was again decisively below par. Webb should have given Liverpool a game-changing second penalty after Oxlade-Chamberlain had barged Luis Suárez to the ground in the second half. He should have given Steven Gerrard a second yellow card. He allowed a horrible challenge by Lukas Podolski to stand unpunished. And he generally refereed the match with the familiar sense of strutting, celebrified conviction that is just about bearable when he gets the majority of his decisions right, but which can grate horribly when he's off his game.</p><p>There were some misguided calls after the game for referees to appear in public to explain their decisions at the final whistle. In practice it is hard to imagine anything more grisly. Referees, who should be half-seen and certainly not heard, have for some time seemed confused enough over the exact extent and reach of their role, apparently elevated in their own minds to something only marginally beneath the players themselves. An out-of-form Englishman in a World Cup year is an all-too familiar story. Webb needs to up his game, soft-pedal a little his relentlessly insistent on-field persona, and simply get a few more of the big decisions right. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p><p><blockquote><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-arsenal-fa-cup\" title=\"\">• Rodgers fumes over 'blatant' penalty</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/arsenal-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Arsenal 2-1 Liverpool</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/16/arsenal-liverpool-fa-cup-fifth-round\" title=\"\">• Barney Ronay: Arsenal find the way to revenge</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/liverpool-steven-gerrard-holding-role-arsenal\" title=\"\">• Michael Cox: Gerrard can thrive in holding role</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/16/arsenal-liverpool-fa-cup-talking-points\" title=\"\">• Paul Doyle: five talking points from the Emirates</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2014/feb/16/fa-cup-arsenal\" title=\"\">• Tom Jenkins's best images from the Emirates</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/arsene-wenger-jose-mourinho-silly-disrespectful\" title=\"\">• Wenger brands Mourinho as 'silly and disrespectful'</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>3) Four won't go into three and certainly won't fit into two</h2><p>We are talking Sunderland's central midfield. Gus Poyet has his problems on Wearside – after all his team are in the Premier League's bottom three as well as the Capital One Cup final and the FA Cup quarter finals – but right now he possesses an embarrassment of riches in the heart of midfield.</p><p>With Liam Bridcutt, the manager's favourite holding midfielder, Lee Cattermole – excellent against Southampton when Bridcutt was rested – Jack Colback and Ki Sung-yueng all in sparkling form, which trio should play in the engine room of his hallmark 4-1-4-1 formation?</p><p>And what if Poyet opts to repeat his successful experiment with 4-1-3-2 that worked pretty well against Southmampton? Which two out of Bridcutt, Cattermole, Colback and Ki would he then drop? Oh and let's not forget that Craig Gardner, yet another Sunderland central midfielder, shone on Saturday not only scoring the winner but persistently getting behind Maurcio Pochettino's defence after making dangerous late runs from deep. While Gardner's touch is less than velvet his shooting from distance tends to be unerring. For Poyet it seems very much a case of dilemmas, dilemmas. If only he had a quartet – or even quintet – of prolific strikers to ponder. <strong>Louise Taylor </strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/15/sunderland-southampton-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Sunderland 1-0 Southampton </a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/15/sunderland-southampton-live-fa-cup-report\" title=\"\">Minute-by-minute report: look back on all the key events</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>4) If only Solskjaer was a few years younger</h2><p>The fact that Cardiff struggled to score against Championship opposition on Saturday is symptomatic of their season – 19 goals in 26 Premier League matches says it all. At the other end of the pitch only Fulham have conceded more than the 44 goals Cardiff have shipped. It is a dangerous combination and one which will see Cardiff relegated unless Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can find a remedy. While the sort of defensive mistakes that contributed to Wigan opening the scoring can be ironed out on the training ground, it is questionable how much Cardiff's manager can do about their goal threat. Fraizer Campbell, Cardiff's leading scorer with eight in all competitions, has never been prolific at the top level. Kenwyne Jones, signed from Stoke in January, is a one-in-four man. All of which means Cardiff need to rely on goals from other areas – a big ask when Jordan Mutch is their second highest Premier League scorer with four and Steven Caulker and Peter Whittingham are tied for third place with two each. Wilfried Zaha and Mats Daehli were brought in to inject some attacking flair but the worry for Cardiff is that they lack the potent goalscorer to make the most of their creativity. If only Solskjaer was a few years younger. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/15/cardiff-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Cardiff 1-2 Wigan</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>5) Harsh to condemn Monk for his team selection at Everton </h2><p>Making eight changes for a fifth-round FA Cup tie and losing 3-1 usually leaves a manager wide open to criticism of demeaning the oldest cup competition in the world. Those allegations were thrown at Swansea City's new manager Garry Monk at Everton. Given the home side's laboured first-half performance maybe an opportunity to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 1964, and defeat Everton for the first time in Swansea's history, was missed. But the visiting display was not undermined by the change in personnel, only by individual defensive errors that allowed Everton to ultimately ease into the quarter-finals. With Napoli to come and Premier League status paramount, Monk had to utilise his resources. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/everton-fa-cup-swansea-city-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Everton 3-1 Swansea</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>6) Wembley, and potential derby, rouse Sheffield</h2><p>If Sheffield Wednesday beat Charlton in their FA Cup fifth round tie, Sheffield will be guaranteed a club at Wembley in the semi-finals which, at long last, will provide this city with some success. Both traditionally top flight clubs, Sheffields Wednesday and United have both spent time in England's third tier, giving supporters of both clubs little to cheer. United's biggest game of the season attracted a crowd of 25,118, suggesting the magic of the Cup is very match alive in this part of the world. But there will not be a spare seat in the house at Bramall Lane if the dream Sheffield derby comes to fruition.<strong> Ian Baker</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/sheffield-united-nottingham-forest-fa-cup\" title=\"\">Match report: Sheffield United 3-1 Nottingham Forest</a></blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jason Cairnduff/Action, Adam Davy/PA, Lee Smith/Action, Stu Forster/Getty, Paul Thomas/Getty,</p>","headline":"FA Cup: talking points from the weekend's action","trailText":"<strong>Guardian writers:</strong> Stevan Jovetic comes out swinging, Howard Webb must up his game and Cardiff are craving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in his pomp","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mnpk","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392606513667/FA-Cup-talking-points-com-003.jpg","wordcount":"1313","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/17/fa-cup-talking-points-football","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/feb/17/fa-cup-talking-points-football","tags":[{"id":"football/fa-cup","webTitle":"FA Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/fa-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/300"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jamiejackson","webTitle":"Jamie Jackson","r2ContributorId":"19396","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/11/11/jamiejacks.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jamie Jackson is the Manchester football correspondent for the Guardian and Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jamiejackson","references":[]},{"id":"profile/louisetaylor","webTitle":"Louise Taylor","r2ContributorId":"22724","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/09/18/louisetaylor.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Louise Taylor is north-east football correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/louisetaylor","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/louisetaylor","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stuartjames","webTitle":"Stuart James","rcsId":"GNL014001","r2ContributorId":"16491","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/04/01/stuart_james_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Stuart James is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">football writer</a> who covers the midlands region for the Guardian.

They've become much more ideological, they've returned much more to a lot of their familiar theme tunes,\" he said. \"I think it would be best for everybody if the Conservative party were to rediscover a talent for actually talking to mainstream voters about mainstream concerns.\"</p><p>Clegg's words chime with a strategy of highlighting differences with the Tories as the election approaches. A source close to Clegg conceded that the language was stronger than his previous comments on the Tories, but insisted there was no fundamental change in the party's position. \"We still wish to sit between the two other parties and we are not picking one over the other,\" the source said.</p><p>Labour's position towards Clegg has appeared to change over recent months, from demanding Clegg's resignation as Lib Dem leader as part of any future coalition deal to paying him the occasional compliment.</p><p>In the aftermath of the 2010 election, senior Labour figures said Clegg's departure would be a precondition of any future Labour-Lib Dem coalition. Ed Miliband told the New Statesman: \"Given what he [Clegg] is supporting, I think it is pretty hard to go into coalition with him.\"</p><p>Ed Balls similarly suggested that there was little or no prospect of Labour working with Clegg, stating as recently as September 2012: \"Nick Clegg made his decisions and I think the way he's gone about his politics makes things very difficult [to form a coalition with him].\"</p><p>It has been thought that just as Clegg demanded Gordon Brown's head in 2010, so Labour would demand his if it won in 2015. But in January this year, Balls surprised many by saying he would be prepared to work with Clegg in 2015, and described him as a person of \"integrity\". Labour's abrasive shadow chancellor even claimed that the two of them had recently had a \"very friendly and warm chat\".</p><p>Balls comments prompted some Labour backbenchers to claim that Clegg's dismissal should remain a condition of any future coalition, not least because he remains the least popular of all three leaders, according to recent polls.</p><p>Sources close to Miliband dismissed Clegg's latest overtures as insignificant. \"Our view of the Lib Dems is clear. They have not acted as a brake on the Tories, but as a prop.\"</p><p>In the documentary, the former Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne is critical of Clegg's positioning and strategy going into the next election. Browne said: \"I have some unease that we are trying to pitch ourselves as a party that splits the difference between the other two … there's a sense of insipid centrism that is reassuringly unthreatening to people. That's not the same as liberalism.\"</p><p>Chris Huhne, the former energy secretary, criticises Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor, for their tactics during the referendum on electoral reform, which divided most Tories and Lib Dems. Huhne said: \"They went out and put out leaflets or sanctioned leaflets which were personally attacking Nick [Clegg] for going back on the tuition fees pledge, even though they had actually insisted on that as part of the coalition agreement and making the coalition work.\"</p><p>Shirley Williams, a former leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, criticises Clegg for surrounding himself with inexperienced advisers. \"I think he hasn't really sufficiently used effectively the experience and knowledge of some of the more senior members of the party … Nick surrounds himself with people his own age or considerably younger. He's got some good and some frighteningly bad as the case may be. And I think that that's unwise,\" she said.</p><p>But the former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said: \"He is, I think, the most gifted and able politician in British politics.\"</p><p>Clegg's words come after his party endured a dreadful week. The Lib Dems lost their deposit with less than 5% of the vote at the Wythenshawe byelection, and party donors Sudhir and Bhanu Choudhrie were arrested as part of a Serious Fraud Office corruption investigation focused on the manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The pair deny any wrongdoing.</p><p><em>Part two of Nick Clegg – the Liberal Who Came to Power, a two-part series on Radio 4, airs at 8pm  on Monday.</em></p>","headline":"Nick Clegg hints at possible coalition deal with Labour in 2015","trailText":"<p>Deputy PM praises Labour for embracing the possibility of sharing power and accuses Tories of becoming more ideological</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mnpx","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392575529326/Nick-Clegg-006.jpg","wordcount":"882","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/17/nick-clegg-hint-coalition-labour","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/feb/17/nick-clegg-hint-coalition-labour","tags":[{"id":"politics/nickclegg","webTitle":"Nick Clegg","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/nickclegg","references":[]},{"id":"politics/liberaldemocrats","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/liberaldemocrats","references":[]},{"id":"politics/liberal-conservative-coalition","webTitle":"Liberal-Conservative coalition","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rajeev-syal","webTitle":"Rajeev Syal","r2ContributorId":"29467","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rajeev Syal covers Whitehall and works on off-diary stories from the lobby for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rajeev-syal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/rajeev-syal","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/topstories","webTitle":"Top stories","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429946324","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392575522228/Nick-Clegg-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"David Jones","altText":"Nick Clegg","height":"54","credit":"David Jones/PA","caption":"Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister.

Bottom of the table were Greater Anglia and Southeastern, which run commuter services out of London, with the most satisfied customers travelling on Merseyrail, a self-contained network around Liverpool. The best scores for commuter trains went to National Express's C2C line, with Virgin topping the long-distance table, and beleaguered First Great Western rated the worst.</p><p>Eight in 10 passengers believed fares were too high, and one in five commuters said they had been forced to stand on their last journey. First Capital Connect and Greater Anglia rated lowest for cleanliness among commuters. More than one in 10 passengers said toilets were not in good working order. While only a quarter of passengers who felt they had cause to complain on their last journey had done so, those that had complained were mostly dissatisfied with the outcome.</p><p>The executive director of Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: \"It's disappointing to see some train companies consistently falling down on the basics of customer service, with dirty and overcrowded carriages and toilets that don't work.</p><p>\"Seven rail franchises end in the next two years and we want to see passengers' experiences put right at the heart of the tender process so companies respond to consumer expectations and can be held to account if they don't.\"</p><p>The Which? scores are markedly lower than the passenger satisfaction results collated by the watchdog Passenger Focus from a far bigger sample. However, Which? said its scoring system, based on overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend a company, used the same criteria it employed for other markets. Respondents were polled in early January, soon after the latest price rises.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429946905'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392568880425/Trainpassengersatisfaction.png' alt='Rail passenger satisfaction graph' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Rail Delivery Group said: \"As we acknowledged last month when the independent watchdog found that more than four out of five passengers were satisfied with their overall journey, the industry needs to build on the improvements it has delivered over the last 15 years.</p><p>\"We are always keen to get feedback from customers, whether good or bad, which has helped the industry attract record numbers of passengers and cut complaints by three quarters in a decade.\"</p><p>Bob Crow, leader of the RMT transport union, said the survey showed that Britain's privatised railways \"are delivering lousy service to the public while money that could be invested in capacity and upgrading is siphoned off into multi-million pound profits for the rich.</p><p>\"Boris Johnson should take note of the fact that the British people want ticket offices and properly-staffed stations which was the issue at the heart of the Tube dispute.\"</p><p>The rail minister, Stephen Hammond said: \"As well as getting passengers to their destinations, operators should be working hard to improve the overall experience of their customers.

But 12 Years a Slave unquestionably picked up the biggest prize, best film, with Chiwetel Ejiofor named as best actor.</p><p>In a year when no one film swept the board, American Hustle also came away with three prizes.</p><p>Alfonso Cuarón was named best director and said you would not know it from his accent but he considered himself a part of the British film industry. He has lived in London for 13 years and joked: \"I make a very good case for curbing immigration.\"</p><p>The film, with a Mexican director, American stars and an outer space setting, raised a few eyebrows when it was included in the best British film category. Nevertheless, it fulfilled the rules and duly won.</p><p>Gravity's haul was impressive, only one short of the seven Baftas won by The Artist in 2012 and The King's Speech in 2011. The record of nine, held by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was never in jeopardy.</p><p>Its British producer, David Heyman, said winning was \"beyond belief\" and paid tribute to the UK company behind the amazing special effects, Framestore, which brought applause from the audience. Those effects got their own award, best special visual effects, beating a shortlist that also included The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug, Iron Man 3, Pacific Rim and Star Trek Into Darkness.</p><p>The film also won for best sound, best cinematography and best original music, the latter by British composer Steven Price. He thanked his \"mum and dad for having such a great record collection when I was a kid\".</p><p>Accepting the best film award, 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen said: \"There are 21 million people in slavery now as we sit here. I just hope that 150 years from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film.\"</p><p>Ejiofor beat fellow shortlisted actors Bruce Dern, Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. He thanked McQueen for \"your work, artistry and passion in this project\". Addressing him he said: \"This is yours, I know that … you know that. I'm going to keep it, that's the kind of guy I am, but it's yours.\"</p><p>Ejiofor was visibly moved and a little nervous. Few people will be surprised if the London-born actor is not having to do it all again at next month's Oscars ceremony.</p><p>Cate Blanchett was named best actress for the Woody Allen film Blue Jasmine and she dedicated the award to the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. \"You raised the bar and all we can do in your absence is to continue raising it.\" She added: \"Phil, buddy, this is for you, you bastard, I hope you're proud.\"</p><p>Some of the evening's biggest cheers came as newcomer Barkhad Abdi was named best supporting actor for his portrayal of a Somali pirate in Captain Phillips.</p><p>He triumphed in an extremely strong category which included Michael Fassbender, Bradley Cooper, Matt Damon and Daniel Bruhl. Abdi thanked his co-star Tom Hanks and the director Paul Greengrass \"for believing in me before I believed in myself.\" Abdi was a limousine driver in Minneapolis, which has a large Somali community, when he turned up on a whim at an open audition and was cast.</p><p>Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby picked up two awards with Catherine Martin and Beverley Dunn winning best production design and Martin by herself winning best costume design. Martin thanked her team of 300 who worked on the film but, mercifully, not individually.</p><p>Rush, the dramatisation of Niki Lauda and James Hunt's Formula 1 rivalry, won the best editing award although the editors Dan Hanley and Mike Hill could not be there because director Ron Howard said they were busy editing his next movie. \"I think they'd thank the hell out of me,\" he joked.</p><p>American Hustle, David O Russell's 1970s grifting caper, won three awards. Jennifer Lawrence was named best supporting actress, and fittingly for a film with so many alarming haircuts and sideburns, it also triumphed in the best make-up and hair section. Its director, Russell, and Eric Warren Singer were the recipients of the best original screenplay award.</p><p>Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope were the surprise winners in the best adapted screenplay section, beating John Ridley who wrote 12 Years a Slave. Coogan said he was inspired to adapt the book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Martin Sixsmith, after he read an article in the Guardian four years ago. There were many thanks although Coogan said there were still another 60,000 women who had not traced their children, taken from them by nuns and put up for adoption, and \"their story isn't yet over\".</p><p>The sometimes controversial and always distinctive director Peter Greenaway, whose films include The Cook, The Thief, The Wife and Her Lover and The Pillow Book, received an outstanding British contribution to cinema award.</p><p>Greenaway, never shy in coming forward – in 2002 he accused film-makers of killing cinema with cynicism and laziness – follows in the footsteps of directors such as Ken Loach, Mike Leigh, Derek Jarman and Alan Parker. He said he was \"very, very surprised\" to get the award and regarded it as \"an encouragement for the continual reinvention of cinema\".</p><p>Dame Helen Mirren was given Bafta's highest accolade, a fellowship. Somewhat appropriately, since she has portrayed the real Queen on both film and stage, it was given to her by a member of the royal family in the shape of Prince William. Giving her the fellowship the prince joked: \"I should probably call her granny.\"</p><p>In her acceptance speech Mirren paid tribute to a teacher who inspired her and all teachers who inspire, asking people to applaud. She quoted from The Tempest: \"We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep,\" she said. \"My little life is rounded with this honour.\"</p><p>The only award voted on by the public, the EE Rising Star award, went to Will Poulter who first came to attention as Lee Carter in the 2007 film Son of Rambow and last year stood out in the comedy We're the Millers.</p><p>The film not in the English language award went to Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty.</p><p>The outstanding British debut award was presented by Steve Coogan to Kieran Evans, the writer and director of Kelly + Victor, a Liverpool-set love story.</p><p>Other winners included a harrowing film examining the Indonesian death-squads of the mid-sixties. The Act of Killing won in the documentary section and its director Joshua Oppenheimer used his speech to accuse Britain and the US of actively supporting the 1965 genocide in Indonesia and the regime which followed.</p><p>The best animated film went to Disney's Frozen, also one of the most successful. It has grossed nearly $1bn worldwide and beat Despicable Me 2 and Monsters University to the Bafta.</p><p>The winner in the best short film category was Room 8 and Sleeping with the Fishes won in the best short animation section.</p><p>The awards, a dry run for next month's Oscars, attracted many big Hollywood names including DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, and for the first time in years guests arrived on the red carpet under a fading blue sky.</p><p>The ceremony was once again amiably and wittily hosted by Stephen Fry who declared himself \"humbled, honoured and in the best sense of the word, paid to be here.\"</p><p>The evening went smoothly and there were was precious little gushing and rambling from award givers and recipients although there were a few grimaces at some of Fry's attempts to hurry things along.</p><p>\"Please don't kiss and dry hump everyone when you win,\" he said, \"just leap on the stage like a bloody gazelle.\"</p>","headline":"Baftas 2014: Gravity hits the heights but 12 Years a Slave takes best film","trailText":"<p>3D space disaster movie wins six awards at Royal Opera House, including best director and best British film</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mzve","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392587863379/Baftas--Gravity-006.jpg","wordcount":"1302","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/gravity-biggest-winner-bafta-awards-baftas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/feb/16/gravity-biggest-winner-bafta-awards-baftas","tags":[{"id":"film/baftas","webTitle":"Baftas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/baftas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/film/baftas","references":[]},{"id":"culture/awards-and-prizes","webTitle":"Awards and prizes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/awards-and-prizes","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/awards-and-prizes","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/baftas-2014","webTitle":"Baftas 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/baftas-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/film/baftas-2014","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markbrown","webTitle":"Mark Brown","rcsId":"GNL508770","r2ContributorId":"16054","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/mark_brown_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Mark Brown is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture\">arts</a> correspondent.

hoodies to goodies: today's teenagers have the makings of model citizens | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-16T19:30:00Z","sectionName":"Comment is free","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2014/feb/16/hoodies-goodies-teenagers-makings-good-citizens-young","fields":{"hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Good news, for those of you who had lost hope in modern society. According to a <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1376301.ece\" title=\"\">report by the thinktank Demos</a> today's teenagers – or youth, as certain newspapers prefer to dub them – far from being antisocial hoody-clad riot-mongers, are actually highly concerned with social issues, keen to volunteer, and take fewer drugs and drink less alcohol than previous generations. This had led to someone who clearly has no real-life experience of the teenage psyche labelling them \"Generation C\" (C for citizen). Cool.</p><p>Despite its cheesiness, Generation&nbsp;C makes a welcome change from the media moniker I once saw attached to my own contemporaries amid the pages of a rightwing paper – the \"F**k-it generation\" (their asterisks). Contrary to what the media might have you believe, teenagers aren't all about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/03/neknomination-facebook-binge-drinking-death-ireland\" title=\"\">neknomination</a>, dick pics and goading one another into suicide on Tumblr – some of them are actually quite nice. Even their teachers, in a study by Schoolzone, agreed that teenagers seemed more concerned about social issues. And yet 81% of teenagers felt they were negatively represented in the media and that this was having an adverse effect on their lives.</p><p>Their portrayal is probably, to some extent, the fault of my generation of millenials. When young journalists are given the opportunity to share their voices, it's either in the context of achingly edgy pieces about wanton misbehaviour, such as \"My first K-hole\" or \"All the people I've ever slept with have chlamydia\". That, or it's all very western problems (take recent internet sensation \"<a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/it-happened-to-me-there-are-no-black-people-in-my-yoga-classes-and-im-uncomfortable-with-it\" title=\"\">There are no black people in my yoga classes and I'm suddenly feeling uncomfortable with it</a>\"). In this BuzzFeed-driven journalistic climate, there's very little space for young people interested in writing about education and poverty issues in any depth; and yet, according to Demos, these are just the things that today's kids care about. It's time someone catered to them.</p><p>My first real political engagement came late, during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/nov/21/student-demo-2012-university-protesters\" title=\"\">2011-12 student protests</a>, and even then I was struck by how much more passionate the 14- to 16-year-olds who marched alongside us seemed to be. At the same age, all my friends and I were engaged with was trying to work out how to roll the biggest, most ostentatious joint possible without it collapsing in the middle. But their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/education-maintenance-allowance-ema\" title=\"\">education maintenance allowance</a> was to be taken away: no wonder they were angry. Now, it's looking as though this generation of young people will be the first to be poorer than their predecessors. And 84% of them say they are planning to vote. They are putting me to shame.</p><p>There is little more that we could ask for, in these times of austerity and inequality, than a new generation of politically engaged, socially minded young people. Without wanting to sound supremely patronising, whenever I visit schools to talk to students about sexism in the media I am struck dumb by how much they care. When I started blogging about these topics, I perhaps arrogantly thought that, much like many people in their mid-20s – my own age – teenagers would think that feminism had done its job and was no longer needed. And yet it turned out that many of them knew it all already, and were sitting there patiently waiting for others to pick up on it.</p><p>The same can be said of political engagement. Young people in this country are taught depressingly little about our political system and how it works – an alarmingly high number of people I meet seem to think we have proportional representation, for instance – and yet many of them care deeply about the policies this government is making and plan to participate in the next election. Those in power and those in opposition alike would do well to engage with them.</p><p>In the Sunday Times report of the Demos survey, a young lad who has set up his own social enterprise mentions a teenage girl who wants \"to give birthday cakes to people who don't get birthday cakes\". The sweetness of this gesture made my heart swell. People like her have had so much taken away from them and yet they still want to share a piece of the pie. If that doesn't give you hope then nothing will.<em> </em></p>","headline":"From hoodies to goodies: today's teenagers have the makings of model citizens","trailText":"<p><strong>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett:</strong> Contrary to the negative media portrayals, a new study shows young people are part of a caring-sharing generation</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mnn3","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392569019091/teenagers-studying-on-law-006.jpg","wordcount":"702","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/16/hoodies-goodies-teenagers-makings-good-citizens-young","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/16/hoodies-goodies-teenagers-makings-good-citizens-young","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"society/youngpeople","webTitle":"Young people","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/youngpeople","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rhiannon-lucy-cosslett","webTitle":"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","r2ContributorId":"50529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/25/1374749152108/Rhiannon-Lucy-Coslett.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett  is a London-based freelance writer.

Now the formerly homeless man has a choice of accommodation around the world after becoming one of Hungary's biggest lottery winners, with a prize of about £1.7m.</p><p>Andraschek, whose 630m Hungarian forint win last September went unnoticed until he made a significant donation to a hostel for the homeless this month, said buying the ticket was a chance decision at a railway station on his way to Budapest for a workshop for recovering alcoholics.</p><p>\"I had only picked six numbers and the female shop assistant reminded me that I needed to pick a seventh,\" he said. \"I told her to make it 24 – it doesn't matter, anyway.\"</p><p>But he was wrong and now plans to use his winnings to establish a foundation for addicts and women abused by their husbands.</p><p>The 55-year-old resident of Gyor, north-west Hungary, said his first act was to repay his debts, before cycling to a car dealer. \"When the car salesman asked me how much I would be willing to spend, I held up three fingers. As I had arrived on a bike he assumed this meant 300,000 forints, but actually I meant 3m.\"</p><p>As neither he nor his wife can drive, the car will be driven only by his children.</p><p>Andraschek has since bought flats for each of his three children, paid off the debts of his relatives and is planning to travel to Italy, having not previously held a passport.</p><p>He and his wife, Anikó, said they will invest their money cautiously and avoid the ruinous spending splurges of many a lottery winner. \"I have become rich but I have not become a different person. I could buy a large-screen TV because I can afford it, but I won't buy three because I can afford it.\"</p><p>Having struggled with alcoholism, Andraschek finally quit five years ago and says he \"now has no need to return\".</p><p>The news of Andraschek's dramatic upturn in fortunes came as human rights activists organised a wave of protests worldwide against a new Hungarian law that bans sleeping rough, in a country that has 30,000 homeless people. Last week alone, demonstrations were held in front of Hungarian embassies and consulates in London, Paris, New York, Vienna, Lisbon, Dublin, Brussels, Essen and Istanbul. Next weekend a Hungarian NGO run by homeless people, A Város Mindenkié (The City is for All), will stage another protest in Budapest against the law, which threatens those living on the streets with a fine or imprisonment.</p>","headline":"Homeless Hungarian man hits lottery jackpot with his last few coins","trailText":"<p>László Andraschek plans to use his lottery winnings <br /> of £1.7m to set up foundation for addicts and abused women</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mnk2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392558589693/Homeless-Hungarian-man-L--001.jpg","wordcount":"427","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/16/homeless-hungarian-lottery-win-laszlo-andrasche","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/16/homeless-hungarian-lottery-win-laszlo-andrasche","tags":[{"id":"world/hungary","webTitle":"Hungary","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/hungary","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"society/homelessness","webTitle":"Homelessness","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/homelessness","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429954813","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392558589693/Homeless-Hungarian-man-L--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"BorsOnline","photographer":"H Baranyai Edina","altText":"Homeless Hungarian man László Andraschek","height":"84","credit":"H Baranyai Edina/BorsOnline","caption":"László Andraschek, a homeless Hungarian man who won the country’s biggest ever lottery prize of 630m forint.

They have all stressed that Madrid would probably block Scotland for fear that otherwise the growing movement for Catalan independence would become irresistible.</p><p>But the language being used by the Spanish government does not support these dire predictions. In a recent interview the Spanish foreign minister, José Manuel Garcia-Margallo, stated that a Scottish EU application should be considered in the event of a Yes victory in the referendum. He went on to insist: \"If Britain's constitutional order allows – and it seems that it does – Scotland to choose independence, we have nothing to say about this.\"</p><p>More strikingly he went out of his way to distance himself from suggestions that the Scottish and Catalan cases were inseparable for Madrid. \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/977a39ea-8c26-11e3-9b1d-00144feab7de.html#axzz2tZA3Nua2\" title=\"\">The two issues are 'fundamentally different'</a>,\" he declared.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a referendum victory for Scottish independence would have to be followed by detailed negotiations on a host of practical issues between Edinburgh and London, and between both Edinburgh and London and Brussels. But suggestions that these negotiations might stretch into the indefinite future are baseless. Scotland has already accepted a mountain of detailed EU law as part of the UK.</p><p>Two issues which require sensitive handling are fishing policy – where Edinburgh may seek some adjustments in the current regime – and, more importantly, whether and in what form it should be committed to eventual membership of the euro. Most insiders in Brussels believe there is little reason to doubt that negotiations could be wrapped up in about two years after the referendum if the Yes campaign emerges victorious.</p><p>It cannot be stressed too often that there is no provision in EU law for, in the meanwhile, depriving Scottish EU citizens of their existing rights as EU citizens. Such a step can in EU law can only be contemplated when an existing member state has been legally shown to have committed serious violations of European democratic or human rights provisions.</p><p>In the hullabaloo created by English Tory and Scottish unionist politicians, one critical question has been overlooked. Without Scotland could the present UK state be regarded it as the same state it was? A United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland it would no longer be. If so, why should the status of the \"rump UK\" be any different to that of Scotland?</p><p>Whatever answer is given to this question, it is certain that the London government will have to negotiate with Brussels about some key aspects of Britain's EU membership. These include its voting power in the Council of Ministers and its representation in the European parliament – both of which will have to be reduced because its population will have decreased.

It is a magnificent, thrilling and uplifting movie, and this award, along with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-chiwetel-ejiofor-best-actor-12-years-a-slave\">the best actor prize for its male star Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>, partly soothed my feeling that there were some exasperating misjudgments amid the good choices at this year's Baftas. 12 Years a Slave could – and should – have been better rewarded than this.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-413628462\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/7/25/130725Gravity-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/7/25/130725Gravity-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/7/25/130725Gravity_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/7/25/130725Gravity/130725Gravity.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>I also share the widespread feeling that Jennifer Lawrence's stock price has now peaked. Lovable though Lawrence is on- and off-screen, it isn't at all clear that she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-jennifer-lawrence-supporting-actress-american-hustle\">deserved a best supporting actress prize for her role in David O Russell's American Hustle</a>, ahead of contenders including Lupita Nyong'o and Sally Hawkins.<br />  <br />These Bafta awards turned out to be the event where the sci-fi thriller Gravity, like Mo Farah, triumphantly asserted its British status, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-gravity-outstanding-british-film\">winning best British film</a>, in spite of some mutterings about its passport. Given that its remarkable technology and effects were magicked up in the UK, probably only a curmudgeon would object too vehemently. Along with the award for original music and sound, Gravity also picked up a supremely deserved Bafta for best visual effects. The cinematography prize for Emmanuel Lubezki, meanwhile, was fitting, because Gravity was such a thrillingly immersive visual spectacle – although I thought Sean Bobbitt, the director of photography for 12 Years a Slave, was by a whisker the better choice.<br />     <br />But for me, Alfonso Cuarón's best director Bafta for Gravity was, to put it delicately, a surprise. It is a really terrific film – almost sensually pure entertainment in the truest, most old-fashioned sense of Hollywood cinema. I don't retract a word of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/gravity-review\">my five-star rave.</a> Yet I didn't think the direction was absolutely the best thing about it, and at the risk of churlishness, Steve McQueen was the better choice to win as director. </p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-425212627\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/17/131217AmericanHustle-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/17/131217AmericanHustle_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/17/131217AmericanHustle_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/17//131217AmericanHustle.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2013/12/17/131217AmericanHustle/131217AmericanHustle.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>As for Paul Greengrass's Captain Phillips, newcomer Barkhad Abdi made a brilliant impression as the desperate Somali pirate who boards Tom Hanks's colossal container ship, a symbol of Western prosperity under attack. But even the film's fans, of whom I am one, might be bemused that this is what has earned it a Bafta, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-captain-phillips-supporting-actor\">Abdi's performance is considered better than Michael Fassbender's in 12 Years a Slave</a>.<br />     <br />One thing was resoundingly right: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-cate-blanchett-best-actress\">Cate Blanchett's best actress Bafta</a> for Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine – a brilliantly detailed and muscular performance, theatrically vehement when it needed to be and subtly shaded at the right times, too.<br />     <br />American Hustle is such an enjoyable film, and it's great to see a comedy do well in awards ceremonies that traditionally reward seriousness and solemnity. Its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-best-original-screenplay-american-hustle\">award for best original screenplay</a> is, in many ways, an exhilarating choice, as this was a film which seemed almost like free-form jazz – thumbing its nose at the verities of three-act screenplays and surmounting obstacles and having sympathetic characters. This was a film populated by chaotic, self-obsessed and entirely unsympathetic people. But the writing was great and the comedy was great. And the Bafta for best makeup and hair could have gone to no one else.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-426386730\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/06/14010612Years-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/06/14010612Years_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/06/14010612Years/14010612Years.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/06/14010612Years_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/06//14010612Years.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>Elsewhere, Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope's Philomena came away with best adapted screenplay, which was a pleasing event: the film is a heartfelt and candid true story to which Coogan and Pope brought a sure touch, creating a great role for Judi Dench, and a thoroughly engaging odd-couple relationship with its producer-actor Coogan.<br />     <br />Best documentary and best foreign film went to The Act of Killing and The Great Beauty respectively, which look to me like impeccable choices. And it is great to see the outstanding debut Bafta go to Kieran Evans for the excellent movie Kelly + Victor.</p><p>So: some mixed feelings at this year's Baftas. Gravity is an outstanding film and 12 Years a Slave partisans like me should be wary of sore-loser-ism, but there is always the possibility of a disconnect between the view of critics and those of awards voters. But I am still hoping for a big win, including best picture and best director, for Steve McQueen's masterly 12 Years a Slave at the Oscars.</p><p><strong><a
