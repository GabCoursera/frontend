Chelsea manager punished for 're-entering field' against Villa<br />• Independent commission will rule on punishment","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>José Mourinho is facing a fine of around £10,000 from the Football Association after the governing body charged him with improper conduct for re-entering the field of play in stoppage time during Chelsea's defeat at Aston Villa on Saturday.</p><p>The Portuguese, together with members of the home bench, had reacted to Ramires' ugly challenge on the Villa midfielder Karim El Ahmadi, a tackle that led to the Brazilian being dismissed and that prompted a mini pitch invasion from both dugouts. The match official, Chris Foy, ordered the managers, coaching staff and substitutes from the turf but Mourinho, who had become infuriated by the referee's performance, immediately came back on to the pitch, signalling for a \"timeout\", and was promptly sent to the stands by the official.</p><p>It was the second time the Chelsea manager has been dismissed this season – after an incident during his side's victory over Cardiff City in October for which he accepted an £8,000 fine – but will still only result in him being punished in the pocket rather than banned from the touchline should a commission now find him guilty. That body will meet because the Portuguese has committed a previous offence in the last 12 months, with the offence therefore considered to be \"non-standard\". The manager has until 6pm on Monday 24 March to respond to the charge and will now consider his options, but is likely to accept the charge.</p><p>\"José Mourinho has been charged by the FA following his side's game against Aston Villa on Saturday,\" read a statement from the governing body, who had spent this week reviewing footage of the incident before determining whether there was a charge to bring. The FA went on to stress that the offence centred upon his return to the turf: \"It is alleged the Chelsea manager's behaviour in re-entering the field of play in or around the 90th minute of the fixture and approaching the match referee amounted to improper conduct.\"</p>","headline":"José Mourinho facing £10,000 fine after FA charge of improper conduct","trailText":"José Mourinho is facing a

These things happen to the best teams and the best managers but those present on that sultry September night in Romania may not be entirely surprised by Moyes's travails at Manchester United.</p><p>The overriding sense was that he suspected his players could not out-pass Dinamo on their home turf, so the Scot attempted to counter technique-suffused Eastern European invention with long, high balls, strong set-pieces and a defensively configured five-man midfield. In other words, with pragmatism - tactically his default setting.</p><p>Given precisely the same Everton players, Brendan Rodgers, Roberto Martínez, Gus Poyet, Mauricio Pochettino and Arsène Wenger – to name just five, others such as Manuel Pellegrini could also be included – would surely have taken an alternative route.</p><p>Forget the subtle differences between them. Their respective variations in formation and assorted nuances when it came to natural width versus diamonds – let alone the vexed question of deploying one or two strikers – are mere semantics. The important thing is that the quintet would all have tried to pass and move their way through the tie.</p><p>All five might well have lost that tie but the philosophy and principles which have defined their football careers contrast with Moyes's essential pragmatism and arguably explain why they are impressing while Manchester United's Scottish manager is not.</p><p>Although Pochettino's Southampton and their near unique style of pressing sets them a apart, the Argentinian shares one integral feature with Rodgers, Martínez, Poyet and Wenger: an unwavering faith in his football philosophy and a determination to stick to principles through thick and thin.</p><p>Rodgers endured a bit of a slow, sticky start at Liverpool but the former Swansea manager held his nerve, set out his slick passing vision, imbued the club with a coaching culture big on control and cleverness, both on and off the ball, and is now reaping the rewards in thrilling fashion.</p><p>Admittedly Rodgers' Liverpool feature a few more accurate long passes – often delivered by Steven Gerrard – than his old über-pure Swansea side but their superb football is the realisation of a long-cherished dream nurtured between the pages of the 180-page dossier - or personal managerial manifesto - he submitted to the Anfield board before being offered the job.</p><p>While Moyes's United, like his Everton, have at times played some pleasing enough football, the mish-mash of different systems and styles Sir Alex Ferguson's successor has experimented with suggest a pragmatist too busy fire-fighting and attempting to achieve reasonable short-term results to properly address the need for a defined ethos.</p><p>The result is that no one really knows what United currently stand for. True Moyes lacks, among others, strikers of the calibre of Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge but would he really have re-invented Jordan Henderson as successfully as Rodgers?</p><p>On the subject of discernible identity, the good news for Sunderland is that Gus Poyet's side are beginning to possess one. After years of, at their best, being all about energy and effort, Poyet is creating a club culture based on patient possession, building from the back and smart passing along the ground.</p><p>His arrival may have come too late to save them from relegation but at least the Wearsiders now have a belief system to cling on to - along with the hope that if the drop to the Championship can be avoided, Poyet's passing game will not only entertain but prove the best way of breaking the cycle of perpetual struggle into which the former \"team of all the talents\" have become locked. His wish that \"the ball should want to be cared for by our team\" is not only endearing but emblematic of a man capable of grasping the bigger picture.</p><p>Should Sunderland go down and Crystal Palace survive, Tony Pulis's advocates may claim that the high priest of anti-football pragmatism has scored a key victory – but can anyone really envisage a Pulis team thriving in the top half of the Premier League?</p><p>Tellingly just as Pulis seemed to hit a ceiling at Stoke City, Sam Allardyce's West Ham have spent much of this season demonstrating that such playing the percentages style anti-football can only take you so far.</p><p>The road between purist high priest - think Everton's Martínez - and Allardyce or Pulis-esque fundamentalist is winding and scenic with the Moyes and Alan Pardews of this world operating half-way houses.</p><p>José Mourinho is one of their neighbours but the Portuguese, cleverer and better resourced than the rest, has elevated pragmatism into something so close to an art form that he ranks as a special case.</p><p>That high priest of the counter-attacking game – Aston Villa's Paul Lambert – loosely belongs in this broad church, too – even if neither Moyes nor Pardew would ever be inclined to echo Lambert's recent claim that \"possession is over-rated\".</p><p>Like a lot of managers, the former pair are more about convenient coalitions of ideologies.

league but they remain in a very strong position. City will leapfrog them if they win their three games in hand, but Chelsea have the more favourable run-in.</p><p>They have to play both Liverpool and Arsenal, but do not have any other fixtures against teams in the top half of the table. The clubs engulfed in the relegation battle can pull off the odd upset – and José Mourinho's men still have to play three of the bottom five – but they do not have to face many teams vying for European places.</p><p>The defeat at Villa was Chelsea's first league loss since the start of December. They have picked up 2.36 points per game in 2014 and have boasted a strong defence, with Fabian Delph's flick only the fourth goal they have conceded in the league this calendar year.</p><p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p><p>Liverpool are the form team in the league and they are benefiting from having played fewer games than the teams around them. With nine matches still to play, Brendan Rodgers will believe his side have what it takes. They still have to face Manchester City and Chelsea but, with both matches at Anfield, they have the chance to hurt their rivals. They also have to play Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, who are in the top 10, but they have been struggling lately.</p><p>Since the turn of the year, Liverpool have averaged 2.6 points per game in an unbeaten run that includes comprehensive victories over Everton, Arsenal and Manchester United. Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge have contributed 3.2 goals per game in 2014 and have helped Liverpool become the leading scorers in the league with 75 goals. </p><p><strong>Arsenal</strong></p><p>Arsenal's win over Tottenham on Sunday gave them a timely boost but also served as a reminder that they are are not at the peak of their powers. Injuries have cost them recently, not to mention exhausting European away days, and they will need to improve if they are to come out on top at the end of the season.</p><p>Their true title credentials may well be known by the end of the month. They face both Chelsea and Manchester City before travelling to Everton in the first week of April. They could be out of the running very quickly, but three wins in those matches may well see them become favourites.</p><p>Arsenal have the same number of points and games to play as Liverpool, but their form will be a concern. An average of two points per game in 2014 is decent but they've dropped points in four of their last seven matches. Their defence has been solid this season but, with half as many goals scored per game in this calendar year as Liverpool (1.6), they are playing catch-up.</p><p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p><p>Manuel Pellegrini's men are the only side that know they will win the league if they win all of their remaining games. Such a feat is unlikely but, having been dumped out of the Champions League and FA Cup, they, like Liverpool, have one sole focus.</p><p>That said, with 11 games remaining, they still face a busy schedule, with a crucial game in hand against Aston Villa sandwiched between the last two games of the season. City, despite being favourites, could also see their chances alleviate or diminish sooner rather than later, with successive matches against Manchester United, Arsenal, Southampton and Liverpool to come in the next few weeks.</p><p>Again, like Arsenal they are not exactly in title-winning form. They've scored just four goals in their last game, with the absence of Sergio Agüero taking its toll. His fitness is likely to be a telling factor in the title race, with City averaging 3.33 goals per game in the 15 league matches he has started compared to 1.75 in the games he hasn't. It's now City's title to lose, but the form of Liverpool in particular will be a real worry to all those around them.</p><p><em>All statistics courtesy of <a

of being prejudiced in its handling of the club's bid to change their name to Hull Tigers.</p><p>The club released a statement on Tuesday afternoon in which they confirmed season pass holders will be balloted on the matter, responding to the FA's membership committee recommendation that the application to alter the club's existing name of Hull City be rejected.</p><p>The statement said: \"The club are disappointed with the timing of Monday's announcement made by the FA.</p><p>\"We feel we have been prejudiced right from the outset. The FA introduced a new policy to handle our application on the back of consultations with the City Til We Die group, and we therefore feel that our application was already pre-judged.</p><p>\"This feeling has been reinforced with Monday's announcement, as the club feel this will further prejudice the forthcoming ballot of season pass holders.</p><p>\"However, this is now the time for the silent majority to come forward and support the club's aspirations. Details of the ballot will be released to season pass holders within the next 48 hours.\"</p><p>The membership committee recommendation will be discussed and voted upon at a full FA Council meeting on 9 April.</p><p>Hull owner Assem Allam reiterated his intention to walk away from the club if his proposed name change is unsuccessful in the wake of Monday's announcement.</p><p>Allam's decision to apply to re-brand the club, which he insists is necessary in order to make it more marketable on the world stage, has been greeted angrily by fans, who have mobilised under the City Til We Die banner to fight the proposal.</p><p>However, their stance has been met in uncompromising fashion by the owner.</p><p>Speaking in January amid a furious backlash, he said: \"No-one on earth is allowed to question my business decisions. I won't allow it.</p><p>\"I can give you my CV to give you comfort, for what I do in business, what I have achieved, but for someone to come and question me is not allowed.</p><p>\"I'm here to save the club and manage the club for the benefit of the community. It will never, never be the other way round - that the community manage it for me.</p><p>\"But if the community say go away, I promise to go away within 24 hours.\"</p><p>Allam had earlier told fans singing \"City Til We Die\" during the Barclays Premier League clash with Crystal Palace in November they could \"die as soon as they want\" and labelled protesters \"hooligans\" and a \"militant minority\".</p><p>The Egyptian businessman took over the club in 2010 and oversaw their rise to the Premier League.</p><p>Steve Bruce's men are currently fighting to ensure their top-flight status but

He's sliding! He's still sliding! Here it comes! Wait for it … wait for it! Ohhhh! And there it is! That's gotta hurt! Gets me every time.\" To my shame, I am one of those people. Sorry, Phil.</p><p>Poor guy. The former Liverpool defender was just trying to prevent a shot from Pierluigi Casiraghi going in during a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in October 1998. Little did he know that something so inconsequential would still be so hilarious 16 years later.</p><p>If we are looking to apportion blame, though, then look no further than Premier League Years. It's all the fault of that evil, glorious, parasitic, wonderful, time-wasting work of art that is found lurking on Sky Sports in the afternoon or late at night, its siren call waiting to suck you in and ruin your day. If you have never watched it, it's highlights from a Premier League season. The voice of Premier League Years is Georgie Thompson, there is an era-specific backing track and there is always an emotional montage at the end, featuring the season's highs and lows. It also serves as an educational tool, with Thompson reminding us about what was going on in the real world at the start of each month. What better way to spend two hours?</p><p>The problem is that it's on all the time. There's a 77% chance that if you turn your television on now, the 1994-95 season will be there, waiting for you, just you, beckoning you into its warm embrace, and a 100% certainty that you won't change the channel. Shearer and Sutton. Kung-fu with Eric Cantona. Jürgen Klinsmann's belly flop. Four relegation places! Memories.</p><p>I am one of its victims. It has a hypnotic quality. I have seen each episode at least three … fine, 10 times and I'm probably into triple figures when it comes to the late-90s, if you'll allow me to boast for a moment. Yet for reasons that remain stubbornly unclear, it never gets old, even though they've started to mess around with the camera angles and introduce needless close-ups. Just like an episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a>, there's always something you missed the first time round, a player you forgot to reminisce about – such as Alan Thompson or Matt Jansen – or a Steve Guppy goal that is somehow even better after 27 viewings. Eventually it is all locked into my thoroughly useless mind palace.</p><p>Recently my flatmate insisted on watching the 2003-04 edition with me and was soon horrified to discover that I knew it off by heart. I was describing goals before they happened – Lilian Nalis's screamer in a 4-0 win for Leicester over Leeds, say – and reciting the dates of matches, even letting him know what I had done on certain days. The common mistake made by the football nerd (essentially the football hipster's weird uncle) is to assume that other people find this impressive. They don't. They find it terrifying, block your number and move out.</p><p>I had some free time before work the other day. I could have started that book, gone for a run or even had a shower. But instead, after a brief channel-hop, I struck gold: 1997-98, a vintage year. At first, I had no intention of staying with it. You never do. Only five minutes, you think to yourself, five minutes can't hurt, no one will know, it will be my little secret.</p><p>But 45 minutes later I was on a nostalgia-ridden trip down memory lane, somehow getting excited at hearing Martin Tyler scream: \"Would you believe it?\" as Tony Adams scored Arsenal's final goal in the 4-0 win over Everton that clinched the title. Arsenal, led by some French chancer <em>from Japan</em>, had swept past Manchester United to win the league, the defining moment coming when Marc Overmars earned them a 1-0 win at Old Trafford in March. That match was made unforgettable by the camera locating a particularly jubilant Arsenal fan – the one who Sky must have thought was Alan Davies – and soon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobSteinberg/status/433224128313962496\" title=\"\">I was trying to find out what had happened to him in the subsequent years</a>. It turns out he still goes to Arsenal and can sometimes be spotted in the pub before matches. Incredible.</p><p>Elsewhere Kenny Dalglish carefully dismantled Newcastle with some typically astute signings; Gerry Francis looked exactly as he does now; Tottenham's Christian Gross worked out how to use the tube; West Ham signed Samassi Abou; Paulo Wanchope and Francesco Baiano wreaked havoc for Derby County and Everton stayed up by the skin of their teeth on a manic final day thanks to their superior goal difference over luckless Bolton Wanderers.</p><p>If there is one negative, it is that sometimes you have to tolerate archive footage of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/richard-keys\" title=\"\">Richard Keys</a> presenting and I find it impossible not to hear a sexual innuendo in his every utterance. \"Arsenal need one more push,\" Keysie winks. \"How much do they want it … Tony Adams.\" But it's a small price to pay.</p><p>The appeal of Premier League Years is simple: nostalgia. This isn't a lament for the good old days. But supporters love to talk about the good old days and you get to see matches that were played at Highbury and Highfield Road, and muse that Darren Huckerby never did quite realise his potential. Nottingham Forest feature a couple of times; Swindon Town too. The kits and hairstyles are ridiculous, the pundits' blazers are even worse and you always know the ending.</p><p>Sometimes you might find yourself hoping for a different outcome for your side, praying that they might avoid relegation this time, and yet the story never changes. It makes no sense that it should be so gripping. But anyone who claims otherwise is a liar. We are the Premier League Years generation. They played The Time of My Life over one montage once and I don't need any more convincing than that.</p>","headline":"Premier League Years: Sky Sports' evil, glorious, parasitic work of art","trailText":"<p><strong>Jacob Steinberg: </strong>The only negative in this hypnotic football highlights show – apart from footage of Richard Keys – is that it's on all the time</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394641785151/Leicester-v-Nottm-Forest--004.jpg","wordcount":"1080","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-21T12:56:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/18/premier-league-years-sky-sport-tv","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/18/premier-league-years-sky-sport-tv","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"media/sky-sports","webTitle":"Sky Sports","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-sports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/sky-sports","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/sport-tv","webTitle":"Sport TV","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sport-tv","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/sport-tv","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jacob-steinberg","webTitle":"Jacob Steinberg","r2ContributorId":"33875","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/1/6/1357492202523/Jacob-Steinberg-byline-002.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jacob is a football and tennis writer for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-steinberg","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jacob-steinberg","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432383626","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394633760827/Richard-Keys-006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Stuart Franklin","altText":"Richard Keys","height":"255","credit":"Stuart Franklin/Getty Images","caption":"It is impossible not to hear a sexual innuendo in Richard Keys' every utterance on the Premier League Years.

The players, of whom one third were from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, also overwhelmingly backed the 'Rooney rule' being brought into English football to give black coaches more of an opportunity.</p><p>The survey follows high-profile criticism of Kick It Out by players such as Jason Roberts and Rio Ferdinand following the John Terry and Luis Suarez racist abuse cases.</p><p>Results of the poll show:</p><p>• 57 per cent of players have witnessed, and 24 per cent have been subjected to, racist abuse in stadiums. Seven per cent of players have been subjected to, and 20 per cent have witnessed, racist abuse on the training ground or in the dressing room.</p><p>• 62 per cent of players felt mandatory shortlisting should be in place for black and minority ethnic candidates applying for coaching or administration jobs in football.</p><p>• 39 per cent of players have witnessed homophobic abuse in stadiums and witnessed it on the training ground or in the dressing room.</p><p>Paul Mortimer, the former Charlton and Crystal Palace player who was appointed as Kick It Out's professional player engagement manager partly in response to criticism of the campaign, said carrying out the survey was an important first step.</p><p>He told Press Association Sport: \"These statistics show what players see from the pitch and in the training grounds. Now we have these figures we can go ahead and do something about it, pinpoint areas and put strategies in place.\"</p><p>The backing for the Rooney rule, named after the regulation in American football where clubs have to interview at least one black or ethnic minority candidate when appointing coaches, came from both black and white players.</p><p>Mortimer added: \"In fact the biggest portion of support for that were white players, across the board people looked at that. I am a black coach who found it difficult to find management roles and all you want is a fair opportunity to fight for the job, to be able to be interviewed and judged, and to know what the procedure is and for it to be transparent.\"</p><p>The results showed 65 per cent of players were aware of the process to report abuse and were confident about doing so, while 91 per cent said social media has led to a big increase in abuse.</p><p>\"It is a huge problem,\" added Mortimer. \"We have a reporting app which players can report social media abuse on and we also want to educate people how to handle abuse, such as not responding in person.\"</p><p>Mortimer has held talks with Kick It Out's leading critics Jason Roberts and Jason Brown, and plans to speak to Rio Ferdinand too.</p><p>He said: \"What I am trying to say to all of them is that has happened and now it's where we go from there. From now onwards we can come together and really be a voice, but if there are factions it loses power.\"</p><p>• The Football Association has launched four short animated films detailing exactly what to do if players or fans encounter discrimination while attending or taking part in a football match.</p><p>The films, available to view on <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/\" title=\"\">www.fa.com</a>,

Yet writing on his weekly blog, the Spaniard attempted to strike an optimistic note. \"The storm will pass and the sun will rise again,\" he said. \"I have no doubt. Besides, no one said this would be easy, but this is football. It gives you fantastic moments but also very hard times you have to cope with, when you have to show pride and professionalism until the end. And when all this is gone I'm sure I will be a more mature footballer.</p><p>\"I'll be very honest: on a day like this it's not easy to write the blog. I even thought it would be better to keep quiet and not to write, for I know many fans are really upset now, and so are we. However, there is a commitment I made to update the blog every week. So far in these two seasons I haven't failed to do it one single time, and I won't fail in the future either. No matter how sad things may look.\"</p><p>Mata, the club's record £37.1m signing, claimed that the build-up to the Liverpool, game had been good. \"I have to say that our week at the training ground had been good and we were very hopeful ahead of this derby. However, on the day of the match everything went bad. It was a tough defeat and I want to tell you that we will give everything we have in order to forget about this in the remaining games. And there is a very important one around the corner. We know the history of this club and its achievements, based on a winning spirit. That is what we need to beat Olympiakos and get through in the Champions League [on Wednesday evening].\"</p><p>He also hailed the club's fans. \"There are no words to describe your support in the stadium,\" Mata added. \"In games like yesterday it makes me mad not being able to give you what you deserve. I know there is nothing I can say right now, but at least I want you to know how I feel.\"</p>","headline":"Juan Mata: 'The sun will rise again at Manchester United'","trailText":"Juan Mata has

</video><h2>1) Time is running out for David Moyes</h2><p>The sorry truth for David Moyes is that it is getting worse, not better. Manchester United's crowd may have held off from turning against the team but everything else is going wrong and there is still the distinct possibility of at least more grievous setback over the coming games. On Wednesday, Moyes's team face Olympiakos with a 2-0 deficit from the first leg of their Champions League tie. To put that into context, United have won only one home game all season by more than three goals, and that was a Capital One Cup tie against an uninterested Norwich City side in October. West Ham are the opponents at the weekend and then it is Manchester City at home next Tuesday. For Moyes, tactically out-thought by Brendan Rodgers and incapable after this latest ordeal of offering any plausible explanation, the worry must be how long the supporters can hold their patience. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Manchester United 0-3 Liverpool</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/16/manchester-united-liverpool-five-talking-points\" title=\"\">• Five talking points from Old Trafford</a></p><h2>2) Mourinho might get his way over referee Foy</h2><p>If José Mourinho gets his way, Chris Foy's employers, Professional Game Match Officials Limited, will \"analyse\" the matches that the referee has taken charge of involving Chelsea over the last few years and come to the conclusion that he should not be officiating any more of the club's fixtures. The dismissals of Willian (harsh) and Ramires (as clear a red card as you could wish to see) in Saturday's damaging 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa means that Foy has sent off six Chelsea players, as well as Mourinho, in his last eight matches involving the London club. \"Maybe it is helpful that the [PGMOL] committee doesn't send him to our matches,\" Mourinho suggested at Villa Park. The reality, of course, is that clubs are in no position to draw a line through a referee's name and tell the PGMOL to keep the official well away from them. A few months ago Southampton tried going down that path with Mark Clattenburg, after making a formal complaint about comments the referee was alleged to have made to Adam Lallana in December, but the official was cleared of any wrongdoing and he has since taken charge of one of their matches. Officially, the PGMOL will adopt the same stance with Foy, although it is also a fair bet that when officials are being allocated games between now and the rest of the season, the Merseyside referee will not be anywhere near a Chelsea fixture. In other words, Mourinho will probably get what he wants. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/aston-villa-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Aston Villa 0-1 Chelsea</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/16/champions-league-schedule-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">• Mourinho's 'uncaring' claims not supported by the facts</a></p><h2>3) Arsenal urgently need a new striker</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-432276263\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/17/140317Arsenal-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/17//140317Arsenal.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/17/140317Arsenal_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/17/140317Arsenal_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/17/140317Arsenal/140317Arsenal.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>It has been pointed out often this season that Arsenal have only one top class centre forward. How can a team with just the one top class striker, the punditry class have demanded to know, hope to compete for honours? How can this possibly have been allowed to happen? Is it not an example of extreme managerial debauchery/secretly quite funny that after seventeen years in the job and an endlessly multi-tiered planning process, Arsene Wenger has managed to assemble a squad containing eleven international class midfielders capable of playing in the Wenger-catnip inside forward role, but only one central striker?</p><p>Actually it's worse than that, as at times recently Arsenal have almost seemed to be playing with no strikers at all. At White Hart Lane Olivier Giroud played not so much as a false nine as a bogus nine, scarcely affecting the game at all, occasionally breaking into an almost-sprint and generally looking a shadow of the striker who scored eight goals in his first twelve matches and had seemed so brilliantly capable as a conduit through which Aaron Ramsey in particular could forage close to goal. Since the end of November Giroud has five goals in 15 Premier League games which, in tandem with Yaya Sanogo's failure to score in six Arsenal appearances to date adds up to a centre forward shaped hole, not to mention a huge amount of goalscoring weight on the shoulders of that midfield. Giroud in particular has been a game and effective lone striker, but he looks tired and distracted, and when he's short of his best, even quite ordinary.</p><p>By way of contrast, and proof given the scoreline that football can be a perverse game, Emmanuel Adebayor was the best player on the pitch at White Hart Lane, linking the play athletically and hurling himself at Spurs' barrage of long passes. It has of course been a fraught few weeks, with the latest update chez Giroud suggesting his wife Jennifer has insisted on a move back to France where, apparently, nobody in public life ever has an extra-marital affair. Giroud has also been spotted having dinner in Hampstead with 'super agent' Muzzi Ozcan. It seems quite possible his career in England might not survive the summer, at which point Wenger really must buy a striker not from the upper reaches of the second tier - as Giroud is - or a hopeful might-never-be like Sanogo, but a genuine high grade title-winning striker for an Özil-sized amount of money, plus at least one other in support. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-432278684\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/17/140317Tottenham-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/17//140317Tottenham.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/17/140317Tottenham_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/17/140317Tottenham_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/17/140317Tottenham/140317Tottenham.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Arsenal</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/16/tottenham-tim-sherwood-arsenal-sound-fury\" title=\"\">• Full-throttle Tottenham fail to calm Sherwood's fury</a></p><h2>4) Marshall may be the league's best goalkeeper</h2><p>David de Gea was voted the Premier League's outstanding goalkeeper last season. At various points this season, the Spaniard, Simon Mignolet, Petr Cech, Hugo Lloris and Wojciech Szczesny have had claims to the same title. Yet each has had a flawed campaign. In contrast, the overworked Cardiff City's David Marshall has been consistently superb. It took a deflection and a mishit to beat the Scot on Saturday and it was the latest in a long line of terrific performances from him. While players at the wrong end of the table rarely receive individual accolades, it is to be hoped many of his fellow players remember his brilliance when casting their votes for the places in the PFA's team of the season. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/everton-cardiff-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Everton 2-1 Cardiff City</a></p><h2>5) Is Schneiderlin a leftfield option for Hodgson?</h2><p>The England manager travelled to the south coast largely to admire the burgeoning talent of Luke Shaw and to confirm Adam Lallana as a dead cert for his final World Cup squad, but Roy Hodgson had his attention grabbed by several other players in Southampton shirts – one of whom he has never even considered for the national side. Rickie Lambert's introduction as a second-half substitute may have been explosive enough to convince Hodgson that he should go to Brazil ahead of Jermain Defoe. Lambert scored a goal within a minute of coming on and later produced a neat assist for Jay Rodriguez. Rodriguez, meanwhile, gave a tireless display and the very fact that he was initially selected by Mauricio Pochettino to be the principal striker ahead of the more experienced Lambert was testament to his growing stature at the club. His goal and a blistering second-half shot which smacked the bar showed he has an eye for the net. But there was a third Saints player who shone as Southampton dispatched Norwich: the midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin. He has played at all age-levels in the France youth set-up from under-16 to under-21, but has yet to make his full debut for <em>Les Bleus</em>. And, having lived in England for five years, he could yet qualify for Hodgson's squad on account of the residency rule. Schneiderlin quipped after the match that he is open to possibilities. One wonders if Hodgson is? <strong>Jonny Weeks</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/southampton-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Southampton 4-2 Norwich City</a></p><h2>6) Cup distraction may drag Hull into the mire</h2><p>Hull's season ticket holders are to be balloted on the club's proposed name change to Hull Tigers ahead of a decision by the Football Association in April. However, the presence of something else next month could have just as significant an impact on their future. A first FA Cup semi-final for 84 years, against Sheffield United at Wembley, has the potential to cause a distraction during a run of four matches which appear pivotal to the quest to preserve Premier League status. West Brom and Swansea visit the KC Stadium either side of visits to Stoke and West Ham, and although Steve Bruce's side have steered clear of the bottom three for the majority of the season they are still eight points shy of the safety target their manager has set, sparking fears amongst a fringe of fans that they could yet suffer the same fate as Wigan in 2012-13. <strong>Richard Gibson</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/hull-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Hull City 0-2 Manchester City</a></p><h2>7) Odemwingie's goal and the offside shouts that never were</h2><p>Stoke's match with West Ham featured two interesting and relatively unusual applications of the offside law. One saw a Kevin Nolan goal disallowed even though there was a defender between him and the goal, because Asmir Begovic had rushed beyond him in the moments before the ball was played. As the ball rolled into the net Stoke's players clearly felt they had conceded, and Nolan was positively apoplectic when he spotted the raised flag, but the decision was undoubtedly correct. A more interesting incident occurred at the same end, in front of the same assistant, a little earlier in the game when a Stoke corner led to an outbreak of penalty-area chaos. As Stephen Ireland sent the ball into the box Peter Odemwingie was stationed on the toes of the West Ham goalkeeper, Adrián. The Hammers had Andy Carroll standing level with the near post, perhaps three yards from the goal-line, Mark Noble at the back post, and Stewart Downing in between, a yard or so upfield of Odemwingie. Peter Crouch won the initial header, and both Adrián and Carroll, in their attempts to keep the ball out, moved behind the goal-line. That left Noble level with Odemwingie, with Stewart still a yard upfield, when the ball fell back to Crouch, who athletically steered it into Odemwingie's shoulder, and thence into goal. In other words, Odemwingie was surely offside, being \"nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent\", with both opponents beyond said goal line irrelevant. No flag was raised, nor apparently were any objections by players or pundits, but it did look like an error. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/stoke-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Stoke City 3-1 West Ham</a></p><h2>8) Graceful Swans could disappear from top flight</h2><p>Too good to go down? I vowed I'd never fall for that one again after reporting Nottingham Forest's relegation in Brian Clough's last game in charge. Forest played their pleasing passing game all the way down to the Championship, the memory of which came to mind as Swansea did likewise in losing at home to West Bromwich Albion. The graceful Swans are a delight to watch but they are without a win in seven matches under the interim management of Garry Monk, whose inexperience does not augur well. <strong>Joe Lovejoy</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/swansea-city-west-brom-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Swansea City 1-2 West Bromwich Albion</a></p><h2>9) Woodrow zest gives Fulham hope</h2><p>In his two senior appearances Cauley Woodrow has not yet to show a well-honed predatory instinct but his performances have nonetheless put Fulham's more experienced forward to shame. The 19-year-old has led the line and linked up with a dynamism that the likes of Dimitar Berbatov, Darren Bent, Hugo Rodallega and (the possibly injured) Kostas Mitroglou have lacked. If Fulham are to escape relegation they could do with Woodrow making another creaking veteran look bad next weekend, when he will likely come up against Martín Demichelis. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/fulham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Fulham 1-0 Newcastle</a></p><h2>10) Sunderland should gamble on playing two strikers</h2><p>Sunderland are not the first side, and will not be the last, to come unstuck against the horrific brand of 'anti-football' Tony Pulis has introduced at Palace. Even so Gus Poyet currently lacks the right personnel to make his beloved 4-1-4-1 system and patient possession-based gameplans work properly. In the medium term Poyet's principles appear the key to Sunderland emerging from years of struggle but, with avoiding the relegation the immediate priority, he should surely tweak the formation and ask Fabio Borini to operate as a central striker playing off Jozy Altidore in a 4-1-3-2 formation. This configuration arguably needs to accommodate the frequently overlooked and regularly under-achieving yet undeniably gifted Italy international Emmanuele Giaccherini but if it comes down to a straight choice between Sebastian Larsson and Jack Colback in central midfield, Colback should surely win every time. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/sunderland-crystal-palace-premier-league\" title=\"\">• Match report: Sunderland 0-0 Crystal Palace</a></p>","headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action","trailText":"<p><strong>Guardian writers: </strong>José Mourinho may get his way over Chris Foy, David Marshall deserves recognition and could Morgan Schneiderlin be an option for England?</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395050235386/Steven-Gerrard-006.jpg","wordcount":"2084","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-24T09:53:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/17/premier-league-ten-talking-points","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/17/premier-league-ten-talking-points","tags":[{"id":"football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action","webTitle":"Ten talking points from this weekend's action","type":"series","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/richard-jolly","webTitle":"Richard Jolly","rcsId":"Richard J","r2ContributorId":"35808","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-jolly","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/richard-jolly","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonny-weeks","webTitle":"Jonny Weeks","r2ContributorId":"35809","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonny Weeks works on the picture desk at the Guardian &amp; Observer and is also a writer and photographer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonny-weeks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jonny-weeks","references":[]},{"id":"profile/barneyronay","webTitle":"Barney Ronay","r2ContributorId":"21010","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/12/barney_ronay_140x140.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733869/BarneyRonay.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Barney Ronay is senior sports writer for guardian.co.uk.

games","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-16T22:30:01Z","sectionName":"Football","sectionId":"football","id":"football/2014/mar/16/jose-mourinho-chris-foy-referee-chelsea-aston-villa","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nhz7","standfirst":"• Manager wants authorities to analyse match official's record<br />• Aston Villa's Fabian Delph modest over winner against leaders","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>After vowing not to talk about the referee, José Mourinho was unable to keep his promise and went as far as to say that it would be \"helpful\" if Chris Foy was prevented from officiating at Chelsea matches in the future.</p><p>Seething at the end of a fractious evening in the Midlands, Mourinho called on the authorities to \"analyse\" Foy's record in Chelsea fixtures after implying that the official had brandished a disproportionate number of red cards. Emotions were running high at Villa Park after Willian and Ramires were both sent off – along with Mourinho – which means Foy has dismissed six Chelsea players in his last eight matches involving the club. Not that the Chelsea manager needed his memory to be jogged by statistics.</p><p>\"I know,\" Mourinho said. \"The players were speaking about it during the week. My philosophy is that I never care who the ref is, I don't want to know. I always think that the referee is a good referee but during the week the players were speaking about the situation and I think from now on, the next time we have Mr Foy, I have to work my people in a different way.\"</p><p>Asked whether that meant he would stop his players from turning it into an issue by talking about Foy in the lead-up to the referee's next Chelsea game, Mourinho replied: \"But do they [the players] have a reason? Maybe it is helpful that the [Professional Game Match Officials Limited] committee doesn't send him to our matches. I don't have the right to request [that]. I think they have to analyse the situation and see if every time he has Chelsea – or not every time – but many times he has Chelsea and problems are there, I think maybe it would be a good decision.\"</p><p>While the second yellow card that Foy showed Willian for a nudge on Fabian Delph seemed harsh, Chelsea could have no complaints about the straight red Ramires was given for a dreadful challenge on Karim El Ahmadi that sparked a mini-pitch invasion from both dugouts. Mourinho later accused Gabriel Agbonlahor, who had been withdrawn 15 minutes earlier, of grabbing Ramires by the neck.</p><p>\"I went to the pitch, as everybody went, with one single objective – me and Paul [Lambert, Villa's manager] and my assistants and Paul's assistants – that was to calm one situation in the last minute of the game. The result is done, there is no more story, let's go there to help,\" Mourinho said. \"At the same time Agbonlahor made an aggression on Ramires, which was a sad episode, but I didn't even try to stop Agbonlahor or to tell something to him – that's not my problem, he's not my player, I let Paul deal with it. I went there to try to calm and to try to say one little comment to Mr Foy, which he didn't allow.\"</p><p>Asked what that comment would have been, Mourinho said: \"If he's allowed, him and [Jonathan] Moss [the fourth official], that one player jumps from the dugout to make an aggression on another player.\"</p><p>While it remains to be seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/jose-mourinho-chelsea-manager-sent-to-stands\" title=\"\">whether Mourinho will face any punishment from the Football Association</a> for his conduct – a decision that will be taken after reviewing Foy's match report – the reality is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/aston-villa-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the three points the Premier League leaders dropped</a> are far more damaging than any potential touchline ban or fine. Chelsea will need to play with much more penetration and imagination in Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second leg game at home to Galatasaray if they are to get through.</p><p>At the same time, Aston Villa deserve huge credit for the way that they got under Chelsea's skin here and produced arguably their best performance since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/02/aston-villa-paul-lambert\" title=\"\">Lambert took over at the start of last season</a>. Disciplined and well-organised in the first half, Villa grew in confidence after the interval and made their numerical advantage count when the impressive Delph broke from deep and, with a wonderful piece of improvisation, converted Marc Albrighton's cut-back with a sumptuous flick.</p><p>\"I didn't think I was having one of my better games,\" Delph said. \"I thought Joe Bennett, having been out for so long, he was terrific.

The home win over West Ham means they have lost only once in their past seven fixtures, and they are 11th in the table, level on points with 10th-placed Aston Villa.</p><p>Eleventh in 2009-10 is the highest position Stoke have finished <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/06/stokecity\" title=\"\">since they were promoted in 2008</a>, and the defender Wilson said: \"The manager, staff and all the guys have been saying we want to keep this run going until the end of the season. We have eight games left. All the lads are focused on picking up as many points as we can, and we want to finish in the top 10.\"</p><p>The victory over West Ham provided further evidence that Mark Hughes's efforts since his appointment last summer to get Stoke playing a more flowing brand of football than in previous seasons are proving successful.</p><p>They fell behind early on to Andy Carroll's header but Peter Crouch's shot went in off Peter Odemwingie to equalise, around the half-hour mark and Stoke wrapped up the win in the second half with some eye-catching play. Marko Arnautovic slotted in at the end of a good passing move before Odemwingie smashed home to round off a counterattack.</p><p>Wilson said: \"We were playing some nice stuff and created a few chances. After we got the equaliser, apart from maybe a five to 10 minute spell in the second half, I could always see us winning. We haven't won by two goals in a while, so it is a good boost for us.\"</p><p>The midfielder Stephen Ireland, back in the Stoke side as a replacement for the suspended Jon Walters, was a key player, having a hand in all three of his team's goals. Ireland joined on a season-long loan from Aston Villa in September <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/14/stephen-ireland-stoke-aston-villa\" title=\"\">which was turned into a permanent deal in January</a>.</p><p>The 27-year-old Irishman is looking to rejuvenate a career that began so brightly at Manchester City, where Hughes was his manager for some of the time, but has since stalled with disappointing spells at Villa and Newcastle United on loan.</p><p>Hughes said: \"I know every time I bring Stephen into the team that he will give us quality and awareness of when to play the right pass, and he will always give you a goal threat too. I think now he is at a place where he knows he is appreciated and he knows he gets good work that will make him a better player.\"</p><p>Asked if Ireland would be with Stoke next season, Hughes said: \"I hope so – that is our intention. It is something I think both parties want. We are trying to get it done.\"</p><p>The defeat for West Ham was their second in a row, a double which has come off the back of four straight wins. Their manager Sam Allardyce, after sticking with the same first XI for several games, made four adjustments to his line-up for the game at Britannia Stadium and admitted he may have made a mistake in doing so.</p><p>He said: \"The changes were very difficult to make on the basis of what those who had played before had done. And it doesn't look like I should have made them to be honest - I think I might have made the wrong decision.\" Following the fourth of their quartet of wins, the Hammers had 31 points from 27 games.</p><p>And, having seen his side lose the two matches that have followed, Allardyce said: \"I have always told the players right from the very start - it is not about your position in the league, it is about having more points than games played, and that is diminishing again. We had put a nice distance between our points gained and games played, but it is diminishing and we need to stop that.\"</p>","headline":"In-form Stoke City aiming for first Premier League top-10 finish","trailText":"Stoke City's Marc Wilson believes his team can finish in their best-ever position in the Premier League after their 3-1 home win over West Ham","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/16/1394997101445/Peter-Odemwingie-006.jpg","wordcount":"637","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-19T22:19:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/stoke-city-top-10-finish-west-ham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/16/stoke-city-top-10-finish-west-ham","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/stokecity","webTitle":"Stoke City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/stokecity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/stokecity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/38"}]},{"id":"football/westhamunited","webTitle":"West Ham United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/westhamunited","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/43"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/38"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/43"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432238870","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/16/1394997089581/Peter-Odemwingie-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Dave Thompson","altText":"Peter Odemwingie","height":"54","credit":"Dave Thompson/PA","caption":"Stoke's Peter Odemwingie celebrates scoring his side's third goal against West Ham at the Britannia Stadium.

Manchester United continued with Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata moving inside into central positions, while Brendan Rodgers persevered with his midfield diamond, featuring Raheem Sterling at the top.</p><p>With Liverpool clearly dominating possession in the opening stages, neither side had a reliable attacking strategy. United had no serious counterattacking threat and were unable to feed their centre-forwards but Liverpool's dominance was not necessarily good for their attackers, either. Having grown accustomed to counterattacking at devastating speed, Liverpool did not turn their constant possession into scoring opportunities, and there were few clear-cut chances in the first half.</p><p>Nevertheless Liverpool were unquestionably on top throughout the game. Sterling darted from side to side, occupying Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini, which allowed the Liverpool midfielders on the outside of the diamond, Joe Allen and Jordan Henderson, into pockets of space between United players. Manchester United's full-backs were reluctant to come out of defence to meet them, primarily because this would open up space for Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suárez to move into in wider areas, exposing the United centre-backs to pace, something that became more obvious later.</p><p>Therefore Liverpool always had simple out-balls – diagonal passes into dangerous zones – but in open play they should have capitalised on these situations more. Neither Allen nor Henderson is naturally creative – Allen's a reliable passer, Henderson an energetic runner in this Liverpool side. Sterling is better at running with the ball than playing the final pass, while Suárez was uncharacteristically wasteful in possession.</p><p>Instead Liverpool's success was about constant pressure rather than repeated penetration. They won three penalties, each in wide areas of the box, in the channels. Liverpool could have been awarded at least two more, such was United's nervousness at the back.</p><p>This was the old-school Rodgers approach, the strategy from the start of last season: constant pressure through possession, with a belief that the more the opposition tire, the more they make mistakes. Only in the final 20 minutes, when United went chasing the game, did we witness the new-style Liverpool, playing on the break, with Suárez and Sturridge more involved.</p><p>Not that United's chasing was particularly nuanced: Moyes waited until the 76th minute before making two substitutions, Tom Cleverley for Fellaini and Danny Welbeck for Januzaj, which changed little. There was no attempt to improve the defensive shape, no substitution to help United cope in midfield and no action taken to change the misfiring front two. Moyes did not appear to understand how to fix United's problems, an analysis which also applies in a much broader sense.</p>","headline":"A narrow-minded affair sees Brendan Rodgers go old school at Old Trafford","trailText":"<strong>Michael Cox:</strong> David Moyes and Brendan Rodgers play a narrow-minded game","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/16/1395008007047/Manchester-United-v-Liver-004.jpg","wordcount":"439","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-19T22:06:59Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/manchester-united-liverpool-tactics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/16/manchester-united-liverpool-tactics","tags":[{"id":"football/football-tactics","webTitle":"Football tactics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football-tactics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football-tactics","references":[]},{"id":"football/manchester-united","webTitle":"Manchester United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchester-united","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/12"}]},{"id":"football/liverpool","webTitle":"Liverpool","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/liverpool","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"}]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michael-cox","webTitle":"Michael Cox","r2ContributorId":"39673","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Michael Cox is editor of <a href=\"http://www.zonalmarking.net/\">Zonal Marking</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-cox","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/michael-cox","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/12"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432248254","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/16/1395008001602/Manchester-United-v-Liver-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Action Images","photographer":"Jason Cairnduff","altText":"Manchester United v Liverpool - Barclays Premier League","height":"54","credit":"Jason Cairnduff/Action Images","caption":"Brendan Rodgers set Liverpool up with a midfield diamond featuring Raheem Sterling at the top against Manchester United.

He enjoyed the new view so much that he says his new spectacles are \"lucky\" and he will wear them again next weekend, when he will need all the charms he can get, as Fulham go to Manchester City. \"Everything is possible in football, you can always win, even in Manchester,\" he said.</p><p>But what did he really see here? The emergence of a Fulham team who can escape relegation? Or just the visit of uniquely obliging opponents? Newcastle played with all the urgency of a team ensconced in mid-table and the quality of one missing most of their creative players, especially the injured Loic Rémy and Hatem Ben Arfa. They were also missing their manager but Alan Pardew's enforced exile made little difference to the result even if it felt odd to his staff, who must get used to the experience quickly as Pardew has two more matches of his stadium ban to serve.</p><p>\"The buildup was normal as it is for every game but it was a bit strange getting on the bus without him,\" said the man who directed operations from the dugout in Pardew's absence, the assistant manager, John Carver. \"He's our leader and rightly so but once you get to the stadium and your workload kicks in it was like any other game. We had a couple of conversation on the phone, but it is strange when your boss is not here. But he said he has a lot of faith in his staff. We have a lot of experience in the technical area so the fact he only contacted us twice during the game meant he must have been happy. So I don't think it was detrimental to the way we played.\"</p><p>Newcastle played the way Fulham have done for most of the season: in spurts and without enough quality. Fulham, in an encouraging development, played with energy and cohesion for the full 90 minutes. Magath believes that was partially due to the injection of youth, as five changes to the starting line-up meant Fulham began with only two players over 30, the lowest number in a season where the club had placed most of its faith in veterans. Magath had started with that foundation too but demolished it after last week's dismal loss to Cardiff City.</p><p>His decisions were vindicated as David Stockdale performed splendidly in goal in place of Maarten Stekelenburg and the reintegration of Fernando Amorebieta into the defence coincided with a first clean sheet since December. Stockdale and Amorebieta had played many times already this season and contributed as much to some heavy defeats as they did to this victory so it remains to be seen whether the new-found solidity is durable.</p><p>The performance of 19-year-old Cauley Woodrow was a clear positive. He led the line with a zest not seen this season from any of the other six strikers Fulham have fielded, including their expensive recruits Kostas Mitroglu and Darren Bent, neither of whom were in the squad. The 17-year-old striker Patrick Roberts was among the substitutes instead.</p><p>Magath is now convinced that youthful audacity and dynamism trump craggy wiles. \"I thought in this situation the older players would be more confident but the young players like Woodrow are more exciting,\" he said. \"They give us a good mood, good vibrations. They have nothing to lose.\"</p><p>Woodrow's mobility and link-up play helped give shape to a Fulham side who has too often seemed amorphous this season and he almost claimed the goal that his display deserved when he turned the ball into the net early in the second half after Jonny Heitinga's long-range shot crashed out off the crossbar. But no goal was given as Woodrow has ventured offside.</p><p>Another feature of this campaign has been Fulham's tendency to shoot themselves in the foot even when playing well and William Kvist risked a relapse when he inadvertently presented Papiss Cissé with a clear shot at goal in the 66th minute. Stockdale saved and Fulham went straight down the other end and scored the winning goal as a mistake by Tim Krul allowed Ashkan Dejagah's 20-yard shot to find the net. Perhaps that change of fortune was more significant than any of the personnel alterations? Maybe Magath is right about his glasses.</p><p>Fulham are still four points form a position of safety - five if you factor in their disastrous goal difference - but their remaining fixtures include potentially pivotal clashes with fellow strugglers such as Crystal Palace, Norwich and Hull. And next weekend Woodrow is likely to come up against Martin Demichiles, another creaking veteran whom the youngster could make look bad.</p><p><strong>Man of the match </strong>David Stockdale (Fulham)</p>","headline":"Felix Magath's faith in young Fulham players rewarded against Newcastle","trailText":"Alan Pardew's stadium ban misery was complete after Newcastle lost 1-0 to the Premier League's bottom club Fulham","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/16/1394980311535/Felix-Magath-Fulham-Premi-006.jpg","wordcount":"788","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-19T22:04:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/16/felix-magath-fulham-newcastle-united-alan-pardew","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/16/felix-magath-fulham-newcastle-united-alan-pardew","tags":[{"id":"football/felix-magath","webTitle":"Felix Magath","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/felix-magath","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/felix-magath","references":[]},{"id":"football/fulham","webTitle":"Fulham","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/fulham","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/55"}]},{"id":"football/newcastleunited","webTitle":"Newcastle United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/newcastleunited","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/31"}]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/pauldoyle","webTitle":"Paul Doyle","rcsId":"GNL034658","r2ContributorId":"16231","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Doyle is the  <br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">chief football writer for guardian.co.uk</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pauldoyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/pauldoyle","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/31"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/55"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432222218","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/16/1394980303274/Felix-Magath-Fulham-Premi-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Matt Dunham","altText":"Felix-Magath-Fulham-Premier-League","height":"54","credit":"Matt Dunham/AP","caption":"Fulham's manager Felix Magath is all smiles after watching his side beat Newcastle 1-0 at Craven Cottage.

In the morning he had become the highest-profile footballer to announce he is gay, and in the hours afterwards he had not checked the public reaction. When I speak to him I tell him that support has been flooding in from fans, fellow footballers, well-wishers – and yes, even Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband.</p><p>\"But where's David Cameron?\" the former Germany international asks with playful indignation. \"He's a Villa supporter, after all!\" The prime minister, as it turns out, would soon add his voice to a raft of high-profile well-wishers that included Angela Merkel, the German national team manager Joachim Löw, and the former German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle, who is also gay.</p><p>They all talked about the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder's \"courage\" in breaking one of sport's last great taboos: Hitzlsperger, capped 52 times by his country, is the first German footballer to reveal he is gay. He is also the first former Premier League footballer to do so.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426663313'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218698171/Thomas-Hitzlsperger-in-hi-001.jpg' alt='Thomas Hitzlsperger in his Everton days' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Thomas Hitzlsperger in his Everton days. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</figcaption></figure><p>It was a moment he always knew would come, and one he dreaded. The decision to address this issue publicly was a \"hard, difficult one\" that took a number of years to gestate, he tells me. The 31-year-old, who retired from the game last year because of injuries, first told his friends and family.</p><p>\"I was surprised and happy that they were all totally OK with it. Where I come from, in rural Bavaria, homosexuality is considered 'un-normal'. I knew that there would be negative reactions from those who will never understand it, also towards my family, but that didn't bother them. I've had nothing but total support from them.\"</p><p>Hitzlsperger, who was engaged to his childhood sweetheart and broke up with her shortly before the scheduled wedding six years ago, was not certain of his sexual orientation until his career was almost over. \"I finally figured out that I preferred living with a man,\" he says.</p><p>He had thought about coming out while still playing for Wolfsburg in 2011-12 but then listened to people who warned him of the negative consequences. \"They all said 'don't do it, a big wave will crash on you',\" he says. \"But in the end I realised that nobody knows. There was no precedent, so everybody could only speculate on what would happen.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426663314'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218865897/Hitzlsperger-in-action-fo-004.jpg' alt='Hitzlsperger in action for Germany in one of his 52 appearances for his national side' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hitzlsperger in action for Germany in one of his 52 appearances for his national side. Photograph: Peter Kneffel/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>While Germany as a country has noticeably become more and more relaxed about homosexuality in recent years, he had also noted there was an unhelpful media obsession with finding the first gay footballer. All sorts of well-intended but ultimately unhelpful interventions from heterosexual players – who either opined that gay players would benefit from coming out or cautioned against it – did not exactly fill him with confidence that this was indeed the right step.</p><p>Homosexuality was rarely a big topic in any of the dressing rooms he encountered, he says, and \"the subject only came up when people were speculating about someone else's sexuality, but never in their presence.\"</p><p>There was the odd incidence of crass homophobia, as well, \"but that was just your general, non-specific football talk,\" says Hitzlsperger. \"I too, used derogatory terms like 'what a gay pass' without thinking about it when I was younger.\"</p><p>The former international, who played in the 2006 World Cup and the 2008 European Championship, maintains that he did not have to lie about his sexuality and that team-mates eventually stopped asking about his lack of a girlfriend.</p><p>In any case, he says, an ultimately fruitless battle to regain full fitness after a series of operations was more important to him than telling his colleagues about his sexual orientation.</p><p>The announcement of his retirement last September brought more time to think, however. \"It really helped me to see that other professional sports people were acknowledging their sexuality. I read about John Amaechi, Gareth Thomas and Tom Daley. They weren't footballers but the fact that they went public gave me the feeling that I was not alone. I began to think that I could help other footballers who might be in the same shoes, so that they could see that here's someone who was even an international. I wanted to encourage them, the way that those guys and Robbie Rogers encouraged me.\"</p><p>He closely studied the fall-out of their coming outs, too, he says, and felt empowered. \"They all said it was good for them.\" Hitzlsperger is unwilling to make wide-scale recommendations – \"everyone has to decide for themselves\" – and is unwilling to predict when the first active footballer in a European top league will follow his lead.</p><p>\"But the important thing for me is to show that being homosexual and professional football player is something that is normal. The perceived contradiction between playing football, the man's game, and being homosexual is nonsense. I don't think anyone has ever come away from watching a game with me thinking there's something wrong or 'too soft' with my game,\" he adds, with a chuckle.</p><p>Known as \"the Hammer\" among supporters because of his fierce shot with his left foot, Hitzlsperger always enjoyed a robust challenge.</p><p>\"You hear the word courage a lot,\" he says, when the talk  returns to the reactions he has experienced so far. \"That's nice to hear, but it's part of the problem, of course. That's something that should change. I sincerely hope that we'll see the when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances anymore, because it will be seen as totally normal that a sports person will speak about his homosexuality, the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends. It won't be easy for the next person to be the truly the first in that regard but maybe I've been able to help them a tiny bit.\"</p><p>Hitzlsperger, who has addressed issues such as racism and antisemitism in German football before, is acutely aware that there is a political dimension to his move, with the Olympic Games in Sochi about to begin. \"It's important to face up to nations that discriminate against minorities, sexual or otherwise,\" he says. \"I'm fine with the fact that my story will be mentioned in relation to the Games, because the situation in Russia is something that needs to be talked about. I'm curious to see what will happen. I'm sure that some athletes will make a stand\".</p><p>Hitzlsperger is under no illusion that football's attitudes will change overnight. On the day of his interview with the Guardian, the Paris St-Germain defender Alex, a former Chelsea player, insisted that \"god created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Yves\".</p><p>Hitzlsperger says: \"You'll always have those guys, but it's sad that they don't think a little deeper about what they're saying. I feel sorry for them, really\".</p><p>Still, the emphatically positive response by politicians, footballers and fans have left him in an optimistic mood and at ease with himself. \"It's good to know, not just for me but for others who are still playing now, that those at the top have no problem, that they support you. When the chancellor comes out in your favour, you know that it's safe being homosexual in this country, that you won't be discriminated. There will always be a small minority who think otherwise but hopefully, their numbers become fewer and fewer over the next years\".</p>","headline":"Thomas Hitzlsperger: 'I finally figured out that I preferred living with a man'","trailText":"<p>Former Premier League footballer and German international talks to <strong>Raphael Honigstein</strong> about how he wanted to tell the world he was gay while he was still playing in Germany for Wolfsburg, but was advised against it</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218560158/Thomas-Hitzlsperger-005.jpg","wordcount":"1204","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-11T22:09:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/08/thomas-hitzlsperger-gay-footballer-interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/jan/08/thomas-hitzlsperger-gay-footballer-interview","tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"football/bundesligafootball","webTitle":"Bundesliga","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/bundesligafootball","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/625"}]},{"id":"football/europeanfootball","webTitle":"European club football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/europeanfootball","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/europeanfootball","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"world/gay-rights","webTitle":"Gay rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/gay-rights","references":[]},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/sexuality","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/raphaelhonigstein","webTitle":"Raphael Honigstein","r2ContributorId":"19394","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/honigstein.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Raphael Honigstein is guardian.co.uk's German football correspondent.

Bale set to be first €100m player after Spurs-Real Madrid switch","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-26T20:40:42Z","sectionName":"Football","sectionId":"football","id":"football/2013/aug/26/garerth-bale-transfer-spurs-real-madrid","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ta9g","standfirst":"World record transfer likely to be confirmed this week as TV fuels European football's spending spree","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>At Real Madrid they have already erected a tented scaffold in one of the stands at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, a small stage upon which they hope the football world will focus later this week. Gareth Bale, the Cardiff boy who made good at Tottenham Hotspur, is set to be unveiled as the world's first €100m (£86m) footballer barring an unlikely counter bid from Manchester United. The Spanish economy may be wheezing in recession, but Real are intent upon bucking the trend.</p><p>Even by Real's standards the fee is staggering, considering this is a player who was almost sold by Tottenham Hotspur for next-to-nothing just four years ago and who has played only one season in Europe's elite competition, the Champions League. It is made more extraordinary because the Welsh international is likely never to feature in a World Cup: the ultimate marketing vehicle for the stars of the game – and their clubs.</p><p>But Real Madrid have been wooed by his recent consistent brilliance at White Hart Lane with the 24-year-old duly named both footballer of the year and young footballer of the year by his fellow professionals in April, having finished last season with 31 goals in all competitions. His move would eclipse the £80m paid by Real to take Ronaldo from Manchester United in 2009.</p><p>Completion of the transfer would be the high water mark of an unprecedented summer of spending across elite European football, as competing oligarchs buoyed by the soaring value of TV deals have lifted spending power across the continent's biggest clubs.</p><p>The Premier League may be about to lose one of its leading lights, but English top flight clubs have still forked out over £460m on players in the current transfer window. That figure will expand further ahead of next Monday's 11pm deadline for deals to be done, and should break the previous record of around £500m, established in 2008, for a single window's business.</p><p>A new £5.5bn television deal guarantees the Premier League's bottom club £63m – more than the champions, Manchester United, earned from the broadcasting pot last season. There is more money pouring into the top division than ever before and that is reflected in transfer fees that are often an expression of power in the game.</p><p>\"Football reflects life, albeit with a ball, so the rich just keep getting richer,\" said Jon Smith, co-founder of the leading First Artist Management agency. \"The rich clubs spend because they can.\"</p><p>Manchester City have spent a little under £100m almost unnoticed. Tottenham, even with Bale on his way out, have broken their own transfer record twice. Chelsea can sign a £30m player, in the Brazilian Willian, almost on a whim. And yet what makes this summer all the more unique is that, where Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, the Glazer family's Manchester United or even City under the Abu Dhabi United group used to splash the cash most extravagantly, alongside Barcelona and Real, now many more clubs across Europe have emerged to join the frenzy.</p><p>French champions Paris St Germain are under Qatari ownership and were able to pay £55m for Edinson Cavani, a Uruguayan forward previously at Napoli who had been courted by English clubs. AS Monaco, bankrolled by the Russian Dmitry Rybolovlev, only returned to the French first division at the end of last season but have spent over €150m in the hope of mustering an immediate title challenge. They beat sides at the top of the Premier League to buy Atlético Madrid's Colombian forward, Radamel Falcao, who cost an eye-catching £53m.</p><p>Germany's Bundesliga, which provided both finalists in last season's Champions League, has also benefitted from its own new broadcasting deal to emerge as a financial and footballing power. Bayern Munich, the reigning European champions, are now under the stewardship of Pep Guardiola – world football's most coveted coach – and were able to entice Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona earlier this summer just as Manchester United were preparing to announce the signing of the midfielder.</p><p>Barcelona took the brilliant Brazil striker Neymar from Santos for €50m to refresh their forward line. If suggestions the Catalan club have already recouped a large proportion of that fee in sales of Neymar's number 11 shirt seem far-fetched, they can at least expect to make a large chunk of that money back in global marketing monies alone. Indeed, all these mind-boggling deals were completed in a summer when Uefa's newly imposed Financial Fair Play rules were supposed to be taking effect, with clubs supposedly restricted to living within their means.</p><p>\"I just hope Uefa make sure it's Financial Fair Play for all, and not just those clubs who have the ability to sell their training ground more than once,\" said Smith.</p><p>That was said with tongue in cheek but reflects the potential loopholes in the Uefa president Michel Platini's plans for regulation. Real's pursuit of Bale has already drawn stinging criticism from the Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</p><p>\"It makes a joke of the FFP regulations,\" he said. \"I find it amazing that in the year the regulations come in, world football has gone completely crazy.\"</p><p>And yet Real consider the £86m arrival of a stellar player a means of reimposing their authority. The president, Florentino Perez, has personally driven the club's galactico culture for high-value players and was anxious to start his fourth term with a bang. An egotist and a populist, Perez is a figure who enjoys the summer months far more than the season itself because he can't control everything that happens out on the pitch. Real, who set the benchmark with the arrivals of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo, are about to establish a new world record fee. Football's spending has never been more lavish.</p><h2>Record signings<br /></h2><p><strong>1893 Willie Groves </strong>West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa

Instead they are regularly \"condemned to a weekly pattern of expensive parking and endless traffic jams.\"</p><p></p><p>The government is urged to take the lead by setting up free public transport with match tickets – along the lines of the popular and well-used KombiTicket in Germany – and individual clubs should routinely publish travel plans that include proposals for new facilities to improve access by walking and cycling as well as clear information about getting to the ground without a car. Transport operators should investigate a national football supporters' railcard with more flexible conditions, the report recommends.</p><p></p><p>Manchester United's Old Trafford ground comes 18th in the survey of 20 Premier League clubs and is described as \"a major ground served mainly by low-capacity public transport, travel planning nearly a decade out of date and without safe walking or cycling routes.\"</p><p></p><p>Bottom of the pile is Reading's Madejski stadium: \"comfortably the least accessible ground in this year's Premier League – out of town and virtually unreachable by regular public transport.\" And languishing at 19th is Queen's Park Rangers' ground, Loftus Road, where \"despite London's extensive public transport, QPR have no coherent travel plan and offer poor information on how to get to Loftus Road</p><p></p><p>Fans of Arsenal, in second place in the survey, make full use of good public transport links at the club's Emirates stadium, where the percentage of fans arriving by car has been reduced from 30% to 10% since moving from their old ground. And in third place, improvements to Fulham's Craven Cottage have led to a high proportion of supporters combining public transport with walking to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Other key findings from the fans' survey include: 23% of fans spend more on travel than they do on a match ticket; fans travelling by train spend the most followed by lone drivers (most fans share lifts to games), with those travelling by bus spending the least; the average fan spends £55 on a match day with £13 going on travel, while train travellers spend £74, with £26 of this spent getting to the game.</p><p></p><p>Malcolm Clark, chair of the Football Supporters' Federation said: \"Football's loyal supporters deserve more help to leave their cars at home and enjoy the day without hassle.</p><p></p><p>\"Making matchday travel more convenient, pleasant and affordable would benefit everyone involved in football, and we hope to see these ideas employed more widely in future.\"</p>","headline":"Newcastle United tops survey of matchday travel among football fans","trailText":"North-east club clear champions in provision of transport options while Manchester United

It was Tuesday, the day before the Bundesliga leaders took on Arsenal, but he was talking as if it was a <em>fait accompli</em> and, in hindsight, tempting fate more than he realised. \"It is a surprise to have no English teams in the quarter-finals,\" he said. \"They have a strong league and have gone far in the past, so it's a big surprise.\"</p><p>What happened the following night very nearly caught him out. Jens Lehmann summed it up when he talked of the \"arrogance\" in Germany approaching the match. It was, he explained, not considered an important game. \"In their minds, they are already through.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Lahm was right, even if the occasion did threaten to become an ordeal for the four-time winners. Arsenal came up short, while Manchester United will be another envious onlooker when the draw is made, and Manchester City and Chelsea have been excluded since the group phase. It is the first time since Blackburn Rovers in 1995-96 – when only the champions qualified for the tournament – that the Premier League has not had a side in the last eight.</p><p>Plainly, it represents decline, or at least evidence of decline, bearing in mind that in the last eight finals, the Premier League has provided eight representatives, three winners and one all-English affair. Whether that decline amounts to complacency, or a crisis in the making, is another matter entirely, bearing in mind it's only 10 months since Chelsea were parading the trophy through west London – and, certainly, there are plenty of serious football people who consider it too early for snap judgements.</p><p>Roberto Mancini talked recently of English football being considerably superior to its Italian counterpart. Rafael Benítez believes it is \"not an issue\" and \"the wheel will turn again.\" Jose Mourinho says the same. Sir Alex Ferguson will forever be convinced United would have made it past Real Madrid were it not for a red-card decision.</p><p>Arsène Wenger, however, is not usually one for alarmist statements, so it is worth listening when he says it represents \"a massive wake-up call\". England have had 33 quarter-finalists since 1996, compared to Spain's 32, Italy's 24,  Germany's 20 and France's 11, so not to have a single representative this year deserves scrutiny, at the very least.</p><p>Wenger's conclusion is that \"the rest of Europe has caught back up with us\" and he may have a point, bearing in mind the four English teams won only 39% of their games – again, their worst statistic since Blackburn 17 years ago.</p><p>Between them, they managed considerably fewer shots at goal, 269, than their opponents, 345. City had 56 compared to 92. Arsenal's figures were 48 against 93. The four teams conceded more goals per game, 1.39, than any season since 1998-99. Put it all together, and it clearly raises questions about whether the Premier League is quite as accomplished as it likes to portray itself.</p><p>A better time, perhaps, to assess that accurately will be in the next couple of years, when we will know whether this season was simply a one-off or part of a more serious downward trend. Yet it is not knee-jerk to wonder if there are areas of English football that are deteriorating, or at least need fine-tuning.</p><p>Defending, as a whole, has been pretty poor in the Premier League this season. The standard of goalkeeping has regressed (just try to name three goalkeepers who have consistently excelled). Of last season's top four, Arsenal, Chelsea and City have all slipped backward to some degree.</p><p>Other issues have to be factored in. English teams would clearly be refreshed by a winter break, but the top managers have all but given up on calling for it. In Spain, they will rearrange the fixture schedule to help their teams succeed in Europe. In England, that is unheard of. Then there is the speed at which the Premier League is played – 20% faster than five years ago, according to Prozone – when playing in Europe tends to require greater control and discipline and is generally a different tempo, quick bursts of incisive passing, but more structured and conservative beforehand.</p><p>City are the case in point, with only three wins in 12 attempts in the Champions League over the past two seasons. Two were against a Villarreal side that would eventually be relegated, the other against a Bayern team that had already qualified and fielded a virtual reserve team. This season there were no wins in six, albeit in a treacherous group involving the champions of Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>All the same, it is probably too early to make rushed judgements. Wenger made some valid points without actually identifying what had gone wrong, and it is also worth pointing out Arsenal's manager had argued in November there was no reason to be unduly concerned. \"Maybe we have less room, less margin, than we had before, when it was just a question of when we would qualify. German football has come up, Spanish football is there every year and some French clubs have come back, like Paris Saint-Germain. It looks less obvious for us. But I don't think we are getting worse.\"</p><p>Jupp Heynckes, Bayern's manager, was correct, too, when he said it might not even be a debate but for one of the more contentious refereeing decisions at Old Trafford in recent years. \"For United, what can you say?\" Heynckes said, reflecting on Nani's red card against Madrid. \"They had a referee decision that put them at a great disadvantage. When matches are really tight in the Champions League, you have to start and end with 11 players. A decision like that can completely change a match.\"</p><p>There are other mitigating factors, according to Mourinho. \"Man City are out because the draw had something strange – [Borussia] Dortmund, Real Madrid and Man City,\" Madrid's manager says. \"Chelsea were also in a difficult group (Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk and FC Nordsjaelland).\"</p><p>Mourinho's view is that there is nothing greatly for English football to be concerned about. All four of the Spanish clubs, he points out, were struggling to qualify. \"If the four Spanish teams are out, it doesn't mean that Spanish football is collapsing. It is football, it can happen.\"</p><p>As it turned out, Madrid, Barcelona and Malaga went through, and Spain have three quarter-finalists for the first time in 10 years. England managed that in three successive seasons from 2007 to 2009. Extend that period back to 2005, there was an English finalist in the Champions League every year. Since then, there have been only two English teams to get as far as the semi-finals – Chelsea last season, United the year before.</p><p>\"A lot of teams have caught up,\" Lahm says. \"We are here. Dortmund are here.\" He agrees, however, with Heynkes about what happened to United against Madrid. \"They didn't have any luck in the draw. And they had only 10 players on the pitch. It could be very different.\"</p><p>Heynckes believes it is evidence that football is cyclical. \"The English teams were strong. Now there are Bundesliga teams. There are always changes. That livens up the Champions League.\"</p><p>Benítez agrees. \"I still see English clubs with a lot of potential who can do really well in Europe. I'm sure the wheel will turn again. Real Madrid and Barcelona are very strong. Italy have had some problems, but Juventus are very strong. To have two or three English teams in the semis or finals is not easy because of the size of the other teams. But I don't see a big problem. It's just one year. The next years may be different.\"</p><p>In the meantime, David Beckham, one suspects, will enjoy being the last Englishman standing. Three sides from Spain, two from Germany and one each from Italy, Turkey and France have made it. The draw is on Friday, when Uefa will map out the route to 25 May at Wembley. English football will have its nose pressed to the window outside.</p><p><em>This article has been amended since first publication</em></p>","headline":"Champions League failure is not a reason for English clubs to panic, yet","trailText":"<strong>Daniel Taylor:</strong> A Premier League club is not in the draw for the last eight for the first time in 17 years, but what does it mean for English football?","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/3/14/1363268144927/Arsenal-Champions-League-003.jpg","wordcount":"1340","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-21T13:43:45Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/mar/14/champions-league-failure-english-clubs","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2013/mar/14/champions-league-failure-english-clubs","tags":[{"id":"football/championsleague","webTitle":"Champions League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/championsleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/500"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.
