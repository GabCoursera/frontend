million miles away, then I don't know what the translation from a mile into a point is,\" the Arsenal manager said. \"Everybody has opinions, people who have managed zero games have opinions and we have to accept that. We are in a society where there are thousands of opinions every day, and some go for you and some go against you. You have to live with that.</p><p>\"We have not given up [on the title], believe me and we can show that on Saturday,\" Wenger added. \"It is our attitude that will decide that.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/david-silva-manchester-city-fitness-arsenal\" title=\"\">Arsenal tackle a rampant Manchester City side on Saturday afternoon</a>, following the disappointment of conceding a late own goal in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/arsenal-swansea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-2 draw against Swansea</a>. \"We have not given up [on the title], believe me and we can show that on Saturday. It is our attitude that will decide that. Champions keep going when everybody else would give up.\"</p><p>Speaking as a television pundit, Scholes had launched a fierce attack on Arsenal under Wenger, claiming they had \"midfield players with no discipline\" and adding that \"there are no leaders\" at the north London club. He also accused Jack Wilshere of failing to reach the \"next level\".</p><p>Wenger, though, insists his squad – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/arsene-wenger-arsenal-aaron-ramsey\" title=\"\">which has been hit by injuries to key men</a> like Theo Walcott, Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey – have what it takes to compete with the best. \"You cannot say that.

Once Jack is back and consistently on the pitch, he will prove everybody wrong – and Scholes knows that as well.</p><p>\"Wilshere needs more time. He works very hard on his rehab and it is a fractured bone so you cannot accelerate that process,\" Wenger said. \"But yes, for the World Cup certainly [he will be back].\"</p><p>Beating Manchester City would boost Arsenal's flagging title hopes but the Gunners are also battling to keep Bacary Sagna from joining Saturday's visitors after news emerged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/manchester-city-offer-bacary-sagna-arsenal-three-year-deal\" title=\"\">City had offered the right-back a lucrative deal</a> to join them in the summer when his contract expires.

I am confident he will stay. No matter what his decision will be, we will accept it and go on with it.\"</p><p>Wenger himself has yet to formally agree to stay on past the summer, but sees no reason for alarm.

Hughes keeps Stoke grounded, John Stones is rock solid for Everton and Liverpool aim for a straight eight","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<h2>1) Hughes brings Stoke down to earth</h2><p>What to make of Mark Hughes's first season at Stoke City? There's certainly been no radical revolution, rather a gradual evolution away from the hoof-ball Tony Pulis served up to such great effect. \"It will take time,\" Hughes said in August. \"On occasions we'll make mistakes but if we want to play in a certain way that's what we have to do.\" And there have been hiccups along the way, but the players have adjusted and are on course for the club's best ever Premier League finish – something the Welshman should be rightfully proud of. Not only is the style of play benefiting from the manager's methods – but the team are also scoring more goals. They already have 36, two more than last season's total, and 10 behind their highest under Pulis in 2010-11. It's an impressive feat given the relative modesty of Hughes's additions to the squad. There's likely to be more money to spend in the summer, and with Premier League survival all but assured the manager can focus on building for next season, with Ivica Olic already in his sights. The veteran Croatian striker is enjoying a strong season at Wolfsburg, and has revealed that he's tempted by a move to English football. \"When I was talking with Hughes, I told him; 'My neck will hurt with your long balls, who on earth is going to catch them all'. He said to me: 'We don't play like that any more, we want to play a European style of football'. That's OK for me but so far I have not yet decided.\" A strong finish and the continued development of that continental style will not only please the fans, but it will go a long way to convincing better players, like Olic, to join the club in the summer – a virtuous circle of tactics and transfers that can lift Stoke into the top half next season. <strong>TM</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/23/peter-crouch-england-world-cup-mark-hughes-stoke\" title=\"\">Crouch is an World Cup candidate, says Hughes</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/stephen-ireland-dead-granny-roy-keane\" title=\"\">Roy Keane meets Stephen Ireland's 'dead' granny</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>2) Rolling Stones rock solid for Everton</h2><p>Since Phil Jagielka suffered a small tear in his hamstring, John Stones has played every minute of Everton's four consecutive league victories this month, and while the likes of Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku have earned much of the praise for the recent performances, the 19-year-old centre-back, who can also play at right-back, has looked composed and technically assured in Jagielka's absence. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz3H72j8qyE\" title=\"\">Stones has never lacked confidence</a>, but has now grown into his 6ft 2in frame and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/newcastle-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Newcastle on Tuesday</a>, played for much of the game with a bandage around his head, after a brave header left him with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvertonVines/status/448556909009059841\" title=\"\">a deep cut</a> that required 10 stitches – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/efc_mattgamble/status/448589966063726593\" title=\"\">threaded, of course, in Everton blue</a>. Jagielka is expected to be fit for a return at Fulham on Sunday, but with Stones in this form, it is not a foregone conclusion that Roberto Martínez will opt for the 31-year-old. If Stones can keep his place, and put on a similar showing for the rest of the season, who is to say that he cannot play his way into Roy Hodgson's thoughts, particularly with the likes of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling failing to convince at the moment. <strong>MB</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/26/ross-barkley-england-world-cup-everton\" title=\"\">Ross Barkley blossoms in time for World Cup</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/roberto-martinez-everton-rebuild-training-round\" title=\"\">Roberto Martínez sets out rebuilding plans</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>3) Reds on course for straight eight </h2><p>It wasn't so long ago that Tottenham and Liverpool were engaged in the perennially underwhelming battle for fourth place. However, some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/08/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league\" title=\"\">emphatic victories for Brendan Rodgers's side</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/23/noriwch-city-tottenham-premier-league-matchreport\" title=\"\">erratic results</a> after Tim Sherwood's promotion have allowed the Reds to emerge as genuine title contenders and Everton to leapfrog Spurs to chase down Arsenal for the final Champions League place. So with two sides travelling in opposite directions in the league, and Liverpool's imperious record at Anfield it should be no problem for Steven Gerrard and co to record an eighth straight win? Perhaps not. Tottenham have had a clear week to prepare for this game, a novelty in a season inevitably marred by the waste of time that is the Europa League. Meanwhile Liverpool, who have certainly benefitted from no European excursions and early exits from the cups, had a rare midweek game and will have to play their third game in a week for only the eighth time this season. The last time that happened they won the first two, the second to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/12/fulham-liverpool-premier-league-match-repor\" title=\"\">relegation threatened Fulham by a single goal</a>, before facing a tricky opponent from north London. Sound familiar? They <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/16/arsenal-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">lost that third match 2-1</a>. In fact the only time Liverpool have triumphed in three games in the space of a week was back in August, and the middle of that triptych was a home League Cup victory over Notts County. If Rodgers' side are to record an eighth straight league win and keep their noses ahead of Man City they will need to show endurance to go with their attacking panache. <strong>TM</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/tottenham-resigning-steven-caulker-cardiff-summer\" title=\"\">Spurs consider re-signing Steven Caulker</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/25/liverpool-prosper-philosophy-brendan-rodgers-premier-league-title\" title=\"\">Brendan Rodgers' flexible philosophy</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>4) Rémy has no rival in Magpies pecking order </h2><p>Loïc Rémy has scored 43.5% of Newcastle's league goals this campaign, and with the Frenchman currently injured and possibly returning to his parent-club, QPR, in the summer, pressure is building on the rest of the team who have failed to score in nine of the last 13 league games. \"Let's be honest, stats don't lie and you can see that yourself when you look at how many goals the rest of the team have got,\" said Newcastle's assistant manager, John Carver, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/newcastle-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the Magpies' defeat to Everton</a>. \"Moussa [Sissoko] has to chip in, [Yoan] Gouff [ran] has to chip in, Cheicky [Tioté] has to chip in, Vurn [Anita] even – and he almost did, the centre-backs need to get a goal from somewhere.\" Singling players out like this can often dampen confidence but could be an indication that with a summer overhaul pending, some of Newcastle's squad are playing for their futures. Clear of the relegation pack, and with little hope of securing a Europa League place, the north-east club's season already seems to be fizzling out, but with Alan Pardew, who is due to return from his three-game stadium ban at Southampton on Saturday, already talking about potential targets – namely Romelu Lukaku – motivation to perform should not be an issue. <strong>MB </strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/21/newcastle-hatem-ben-arfa-players-discipline\" title=\"\">Players complain about Ben Arfa's lack of discipline</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>5) United weakness a bonus against Villa </h2><p>Poor beleaguered David Moyes. Even Sir Alex Ferguson's champions lost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/08/manchester-united-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">2-1 at home to Manchester City last season</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/23/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">6-1 the year before</a>, so is 3-0 really such a crime in the big scheme of things? Of course, context is everything – and as welcome as the Champions League victory against Olympiakos was, Moyes has done precious little to endear himself to the Old Trafford faithful. A win at home to Aston Villa would be nothing but short-term respite for the Scot – and may not even provide that should the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/manchester-united-plane-message-david-moyes-sacked\" title=\"\">ludicrous fly-by</a> occur. United have a 17-point gap over Villa – so need not be looking over their shoulder, but Paul Lambert's men will still provide a stern test. They've already managed wins against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/17/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league\" title=\"\">Arsenal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/15/aston-villa-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/28/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Manchester City</a> this season, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/18/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a draw at Liverpool</a>, proving that Villa are capable of raising their game against the best in the division. It's against the weaker sides that they've really struggled – so perhaps Moyes will be alright this weekend after all … <strong>TM</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/manchester-united-fans-plane-banner-david-moyes-out\" title=\"\">When fans have taken their views to the skies</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/class-of-1992-salford-city-deal-agreed\" title=\"\">Class of '92 to buy Salford City</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>6) West Bromwich v Cardiff</h2><p>The least a club's board is entitled to expect on appointing a new manager is a bounce in form – even if it is that of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce\" title=\"\">a dead cat</a>. So it must be with some dismay that those who control the purse strings at West Brom and Cardiff respectively have watched the effect their managerial changes have resulted in. Pepe Mel at West Brom has managed one win in eight, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has done marginally better with two from 12 league games – but it's still relegation form for both clubs, who are separated by just three points going into Saturday's game. The fact that West Brom are three points clear of the bottom three despite managing only two victories since the 1-0 defeat by Cardiff which left them two points clear of the drop zone and resulted in Steve Clarke losing his job is remarkable. It almost feels that there's been some kind of mathematical error in calculating the table which is allowing the Baggies to dodge the drop, but in fact it is a damning indictment on the woeful form of the bottom six teams. A draw will do neither team any favours – Sunderland have a game in hand, and will welcome both these two sides to the Stadium of Light before the season ends. This is the perfect game for one of these dead cats to start bouncing – or else they'll soon find themselves scratching around in the Championship. <strong>TM</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/fa-chairman-greg-dyke-jeff-astle-widow-meeting-head-trauma\" title=\"\">FA to talk to Jeff Astle's widow</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>7) Canaries need to keep soaring</h2><p>Norwich gave their chances of survival a massive boost with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/norwich-city-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 win against Sunderland</a> last weekend. But there's no let up from there. Over the next three Saturdays they travel to Swansea, host West Brom and the visit west London to face Fulham. It's a veritable feast of relegation six-pointers – and with 32 points they may need wins from all three. After that the Canaries play Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. If the magic 40-point mark isn't reached before that quadruple of worrisome end of season fixtures Chris Hughton's side will struggle to hit it. The bottom of the table is so tight that fewer points than normal may suffice, but it's a big risk to leave your fate in the hands of others, or rely on taking points from teams involved in the scrap for European places and the title. As the only side in the bottom seven to have kept the faith with their manager, it would be a great shame if the club were rewarded for their admirable stability with relegation. <strong>TM</strong></p><p></p><h2>8) Sagna wages a rearguard action </h2><p>Arsenal host Manchester City this weekend, all too aware that their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/manchester-city-offer-bacary-sagna-arsenal-three-year-deal\" title=\"\">visitors are intent on nabbing Bacary Sagna this summer</a>, with the Frenchman coming to the end of his contract. If Sagna does join City it would be all to easy to label him in the same bracket as Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Touré, Samir Nasri and Gaël Clichy, who all left north London for Manchester between 2009-11. Yet the situation is not the same – the goalposts have shifted at the Emirates, namely the break in wage structure that has occurred since those four players moved north to Manchester. Mesut Özil became the club's record signing and one of their highest ever paid player on around £140,000-a-week last summer, and earlier this month, Aaron Ramsey joined Theo Walcott, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/18/theo-walcott-signs-arsenal-contract\" title=\"\">who signed his contract in January of last year</a>, in earning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/04/aaron-ramsey-new-five-year-arsenal-contract\" title=\"\">over £100,000-a-week</a>. At the time that Nasri, Kolo and co left, nobody had earned that kind of money since Thierry Henry left the club. Sagna has been one of the first names on the team-sheet ever since his arrival at the club, so why shouldn't he want near-parity with the team's other top performers? Wenger must have known he was setting a precedent in the signing of Özil – this appears to be the fallout. One-year extentions for Arsenal players in their 30s have been the norm ever since Dennis Bergkamp entered his fourth decade – but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/04/arsenal-new-contracts-per-mertesacker-tomas-rosicky\" title=\"\">with Tomas Rosicky signing a new deal</a>, that too seems to be a thing of the past. Sagna is Arsenal's first 30-something to hold out for a three-year deal. What would the fans have Wenger do? Stick to the club's principles or choose again to break house rules to avoid losing Sagna on a free transfer to one of their rivals? <strong>MB</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/arsenal-to-play-first-game-in-usa-since-1989\" title=\"\">Arsenal to play first game in US since 1989</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/arsene-wenger-arsenal-aaron-ramsey\" title=\"\">Gunners will not rush Ramsey back into action</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>9) Eagles fans give Palace something to cheer</h2><p>One of the bright spots of this Premier League season has been the Crystal Palace fans. They have made remaining witty, colourful and upbeat while enjoying Tony Pulis's unique brand of football seem easy, and their loss would be felt should they fail to remain clear of the relegation positions by season's end. A visit from Chelsea is sure to have Eagles fans at their vociferous best, and the players will need that support if they're to secure vital points. Palace haven't won a game since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/08/crystal-palace-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">8 February</a>, adding a measly two points to their total since then, despite winnable games against Swansea, Southampton, Sunderland and Newcastle since. It seems the Pulis bounce has been stifled, and while José Mourinho's side certainly don't offer an easy route to Premier League points, Aston Villa and West Brom have both shown in recent weeks that Chelsea are vulnerable against stubborn defences on the road. With Liverpool and Man City also set for a visit to Selhurst Park, Palace fans will have a big say not only on their own teams fate, but also the destination of this year's Premier League title. <strong>TM</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/laurent-blanc-mind-games-jose-mourinho-champions-league\" title=\"\">Laurent Blanc will not play mind games with José Mourinho</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>10) Hammers will find relief on the road after hitting the boos </h2><p>Safely ensconced in mid-table, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/west-ham-hull-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a 2-1 win at home against one of your closest rivals</a> tucked in your back pocket – and yet a chorus of boos rings out as the final whistle blows. Times are hard for Sam Allardyce in east London. It's a strange thing, what more do West Ham fans want? The answer is straightforward: more attractive football, something better than scraping a win against 10 men, a return to the ideals dating back to Ron Greenwood and Bobby Moore. But maybe that's too much to ask. The Hammers are just about where you would expect them to be – 11th place, with a chance of a top-half finish, and that when their main goal threat, and record signing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/05/andy-carroll-training-return-west-ham-injury\" title=\"\">has been sidelined with injury</a> for a large chunk of the season. And the atmosphere certainly isn't helping the players – \"I must admit the anxiety from the stands can spill on to the pitch and get into our minds,\" said born-and-bred Iron Mark Noble. \"When that happens, some players can be affected and they make mistakes that they would not normally make.\" In that regard at least a trip to Sunderland will be a welcome escape for Allardyce's team. The real problem is whether this discontent has any impact in the boardroom. When West Ham were flirting with relegation earlier in the season there was the definite feel that the co-owners Davids Gold and Sullivan would have liked to swing the axe, but were too scared it would jeopardise their Premier League status. They've been proved right – a look at the lack of success enjoyed by those teams that have switched their manager seems to support this – but with the 60,000 seater Olympic Stadium to be filled in a couple of years time the board know that the goodwill of fans and neutrals alike will be crucial. As successful as Allardyce has been in regaining and retaining the top-flight position the club need to develop, it's questionable whether he's the man to have the tourists blowing bubbles from the freshly constructed Stratford stands. <strong>TM</strong></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/west-ham-hull-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">West Ham end three-match losing run </a></blockquote></p>","headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","trailText":"<strong>Toby Moses and Michael Butler:</strong> Mark Hughes keeps Stoke grounded, John Stones is rock solid for Everton and Liverpool aim for a straight eight","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395948815065/ten-things-006.jpg","wordcount":"2599","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-04T08:00:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/28/premier-league-ten-things-this-weekend","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/28/premier-league-ten-things-this-weekend","tags":[{"id":"football/series/ten-things-look-out-weekend","webTitle":"Ten things to look out for this weekend","type":"series","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/ten-things-look-out-weekend","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/series/ten-things-look-out-weekend","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tobymoses","webTitle":"Toby Moses","r2ContributorId":"26730","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Toby Moses works for Observer Sport and writes for the Observer's television guide and Digital Culture</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tobymoses","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/tobymoses","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michael-butler","webTitle":"Michael Butler","r2ContributorId":"53429","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Michael is a freelance writer and subeditor and definitely started supporting Blackburn Rovers before 1994/5, before anyone asks</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-butler","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/michael-butler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433192316","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395948804764/ten-things-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Graphic","altText":"ten things","height":"54","credit":"Graphic","caption":"Clockwise from right: David Moyes has another bad weekend ahead; Newcastle will miss Loïc Rémy; Bacary Sagna faces the team interested in signing him this summer; and John Stones has a chance to push his way into England reckoning.

than 2.7 goals a game have been registered in the past four Premier League seasons and a fifth is a distinct possibility","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>There were 42 goals in the Premier League at the weekend, a bumper crop that, with 16 more in five midweek games, took the average goals per game this season to 2.73. With Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge in devastating form, Manchester City hammering teams all over the place and Fulham shipping hatfuls every week, this has felt like a season of glut.</p><p>It is not, though: 2.73 goals is lower than last season's average of 2.80 goals per game in the Premier League, which in turn was lower than the 2.81 of 2011-12. In fact, if things go on as they are, this will be the lowest scoring season since 2008-09. Still, there does appear to be an overall pattern suggesting more goals are being scored. Between 2000-01 and 2008-09, there were no Premier League seasons in which there was an average of more than 2.7 goals per game. This looks like being the fifth in the row that beats that mark.</p><p>In part it is down to a change in the laws. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/13/the-question-why-is-offside-law-genius\" title=\"\">tweaking of the offside rule</a> has increased the effective playing area, which has allowed the sort of diminutive creative player who might previously have been bullied out of games to return – although the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/01/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league\" title=\"\">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/30/real-madrid-borussia-dormund-champions-league\" title=\"\">Borussia Dortmund</a> swatted aside Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals last season seemed to hint at a return to greater athleticism – combined with high technical ability – at the very highest level.</p><p>Similarly the crackdown on tackling from behind and intimidatory play, a process that has been going on over the past two decades, has encouraged self-expression in central areas.</p><p>Watching <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Arsenal's dismal resistance at the weekend</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/cardiff-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the shambles of Cardiff against Liverpool</a>, the catalogue of mistakes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/23/tottenham-hotspur-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in Tottenham's 3-2 win against Southampton</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/23/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-clasico\" title=\"\">the thrilling chaos of <em>el clásico</em></a>, it is tempting to suggest teams have forgotten how to defend.</p><p>That is something that is very difficult to examine statistically, given good defending often results in nothing happening – think of Peter Shilton saying that he barely touched the ball in some of the best games he had for Nottingham Forest because he had organised his back four so well he did not have to – but because of the increased attacking onus on full-backs and the way that out-and-out defensive midfielders have all but vanished from the game, it is logical that should be the case.</p><p>The decline of the defensive midfielder – where are our David Battys, our Claude Makélélés, our Frankie van der Elsts of yesteryear? – seems particularly marked this season. Barcelona pioneered the trend, using their real holder, Javier Mascherano, as a central defender.  Bayern off-loaded Luiz Gustavo and now field a passer – Philipp Lahm, Javier Martínez or Thiago Alcântara – in the role. Bayern and Barça, though, defend primarily by keeping the ball; possession for them becomes a proactive means of goal prevention. For teams who are less good at dominating the ball, the wisdom of gambling with a ballplayer rather than a ball-winner is less clear.</p><p>Arsenal, for reasons best known to Arsène Wenger, having acquired a true midfield battler in Mathieu Flamini, have stopped playing him in key games (Arsenal in Premier League games in which Flamini has played more than 45 minutes this season: W12 D 2 L 1; in which he has not: W7 D4 L5). City loaned out Gareth Barry, leaving an occasionally uneasy partnership at the back of midfield between Yaya Touré and Fernandinho. Liverpool have Lucas Leiva fit again but tend to play Steven Gerrard in the deep role, enhancing the quality of long passes out from the back but at the expense of cover for the back four.</p><p>Only two teams in the Premier League stand aloof from the trend.</p><p>Chelsea, eschewing the high defensive line of the majority of Europe's elite, have thrived since José Mourinho, in the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/sunderland-chelsea-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">Capital One Cup defeat by Sunderland</a>, decided to revert to his preferred reactive approach.</p><p>Since then – bolstered by the arrival of Nemanja Matic, a true defensive midfielder who also happens to be able to pass (as opposed to passer who can do a bit of covering) – Chelsea have conceded only five times in 15 league games.</p><p>The other Premier League side who have proved that defending is possible within the modern laws is Crystal Palace. In the first 12 games of the season, Palace conceded 21 goals; in the 18 since Tony Pulis has taken over they have let in 18 (a process that began with Keith Millen, under whose caretaker charge Palace conceded four in four).</p><p>The problem is that in those 18 games Palace have scored only 12, the defensive resolve perhaps coming at the expensive of attacking flair (although given they scored only seven in the first 12 games, it seems fair to say there was not a huge amount of flair to begin with).</p><p>The vast majority of other sides, though, have followed the pattern started in 2009. The example of Blackpool – who, although they were ultimately relegated, showed it was possible to compete with attacking football – has perhaps encouraged teams nearer the bottom not simply to sit back and look to soak up pressure. Blackpool went down in 2010-11, since when relegated teams have averaged 43.22 goals per season; in the five seasons before that the figure was 34.07.</p><p>The Blackpool paradigm, coming two years after the step up in average goals per game, did not begin the trend but it does perhaps sustain it.</p><p>Sides from top to bottom, it appears, have opted for a balance that favours attacking.</p>","headline":"The Question: have football teams lost the art of defending?","trailText":"<strong>Jonathan Wilson: </strong>More than 2.7 goals a game have been registered in the past four Premier League seasons and a fifth is a distinct possibility","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395915430399/Chelsea-v-Arsenal-008.jpg","wordcount":"931","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-03T09:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/27/the-question-lost-art-of-defending-football-tactics-premier-league","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/27/the-question-lost-art-of-defending-football-tactics-premier-league","tags":[{"id":"football/football-tactics","webTitle":"Football tactics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football-tactics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football-tactics","references":[]},{"id":"sport/series/the-question","webTitle":"The Question","type":"series","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/the-question","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/series/the-question","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jonathanwilson","webTitle":"Jonathan Wilson","rcsId":"GNL517953","r2ContributorId":"15910","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/11/27/Untitled-2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Wilson writes regularly about Eastern European football and tactics.

We will see how that turns out. The UK is a place we'd like to continue to invest\".</p><p></p><p>Zaslav was more open about the potential for Discovery to enter the next three-year Premier League TV rights deal, which is expected to start later this year, as part of a strategy to boost Eurosport in the 55 markets it broadcasts.</p><p></p><p>\"Eurosport is a bigger platform than ESPN on cable in the US and it reaches more people,\" he said, speaking at the FT Digital Media conference in London on Thursday. \"The question is what we do about that. If we look at big sports rights will be careful about it, we are going to be thoughtful about it.\"</p><p></p><p>In January Discovery Communications fast-tracked a deal to increase its stake in Eurosport from 20% to 51%, with Zaslav expanding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/24/eurosport-owner-discovery-premier-league-tv-rights\" title=\"\">on comments made in January</a> about entering the process by indicating that a joint bid might be an option to spread the multi-billion pound cost.</p><p>\"We have had a lot of conversations with a lot of players in local markets looking for partners as sports rights come up,\" he said. \"We will be be keen to look at what is available. We are cogniscent of the fact that this is a great brand … that could really emerge as premier sports brand here in UK and Western and Eastern Europe\".</p><p></p><p>The idea of a potential joint bid opens up an intriguing range of possibilities, not least of which could be the potential to join forces with Virgin Media to snatch the TV rights.</p><p></p><p>John Malone, the chairman of Virgin Media's parent company Liberty Global, is one of the largest shareholders in Discovery Communications. Malone, chief executive of Discovery from 2005 until 2008 when the company was taken public in the US, holds a stake which gives him almost 30% of the voting power.</p><p></p><p>Another option could be to partner with BSkyB, which is desperate to see off direct rival BT in the next football rights auction, with whom Discovery already has a strong commercial relationship.</p><p></p><p>BSkyB already has a potential back-end TV ad sales deal lined up with Discovery to soak up Channel 5's ad sales operation if the US cable giant triumphs in the bidding battle for the broadcaster.</p><p></p><p>Discovery is already BSkyB's  second biggest TV ad sales partner – after MTV owner Viacom, another Channel 5 bidder – in a deal which runs until 2016.</p><p></p><p>Zaslav warned that at this point he has by no means made a decision on whether to pursue big ticket sports rights, such as the Premier League or Champions League.</p><p></p><p>\"Most of what's on Eurosport is locked in for next several years – tennis, winter sports and cycling – we have the core sports,\" he said. \"We have a real advantage keeping the costs of second level sports manageable. The question is do we go up a level. In some cases taking a big swing might make sense to do in a joint bidding. In some cases might make sense to leave bigger high end sports to big broadcasters.

Needless to say, the cabin crew have the Irn-Bru on ice, and are ready to hand out copies of <a href=\"https://www.neillennon.com/product/the-official-neil-lennon-calendar/\">Lennon's official 2014 calendar</a> to all passengers.<br></p><p>South of the border, we'll be dealing with West Ham v Hull, who are both loitering above the relegation pack. The Hammers have lost three on the bounce, with Sam Allardyce's team scoring just once all month, despite his likely front three of Carroll, Downing and Jarvis costing around £31m. If you'd prefer to follow a strike partnership that cost £34m in Suarez and Sturridge, you can do so here live: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/liverpool-sunderland-live-premier-league-report\">Scott Murray is piloting Liverpool v Sunderland</a>. <br></p><p>But don't go, because we've got the dearest of the lot – strike partnerships that cost gazillions (and terrible defences to boot!) – with scorching hot La Liga action: Barcelona v Celta Vigo, Atlético Madrid v Grenada and Sevilla v Real Madrid. After Sunday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/24/barcelona-real-madrid-clasico-of-the-century\">'Clásico of the century'</a>, it's the closest La Liga title race in 21 years, with one point separating the top three – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball/table\">Atlético top of the pile due to their head-to-head record</a>. Keep a special eye out for the Real game, Sevilla have won their last five in the league and could easily throw another spanner in the direction of Carlo and co. </p><p>For the rest of tonight's games, follow the live scores <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">here</a>.

At this stage, and given the marker laid down by Manchester City at Old Trafford 24 hours earlier, that is what matters. The test of Anfield's collective heart rate has commenced.</p><p>Sunderland were obstinate opponents and it was to their credit, rather than Liverpool's fault, that the free-flowing, free-scoring form of Luis Suárez, Daniel Sturridge and co was often contained. Not even Brendan Rodgers's team can swat everyone aside with ease. The visitors almost changed fortunes at both ends of the table when Ki Sung-yueng scored with a 76th-minute header and John O'Shea rose to meet Adam Johnson's free-kick with seconds remaining. A title challenge flashed before Anfield's eyes. The ball flashed across goal and Liverpool held out.</p><p>The merits of Liverpool's seventh successive league win were not in dispute. An emphatic free-kick from Steven Gerrard and the 20th Premier League goal of the season for Daniel Sturridge established a deserved lead that, at 2-0, promised more. Sunderland responded well and the belated introduction of Ki and Johnson spread anxiety throughout the Anfield ranks. \"Liverpool were tense, their fans were tense,\" Gus Poyet said. It is a feeling Liverpool may have to become accustomed to over the final seven games of the season.</p><p>\"It is about reinforcing the need for calmness,\" was Rodgers's take on dealing with title pressure. \"We reinforce to the players the message about dominating the ball. We were the dominant team but no matter how dominant you are when it gets to 2-1 it is going to be tight for that last 10 minutes or so. Our idea is to stay calm under pressure and it is important they can think clearly under pressure. It always gets hairy when it gets to 2-1 and it means so much to you.</p><p>\"For us there is not the expectancy this year. I think people looked at us and thought we would tail off. The pressure is on City with the squad they have and the money they've spent and on Chelsea given how dominant they have been for a number of years. The pressure we have is for ourselves, because we are Liverpool and we want to be winners. We are on that path.\"</p><p>Gerrard sent Liverpool en route to second place in the table just as their struggle with the final ball and in front of Sunderland's 3-4-1-2 formation was beginning to spread unease around Anfield. The contest was brought to life by the first penetrating pass of the match when Philippe Coutinho dispossessed Lee Cattermole and split the visitors' rearguard with a precision ball into Suárez. The Liverpool striker sensed danger the moment Coutinho won possession and was clear of O'Shea and Santiago Vergini as the Brazilian's pass arrived, only to be sent sprawling by the Argentina defender's outstretched leg.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433136001'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395869008974/Daniel-Sturridge-scores-L-009.jpg' alt='Daniel Sturridge scores Liverpool's second goal' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Daniel Sturridge fires Liverpool's second goal past Sunderland's Wes Brown at Anfield. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</figcaption></figure><p>With no obvious covering defender – Wes Brown was catching up with play when the foul was committed – a straight red seemed inevitable. The referee, Kevin Friend, showed only yellow but Anfield's anger evaporated when Gerrard drilled the free-kick beyond a non-existent wall and into the top corner from 20 yards. \"No more free-kicks for you,\" he told Suárez amid the celebrations. Oblivious to one reprieve, Vergini invited a second yellow card with a lazy trip on Suárez shortly afterwards. Again Friend proved to be just that for the Sunderland defender.<br /><br />More of the same but with greater purpose in attack may have been the gist of Poyet's half-time message but it was undermined three minutes after the restart when Sturridge struck. The Liverpool striker was afforded far too much space on the corner of the Sunderland area by Andrea Dossena as he collected Jordan Henderson's pass. Sturridge was even shown inside on to his left foot by the former Anfield defender and obliged with a shot that deflected off Brown and left Vito Mannone rooted to the spot.</p><p>The England international has scored 30 league goals for Liverpool in 37 games, reaching the total quicker than any player in the club's illustrious history for the past 118 years. George Allan, in 1896, got there in fewer games. In the process, Sturridge joined the 28-goal Suárez in passing the 20 mark , the first time two players have reached that target in the same season since the title-winning campaign of 1963-64. Ian St John and Roger Hunt were the last pair to score over 20 for Liverpool, a remarkable wait considering what Ian Rush and Kenny Dalglish, John Aldridge, John Barnes and Peter Beardsley achieved at Anfield.</p><p>Sunderland did not go quietly. Cattermole struck the bar from Johnson's lay-off, so too Sturridge at the opposite end, before Johnson's corner bounced through the Liverpool goalmouth and Ki scored with a diving header at the back post. Apprehension mounted but Liverpool's title pursuit could not be derailed.</p>","headline":"Liverpool flying high after Steven Gerrard inspires win over Sunderland","trailText":"<p>Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge fired Liverpool back to second in the table with a 2-1 win and left plucky Sunderland stuck in the relegation mire</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395869002446/Daniel-Sturridge-scores-L-004.jpg","wordcount":"820","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T22:04:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/liverpool-sunderland-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/26/liverpool-sunderland-premier-league-match-report","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/liverpool","webTitle":"Liverpool","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/liverpool","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"}]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andyhunter","webTitle":"Andy Hunter","r2ContributorId":"22565","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/7/26/1280168367302/Andy-Hunter-002.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andy Hunter is a football correspondent for the Guardian based in Liverpool</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andyhunter","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/andyhunter","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/9"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433136002","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395869002446/Daniel-Sturridge-scores-L-004.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Peter Byrne","altText":"Daniel Sturridge scores Liverpool's second goal","height":"84","credit":"Peter Byrne/PA","caption":"Daniel Sturridge fires Liverpool's second goal past Sunderland's Wes Brown at Anfield.

Ham United 2-1 Hull City | Premier League match report","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-26T22:03:25Z","sectionName":"Football","sectionId":"football","id":"football/2014/mar/26/west-ham-hull-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nqeq","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>This result should have offered West Ham United respite, a win that ended the team's recent Premier League slump and propelled them back towards the deceptive security of mid-table, and yet the final whistle  on Wednesday night still drew a chorus of boos from the home fans. Even in victory, there is dissatisfaction. Sam Allardyce cupped his hand to his ear at the sound, his smile betraying incredulity at the reaction.</p><p>The victory against 10 men came through a penalty that Hull rightly disputed and which resulted in their goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, being sent off and a timely own goal from the Hull defender James Chester just as fear was starting to grip the home players yet again.</p><p>Allardyce, who had just endured his first three-game losing run since arriving at Upton Park, argued it was a time for pragmatism. This victory took West Ham nine points clear of 18th-placed Sunderland, whom they visit on Monday, yet such a chasm seems remarkable given the way this team spluttered as they did for long periods here, their football lacking guile and purpose even if the manager said they were \"absolutely magnificent\".</p><p>The crowd railed at every sideways or backward pass, perplexed as to why opponents who had been reduced in number midway through the first half could not be overwhelmed. \"I couldn't quite believe the booing,\" said Allardyce. \"I started in the game at 16, got into the first-team at 18 and I'm 59 now, and I have never been in a place where we have won and got booed. I can't understand it. Yes, we wanted to play better and score more goals against 10 men. Everyone expects you to. But look what we did with 10 winning against Cardiff and Swansea. You can't assume you'll win 3-0. I'd urge the fans to stay behind their team because it'll affect the players otherwise. It must be the frustration.\"</p><p>Hull, too, had reason to be exasperated. They disputed McGregor's dismissal, arguing West Ham had committed an offence in the build-up to the penalty award and pointing to a covering defender. Mark Noble had darted through the centre and his pass ricocheted off Chester and Tom Huddlestone before the ball reached the marauding Mohamed Diamé in front of goal, the Senegalese controlling it with his arm as he careered forward and poked his shot over the advancing goalkeeper.</p><p>While the attempt was scrambled from the goalline, the referee, Mike Dean, blew for the penalty once he had noticed that both McGregor and Diamé were lying on the turf. \"First of all it's a blatant handball,\" said Steve Bruce. \"[Dean] told me at half-time he'd made the decision himself. Nobody else. When you look at him, though, he doesn't make the decision at all. He turns back 10 seconds later and sees the players lying in a heap, and then awards the penalty.</p><p>\"So if he's reacting retrospectively because someone is injured, how can he be sure about it? And we must have had someone level because we've cleared the ball off the line, so was he really denying a goalscoring opportunity?\"</p><p>McGregor was dismissed as he groggily got to his feet and he spent the night in hospital having suffered an injury that may well end his season. \"He's in a bad way, kidney damage,\" said Bruce. \"A specialist is on his way to see him, a contusion on his kidney. We're hoping it's not ruptured.\"</p><p>That was sobering. Noble scored the penalty, though West Ham showed little fluency thereafter, with Hull thrusting themselves back into the contest. Maynor Figueroa had threatened an equaliser with one powerful effort from distance which was turned aside by Adrián, before  Huddlestone's free-kick deflected off Nikica Jelavic and beyond the goalkeeper to level.</p><p>For a while the mutinous crowd teetered on open revolt, only for Hull to surrender the initiative. Guy Demel was free to cut inside on to his left foot and send over an in-swinging centre which bypassed Kevin Nolan on the edge of the six-yard but drew an instinctive swing of the leg from Chester, the ball cannoning off the Hull centre-half's knee past Steve Harper, sent on for Alex Bruce after McGregor's departure.</p><p>The defeat was harsh on Bruce's rugged side, who rallied late on even with weary limbs and Adrián had to save well late on to deny Huddlestone a second equaliser for Hull. \"I thought we were absolutely terrific,\" said Bruce. They have still to drop below 13th place since September and, like West Ham, will feel tantalisingly close to safety.</p>","headline":"West Ham end losing run after Hull keeper Allan McGregor is sent off","trailText":"West Ham ended a run of three Premier League defeats on Wednesday with a 2-1 win over Hull City, who had their goalkeeper Allan McGregor sent off for the second time this season","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395866906159/Hulls-injured-goalkeeper--004.jpg","wordcount":"751","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T22:03:25Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/26/west-ham-hull-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/26/west-ham-hull-premier-league-match-report","tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/westhamunited","webTitle":"West Ham United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/westhamunited","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/43"}]},{"id":"football/hullcity","webTitle":"Hull City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/hullcity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/26"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/dominicfifield","webTitle":"Dominic Fifield","rcsId":"GNL004637","r2ContributorId":"15597","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381399399489/Dominic-Fifield-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dominic Fifield is the Guardian's London <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">football</a> correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominicfifield","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/dominicfifield","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/26"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/43"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433079719","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395866900324/Hulls-injured-goalkeeper--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Julian Finney","altText":"Hull's injured goalkeeper Allan McGregor is escorted from the field after being sent off.","height":"54","credit":"Julian Finney/Getty Images","caption":"Hull's injured goalkeeper Allan McGregor is escorted from the field after being sent off.

He looks to be OK, though, <i>writes Dr Murray, who is a quack, </i>because less than 60 seconds later he's bustling around down the left, trying one of his fancy backheels. Unlike at Cardiff, this one doesn't come off.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5333355ce4b053cc1d015c5b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T20:16:36.595Z\">8.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>15 min: </b>Sturridge slips a ball down the inside-right channel to release Johnson into the Sunderland area.

Sunderland have visited Anfield 12 times in the Premier League era, and have come away with a point on six occasions. They may have lost heavily here last season, 3-0, but their two previous visits were draws, 1-1 in August 2011, 2-2 in September 2010. Sunderland also have a couple of recent wins under their belts at the Stadium of Light, courtesy of N Bendtner in 2012, and B Ball in 2009. In summary: Liverpool don't always like it when the Black Cats cross their path. The form guide says it should be a shoo-in.

United have 51 points compared with 74 at the same time last year. They have never previously had fewer than 60 at this stage. Old Trafford has mutated from the fortress opponents hoped to escape from with only a minor beating to a destination most desirable. Under Moyes, United have fewer home points (21) than Norwich City and Hull City, with their count of 18 goals the same as Fulham and Cardiff City, who prop up the table.</p><p>The unwanted statistics (and broken records) keep coming. The capitulation to City meant six home league defeats, which has not happened since the 2001-02 season, and the first time the club from across town had recorded three consecutive league wins over United in more than 40 years. It also marked the first time the champions have lost 10 games in a season in the Premier League era. West Bromwich Albion had not won at Old Trafford since 1978 before September's 2-1 victory, a sequence-breaker followed by Everton's 1-0 triumph there in December (this had not happened since 1992), which came before Newcastle ended 41 years without a win on United's patch the same month.</p><p>To be a top-line team and have one awful performance during a season is hardly news. To have three in quick succession is way past unfortunate. Reverses to Olympiakos, Liverpool and City have shone a light on the inadequacies of the Moyes project, with the chief concern that in late March of his debut year there is no sign of improvement.</p><p>The reverse is true. United are speeding backwards at a rate of knots. Going down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/25/olympiakos-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 at Olympiakos</a>, the Champions League last-16's easiest opponents, then 3-0 and 3-0 to United's closest rivals at home has brought Moyes to the point where his job expectancy is discussed in game-to-game terms.</p><p>The United buzzwords of stability and longevity symbolised by the six-year contract handed to the 50-year-old were forgotten on Tuesday as the thus-far loyal fans snapped and Ferguson was abused for anointing Moyes his successor.</p><p>This was the scene after Ferguson sat in the directors' box and witnessed Edin Dzeko needing 43 seconds to start a rout that could have been more painful.</p><p>A further strike from Dzeko before Yaya Touré completed United's misery at the close had members of the faithful using industrial language to ask Ferguson why, precisely, he had decided Moyes was the man to take over.</p><p>The mood inside Old Trafford turned from defiant stoicism to open anger. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/19/manchester-united-olympiakos-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">The lift given by the 3-0 win that overturned Olympiakos's advantage</a> and took United into a Champions League quarter-final with the holders, Bayern Munich, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/west-ham-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Saturday's 2-0 victory at West Ham United</a> evaporated in the seconds City took to cruise forward and establish a 1-0 lead.</p><p>The sense is that the defeat to Manuel Pellegrini's team may prove fatal. One popular theory was that as long as Moyes retained the backing of the hardcore supporters he would survive.</p><p>Understanding this, he has continually praised their unwavering support despite the shocking home form – Swansea City beat United at Old Trafford in the FA Cup – and the taking of only five points from the big four of Arsenal, Chelsea, City and Liverpool, before Pellegrini's side arrived.</p><p>In the United programme for the 167th derby Moyes moved to shore up his core constituency. Yet it read more like a plea for them not to turn on him and to the owners, the Glazers, to remember the mantra about managerial longevity.</p><p>Moyes wrote: \"Our thoughts are well and truly on the future and our planning is already well under way, not just for next season, but for many seasons to come. During Manchester United's long periods of dominance in the last two decades, which brought unparalleled success, many other clubs had to undergo periods of turnaround and they knew tough times when things were not going well for them. They looked to change lots of different managers and players, all the while trying to find ways of keeping up and competing with United.\"</p><p>The first public display of disquiet was the fans catching up with the mood inside the club, where the hierarchy were first taken aback by the abject showing in Athens. The performance of Moyes's side that evening at the Karaiskakis Stadium was so incongruous that to find a precedent was difficult.</p><p>That the defeat to City was the tipping point regarding Moyes for some Old Trafford regulars is recognised within the boardroom as understandable, especially following the defeat to Liverpool.</p><p>Publicly United continue to back the manager. Yet another dismal outing when Aston Villa visit on Saturday lunchtime would further cast Moyes as a moribund man walking towards what could prove the final reckoning – the meeting with Bayern on 1 April.</p><p>The Glazers and their man on the ground, Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, have shown admirable patience. Once this goes expect Moyes's removal to happen quickly and ruthlessly.</p>","headline":"Fans' revolt leaves David Moyes dead man walking at Manchester United","trailText":"<strong>Jamie

In the morning he had become the highest-profile footballer to announce he is gay, and in the hours afterwards he had not checked the public reaction. When I speak to him I tell him that support has been flooding in from fans, fellow footballers, well-wishers – and yes, even Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband.</p><p>\"But where's David Cameron?\" the former Germany international asks with playful indignation. \"He's a Villa supporter, after all!\" The prime minister, as it turns out, would soon add his voice to a raft of high-profile well-wishers that included Angela Merkel, the German national team manager Joachim Löw, and the former German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle, who is also gay.</p><p>They all talked about the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder's \"courage\" in breaking one of sport's last great taboos: Hitzlsperger, capped 52 times by his country, is the first German footballer to reveal he is gay. He is also the first former Premier League footballer to do so.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426663313'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218698171/Thomas-Hitzlsperger-in-hi-001.jpg' alt='Thomas Hitzlsperger in his Everton days' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Thomas Hitzlsperger in his Everton days. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</figcaption></figure><p>It was a moment he always knew would come, and one he dreaded. The decision to address this issue publicly was a \"hard, difficult one\" that took a number of years to gestate, he tells me. The 31-year-old, who retired from the game last year because of injuries, first told his friends and family.</p><p>\"I was surprised and happy that they were all totally OK with it. Where I come from, in rural Bavaria, homosexuality is considered 'un-normal'. I knew that there would be negative reactions from those who will never understand it, also towards my family, but that didn't bother them. I've had nothing but total support from them.\"</p><p>Hitzlsperger, who was engaged to his childhood sweetheart and broke up with her shortly before the scheduled wedding six years ago, was not certain of his sexual orientation until his career was almost over. \"I finally figured out that I preferred living with a man,\" he says.</p><p>He had thought about coming out while still playing for Wolfsburg in 2011-12 but then listened to people who warned him of the negative consequences. \"They all said 'don't do it, a big wave will crash on you',\" he says. \"But in the end I realised that nobody knows. There was no precedent, so everybody could only speculate on what would happen.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426663314'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218865897/Hitzlsperger-in-action-fo-004.jpg' alt='Hitzlsperger in action for Germany in one of his 52 appearances for his national side' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hitzlsperger in action for Germany in one of his 52 appearances for his national side. Photograph: Peter Kneffel/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>While Germany as a country has noticeably become more and more relaxed about homosexuality in recent years, he had also noted there was an unhelpful media obsession with finding the first gay footballer. All sorts of well-intended but ultimately unhelpful interventions from heterosexual players – who either opined that gay players would benefit from coming out or cautioned against it – did not exactly fill him with confidence that this was indeed the right step.</p><p>Homosexuality was rarely a big topic in any of the dressing rooms he encountered, he says, and \"the subject only came up when people were speculating about someone else's sexuality, but never in their presence.\"</p><p>There was the odd incidence of crass homophobia, as well, \"but that was just your general, non-specific football talk,\" says Hitzlsperger. \"I too, used derogatory terms like 'what a gay pass' without thinking about it when I was younger.\"</p><p>The former international, who played in the 2006 World Cup and the 2008 European Championship, maintains that he did not have to lie about his sexuality and that team-mates eventually stopped asking about his lack of a girlfriend.</p><p>In any case, he says, an ultimately fruitless battle to regain full fitness after a series of operations was more important to him than telling his colleagues about his sexual orientation.</p><p>The announcement of his retirement last September brought more time to think, however. \"It really helped me to see that other professional sports people were acknowledging their sexuality. I read about John Amaechi, Gareth Thomas and Tom Daley. They weren't footballers but the fact that they went public gave me the feeling that I was not alone. I began to think that I could help other footballers who might be in the same shoes, so that they could see that here's someone who was even an international. I wanted to encourage them, the way that those guys and Robbie Rogers encouraged me.\"</p><p>He closely studied the fall-out of their coming outs, too, he says, and felt empowered. \"They all said it was good for them.\" Hitzlsperger is unwilling to make wide-scale recommendations – \"everyone has to decide for themselves\" – and is unwilling to predict when the first active footballer in a European top league will follow his lead.</p><p>\"But the important thing for me is to show that being homosexual and professional football player is something that is normal. The perceived contradiction between playing football, the man's game, and being homosexual is nonsense. I don't think anyone has ever come away from watching a game with me thinking there's something wrong or 'too soft' with my game,\" he adds, with a chuckle.</p><p>Known as \"the Hammer\" among supporters because of his fierce shot with his left foot, Hitzlsperger always enjoyed a robust challenge.</p><p>\"You hear the word courage a lot,\" he says, when the talk  returns to the reactions he has experienced so far. \"That's nice to hear, but it's part of the problem, of course. That's something that should change. I sincerely hope that we'll see the when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances anymore, because it will be seen as totally normal that a sports person will speak about his homosexuality, the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends. It won't be easy for the next person to be the truly the first in that regard but maybe I've been able to help them a tiny bit.\"</p><p>Hitzlsperger, who has addressed issues such as racism and antisemitism in German football before, is acutely aware that there is a political dimension to his move, with the Olympic Games in Sochi about to begin. \"It's important to face up to nations that discriminate against minorities, sexual or otherwise,\" he says. \"I'm fine with the fact that my story will be mentioned in relation to the Games, because the situation in Russia is something that needs to be talked about. I'm curious to see what will happen. I'm sure that some athletes will make a stand\".</p><p>Hitzlsperger is under no illusion that football's attitudes will change overnight. On the day of his interview with the Guardian, the Paris St-Germain defender Alex, a former Chelsea player, insisted that \"god created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Yves\".</p><p>Hitzlsperger says: \"You'll always have those guys, but it's sad that they don't think a little deeper about what they're saying. I feel sorry for them, really\".</p><p>Still, the emphatically positive response by politicians, footballers and fans have left him in an optimistic mood and at ease with himself. \"It's good to know, not just for me but for others who are still playing now, that those at the top have no problem, that they support you. When the chancellor comes out in your favour, you know that it's safe being homosexual in this country, that you won't be discriminated. There will always be a small minority who think otherwise but hopefully, their numbers become fewer and fewer over the next years\".</p>","headline":"Thomas Hitzlsperger: 'I finally figured out that I preferred living with a man'","trailText":"<p>Former Premier League footballer and German international talks to <strong>Raphael Honigstein</strong> about how he wanted to tell the world he was gay while he was still playing in Germany for Wolfsburg, but was advised against it</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389218560158/Thomas-Hitzlsperger-005.jpg","wordcount":"1204","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-11T22:09:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/08/thomas-hitzlsperger-gay-footballer-interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/jan/08/thomas-hitzlsperger-gay-footballer-interview","tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"football/bundesligafootball","webTitle":"Bundesliga","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/bundesligafootball","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/625"}]},{"id":"football/europeanfootball","webTitle":"European club football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/europeanfootball","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/europeanfootball","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"world/gay-rights","webTitle":"Gay rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/gay-rights","references":[]},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/society/sexuality","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/raphaelhonigstein","webTitle":"Raphael Honigstein","r2ContributorId":"19394","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/honigstein.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Raphael Honigstein is guardian.co.uk's German football correspondent.

Bale set to be first €100m player after Spurs-Real Madrid switch","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-26T20:40:42Z","sectionName":"Football","sectionId":"football","id":"football/2013/aug/26/garerth-bale-transfer-spurs-real-madrid","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ta9g","standfirst":"World record transfer likely to be confirmed this week as TV fuels European football's spending spree","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>At Real Madrid they have already erected a tented scaffold in one of the stands at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, a small stage upon which they hope the football world will focus later this week. Gareth Bale, the Cardiff boy who made good at Tottenham Hotspur, is set to be unveiled as the world's first €100m (£86m) footballer barring an unlikely counter bid from Manchester United. The Spanish economy may be wheezing in recession, but Real are intent upon bucking the trend.</p><p>Even by Real's standards the fee is staggering, considering this is a player who was almost sold by Tottenham Hotspur for next-to-nothing just four years ago and who has played only one season in Europe's elite competition, the Champions League. It is made more extraordinary because the Welsh international is likely never to feature in a World Cup: the ultimate marketing vehicle for the stars of the game – and their clubs.</p><p>But Real Madrid have been wooed by his recent consistent brilliance at White Hart Lane with the 24-year-old duly named both footballer of the year and young footballer of the year by his fellow professionals in April, having finished last season with 31 goals in all competitions. His move would eclipse the £80m paid by Real to take Ronaldo from Manchester United in 2009.</p><p>Completion of the transfer would be the high water mark of an unprecedented summer of spending across elite European football, as competing oligarchs buoyed by the soaring value of TV deals have lifted spending power across the continent's biggest clubs.</p><p>The Premier League may be about to lose one of its leading lights, but English top flight clubs have still forked out over £460m on players in the current transfer window. That figure will expand further ahead of next Monday's 11pm deadline for deals to be done, and should break the previous record of around £500m, established in 2008, for a single window's business.</p><p>A new £5.5bn television deal guarantees the Premier League's bottom club £63m – more than the champions, Manchester United, earned from the broadcasting pot last season. There is more money pouring into the top division than ever before and that is reflected in transfer fees that are often an expression of power in the game.</p><p>\"Football reflects life, albeit with a ball, so the rich just keep getting richer,\" said Jon Smith, co-founder of the leading First Artist Management agency. \"The rich clubs spend because they can.\"</p><p>Manchester City have spent a little under £100m almost unnoticed. Tottenham, even with Bale on his way out, have broken their own transfer record twice. Chelsea can sign a £30m player, in the Brazilian Willian, almost on a whim. And yet what makes this summer all the more unique is that, where Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, the Glazer family's Manchester United or even City under the Abu Dhabi United group used to splash the cash most extravagantly, alongside Barcelona and Real, now many more clubs across Europe have emerged to join the frenzy.</p><p>French champions Paris St Germain are under Qatari ownership and were able to pay £55m for Edinson Cavani, a Uruguayan forward previously at Napoli who had been courted by English clubs. AS Monaco, bankrolled by the Russian Dmitry Rybolovlev, only returned to the French first division at the end of last season but have spent over €150m in the hope of mustering an immediate title challenge. They beat sides at the top of the Premier League to buy Atlético Madrid's Colombian forward, Radamel Falcao, who cost an eye-catching £53m.</p><p>Germany's Bundesliga, which provided both finalists in last season's Champions League, has also benefitted from its own new broadcasting deal to emerge as a financial and footballing power. Bayern Munich, the reigning European champions, are now under the stewardship of Pep Guardiola – world football's most coveted coach – and were able to entice Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona earlier this summer just as Manchester United were preparing to announce the signing of the midfielder.</p><p>Barcelona took the brilliant Brazil striker Neymar from Santos for €50m to refresh their forward line. If suggestions the Catalan club have already recouped a large proportion of that fee in sales of Neymar's number 11 shirt seem far-fetched, they can at least expect to make a large chunk of that money back in global marketing monies alone. Indeed, all these mind-boggling deals were completed in a summer when Uefa's newly imposed Financial Fair Play rules were supposed to be taking effect, with clubs supposedly restricted to living within their means.</p><p>\"I just hope Uefa make sure it's Financial Fair Play for all, and not just those clubs who have the ability to sell their training ground more than once,\" said Smith.</p><p>That was said with tongue in cheek but reflects the potential loopholes in the Uefa president Michel Platini's plans for regulation. Real's pursuit of Bale has already drawn stinging criticism from the Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</p><p>\"It makes a joke of the FFP regulations,\" he said. \"I find it amazing that in the year the regulations come in, world football has gone completely crazy.\"</p><p>And yet Real consider the £86m arrival of a stellar player a means of reimposing their authority. The president, Florentino Perez, has personally driven the club's galactico culture for high-value players and was anxious to start his fourth term with a bang. An egotist and a populist, Perez is a figure who enjoys the summer months far more than the season itself because he can't control everything that happens out on the pitch. Real, who set the benchmark with the arrivals of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo, are about to establish a new world record fee. Football's spending has never been more lavish.</p><h2>Record signings<br /></h2><p><strong>1893 Willie Groves </strong>West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa

Instead they are regularly \"condemned to a weekly pattern of expensive parking and endless traffic jams.\"</p><p></p><p>The government is urged to take the lead by setting up free public transport with match tickets – along the lines of the popular and well-used KombiTicket in Germany – and individual clubs should routinely publish travel plans that include proposals for new facilities to improve access by walking and cycling as well as clear information about getting to the ground without a car. Transport operators should investigate a national football supporters' railcard with more flexible conditions, the report recommends.</p><p></p><p>Manchester United's Old Trafford ground comes 18th in the survey of 20 Premier League clubs and is described as \"a major ground served mainly by low-capacity public transport, travel planning nearly a decade out of date and without safe walking or cycling routes.\"</p><p></p><p>Bottom of the pile is Reading's Madejski stadium: \"comfortably the least accessible ground in this year's Premier League – out of town and virtually unreachable by regular public transport.\" And languishing at 19th is Queen's Park Rangers' ground, Loftus Road, where \"despite London's extensive public transport, QPR have no coherent travel plan and offer poor information on how to get to Loftus Road</p><p></p><p>Fans of Arsenal, in second place in the survey, make full use of good public transport links at the club's Emirates stadium, where the percentage of fans arriving by car has been reduced from 30% to 10% since moving from their old ground. And in third place, improvements to Fulham's Craven Cottage have led to a high proportion of supporters combining public transport with walking to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Other key findings from the fans' survey include: 23% of fans spend more on travel than they do on a match ticket; fans travelling by train spend the most followed by lone drivers (most fans share lifts to games), with those travelling by bus spending the least; the average fan spends £55 on a match day with £13 going on travel, while train travellers spend £74, with £26 of this spent getting to the game.</p><p></p><p>Malcolm Clark, chair of the Football Supporters' Federation said: \"Football's loyal supporters deserve more help to leave their cars at home and enjoy the day without hassle.</p><p></p><p>\"Making matchday travel more convenient, pleasant and affordable would benefit everyone involved in football, and we hope to see these ideas employed more widely in future.\"</p>","headline":"Newcastle United tops survey of matchday travel among football fans","trailText":"North-east club clear champions in provision of transport options while Manchester United

It was Tuesday, the day before the Bundesliga leaders took on Arsenal, but he was talking as if it was a <em>fait accompli</em> and, in hindsight, tempting fate more than he realised. \"It is a surprise to have no English teams in the quarter-finals,\" he said. \"They have a strong league and have gone far in the past, so it's a big surprise.\"</p><p>What happened the following night very nearly caught him out. Jens Lehmann summed it up when he talked of the \"arrogance\" in Germany approaching the match. It was, he explained, not considered an important game. \"In their minds, they are already through.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Lahm was right, even if the occasion did threaten to become an ordeal for the four-time winners. Arsenal came up short, while Manchester United will be another envious onlooker when the draw is made, and Manchester City and Chelsea have been excluded since the group phase. It is the first time since Blackburn Rovers in 1995-96 – when only the champions qualified for the tournament – that the Premier League has not had a side in the last eight.</p><p>Plainly, it represents decline, or at least evidence of decline, bearing in mind that in the last eight finals, the Premier League has provided eight representatives, three winners and one all-English affair. Whether that decline amounts to complacency, or a crisis in the making, is another matter entirely, bearing in mind it's only 10 months since Chelsea were parading the trophy through west London – and, certainly, there are plenty of serious football people who consider it too early for snap judgements.</p><p>Roberto Mancini talked recently of English football being considerably superior to its Italian counterpart. Rafael Benítez believes it is \"not an issue\" and \"the wheel will turn again.\" Jose Mourinho says the same. Sir Alex Ferguson will forever be convinced United would have made it past Real Madrid were it not for a red-card decision.</p><p>Arsène Wenger, however, is not usually one for alarmist statements, so it is worth listening when he says it represents \"a massive wake-up call\". England have had 33 quarter-finalists since 1996, compared to Spain's 32, Italy's 24,  Germany's 20 and France's 11, so not to have a single representative this year deserves scrutiny, at the very least.</p><p>Wenger's conclusion is that \"the rest of Europe has caught back up with us\" and he may have a point, bearing in mind the four English teams won only 39% of their games – again, their worst statistic since Blackburn 17 years ago.</p><p>Between them, they managed considerably fewer shots at goal, 269, than their opponents, 345. City had 56 compared to 92. Arsenal's figures were 48 against 93. The four teams conceded more goals per game, 1.39, than any season since 1998-99. Put it all together, and it clearly raises questions about whether the Premier League is quite as accomplished as it likes to portray itself.</p><p>A better time, perhaps, to assess that accurately will be in the next couple of years, when we will know whether this season was simply a one-off or part of a more serious downward trend. Yet it is not knee-jerk to wonder if there are areas of English football that are deteriorating, or at least need fine-tuning.</p><p>Defending, as a whole, has been pretty poor in the Premier League this season. The standard of goalkeeping has regressed (just try to name three goalkeepers who have consistently excelled). Of last season's top four, Arsenal, Chelsea and City have all slipped backward to some degree.</p><p>Other issues have to be factored in. English teams would clearly be refreshed by a winter break, but the top managers have all but given up on calling for it. In Spain, they will rearrange the fixture schedule to help their teams succeed in Europe. In England, that is unheard of. Then there is the speed at which the Premier League is played – 20% faster than five years ago, according to Prozone – when playing in Europe tends to require greater control and discipline and is generally a different tempo, quick bursts of incisive passing, but more structured and conservative beforehand.</p><p>City are the case in point, with only three wins in 12 attempts in the Champions League over the past two seasons. Two were against a Villarreal side that would eventually be relegated, the other against a Bayern team that had already qualified and fielded a virtual reserve team. This season there were no wins in six, albeit in a treacherous group involving the champions of Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>All the same, it is probably too early to make rushed judgements. Wenger made some valid points without actually identifying what had gone wrong, and it is also worth pointing out Arsenal's manager had argued in November there was no reason to be unduly concerned. \"Maybe we have less room, less margin, than we had before, when it was just a question of when we would qualify. German football has come up, Spanish football is there every year and some French clubs have come back, like Paris Saint-Germain. It looks less obvious for us. But I don't think we are getting worse.\"</p><p>Jupp Heynckes, Bayern's manager, was correct, too, when he said it might not even be a debate but for one of the more contentious refereeing decisions at Old Trafford in recent years. \"For United, what can you say?\" Heynckes said, reflecting on Nani's red card against Madrid. \"They had a referee decision that put them at a great disadvantage. When matches are really tight in the Champions League, you have to start and end with 11 players. A decision like that can completely change a match.\"</p><p>There are other mitigating factors, according to Mourinho. \"Man City are out because the draw had something strange – [Borussia] Dortmund, Real Madrid and Man City,\" Madrid's manager says. \"Chelsea were also in a difficult group (Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk and FC Nordsjaelland).\"</p><p>Mourinho's view is that there is nothing greatly for English football to be concerned about. All four of the Spanish clubs, he points out, were struggling to qualify. \"If the four Spanish teams are out, it doesn't mean that Spanish football is collapsing. It is football, it can happen.\"</p><p>As it turned out, Madrid, Barcelona and Malaga went through, and Spain have three quarter-finalists for the first time in 10 years. England managed that in three successive seasons from 2007 to 2009. Extend that period back to 2005, there was an English finalist in the Champions League every year. Since then, there have been only two English teams to get as far as the semi-finals – Chelsea last season, United the year before.</p><p>\"A lot of teams have caught up,\" Lahm says. \"We are here. Dortmund are here.\" He agrees, however, with Heynkes about what happened to United against Madrid. \"They didn't have any luck in the draw. And they had only 10 players on the pitch. It could be very different.\"</p><p>Heynckes believes it is evidence that football is cyclical. \"The English teams were strong. Now there are Bundesliga teams. There are always changes. That livens up the Champions League.\"</p><p>Benítez agrees. \"I still see English clubs with a lot of potential who can do really well in Europe. I'm sure the wheel will turn again. Real Madrid and Barcelona are very strong. Italy have had some problems, but Juventus are very strong. To have two or three English teams in the semis or finals is not easy because of the size of the other teams. But I don't see a big problem. It's just one year. The next years may be different.\"</p><p>In the meantime, David Beckham, one suspects, will enjoy being the last Englishman standing. Three sides from Spain, two from Germany and one each from Italy, Turkey and France have made it. The draw is on Friday, when Uefa will map out the route to 25 May at Wembley. English football will have its nose pressed to the window outside.</p><p><em>This article has been amended since first publication</em></p>","headline":"Champions League failure is not a reason for English clubs to panic, yet","trailText":"<strong>Daniel Taylor:</strong> A Premier League club is not in the draw for the last eight for the first time in 17 years, but what does it mean for English football?","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/3/14/1363268144927/Arsenal-Champions-League-003.jpg","wordcount":"1340","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-21T13:43:45Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/mar/14/champions-league-failure-english-clubs","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2013/mar/14/champions-league-failure-english-clubs","tags":[{"id":"football/championsleague","webTitle":"Champions League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/championsleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/500"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.
