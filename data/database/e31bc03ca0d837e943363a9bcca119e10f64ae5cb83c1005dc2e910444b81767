Chelsea have the easier run-in, despite having to go to Anfield and facing Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, and Touré said it was wrong for José Mourinho to claim City were in the best position.</p><p>\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Chelsea are nine points ahead. Yes, we have three games in hand but we could lose all three of them. Chelsea, for me, are the favourites.\"</p><p>Touré said Mourinho ought to stop making public comments about rival teams. \"He is a coach and he must give respect a little bit,\" he told Marca. \"He is always talking about everyone and that is not the correct way. That is why Barcelona always beat Real Madrid when Mourinho was here. I think he talks more than before, perhaps because the English press likes it.\"</p><p>Touré was asked whether it would constitute a failure if City, until recently talking openly about a possible quadruple, finished the season with nothing more. \"Why? Why would it be? We have already won a cup. You cannot say that. Football is a competition – only one team can win each of the trophies.</p><p>\"Don't say we'd be failures when we've won something already. Now we want to win more but teams are desperate to beat us, so it's always tough. Teams are very motivated against us. You have to understand we are not a machine.\"</p><p>City's next assignment is at Hull on Saturday. Vincent Kompany said after the 2-1 defeat in the Camp Nou that his side \"had nothing left in the tank\" and they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/13/manchester-city-barcelona-fear-vincent-kompany\" title=\"\">waiting to find out the seriousness of Sergio Agüero's latest hamstring injury</a>.</p><p>\"The most important thing is that we will get more rest now, not playing three times a week,\" Touré said. \"We've been involved in so many competitions and it's so hard, with national teams as well. It's always so difficult.</p><p>\"We have lost Agüero again, who is always an important player for us. But everything is going to be easier for us now, with only the Premier League left, so I hope we can finish well. We know it's going to be difficult but with the players we have I still think we can do it.\"</p><p>Agüero was substituted at half-time against Barcelona and his absence would represent a significant setback for a team who have scored only eight times in the last eight games, losing four of them. \"Hopefully it's nothing serious,\" Pablo Zabaleta, who was sent off, said. \"He'll have scans to check if he's OK, so fingers crossed. We know how important he is for the team.\"</p>","headline":"Manchester City's Yaya Touré: one trophy triumph would not be a failure","trailText":"Yaya Touré said it will not be a failure for Manchester City if they finish the season with only the Capital One Cup despite their trophyless 2012-13","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/3/13/1394741550787/Yaya-Tour--hugs-Lionel-Me-006.jpg","wordcount":"522","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-16T22:30:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/13/manchestercity-capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/13/manchestercity-capital-one-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/sergio-aguero","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sergio-aguero","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sergio-aguero","references":[]},{"id":"football/chelsea","webTitle":"Chelsea","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/chelsea","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/4"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.

He had just been asked whether Sunderland's performance <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">in the Capital One Cup final</a> could help galvanise them in their battle to avoid relegation. His team had given everything and could be forgiven for feeling unfortunate that, almost out of nowhere, Yaya Touré and Samir Nasri had produced two moments of brilliance out of keeping with everything Manuel Pellegrini's side had put together until that point. But Poyet was not buying it. It was unmistakable sadness on face when he really should be more optimistic. Sunderland may have lost their chance of a first trophy since 1973, but they had played with the togetherness, commitment and know-how of a side that can avoid the drop. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Manchester City 3-1 Sunderland</a><br /><a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/static/9ed228b058df59a03f04cef3f4efdfe5b3d063ee/common/styles/images/gallery_140.png\" title=\"\">• Pictures: Tom Jenkins's images from Wembley</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-wembley-win-sunderland-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">• Barney Ronay: Cup final oozed old-school magic</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-player-ratings\" title=\"\">• James Riach's player ratings from the final</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/03/manuel-pellegrini-manchester-city-manchester-united-manager\" title=\"\">• Pellegrini appears to make Man Utd blunder</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-talking-points-capital-one-cup-final\" title=\"\">• Jamie Jackson: Capital One Cup talking points</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manuel-pellegrini-manchester-city-capital-one-cup-sunderland\" title=\"\">• Pellegrini warns City one trophy is not enough</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/gus-poyet-sunderland-manchester-city-capital-one-cup-final\" title=\"\">• Poyet salutes Sunderland's Wembley display</a></p></blockquote><h2>2) A turning point for Soldado</h2><p>Tottenham know all about what can happen when a striker casts off the shackles and gives free rein to his instincts. After Emmanuel Adebayor was recalled to the team by Tim Sherwood in mid-December, he made a scoring breakthrough and has built upon it. With his confidence high, the Togolese has 11 goals in 15 appearances. The fervent hope at White Hart Lane is that it can now be Roberto Soldado's turn to go on a spree and fire the challenge for a Champions League finish. The £26m signing from Valencia has contributed in the Europa League and from the penalty spot in the Premier League but he had come to be beaten by a single statistic. Going into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/tottenham-hotspur-cardiff-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sunday's home game against Cardiff City</a>, he had scored only once in the league from open play. The second finally arrived to sink Cardiff and it was similar to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/20/aston-villa-tottenham-premier-league\" title=\"\">the one that he scored at Aston Villa last October</a> – the burst of pace, touch and finish. Soldado did little else against Cardiff but it did not matter. Strikers thrive on goals; Soldado had got his. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/tottenham-hotspur-cardiff-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Cardiff City</a></p></blockquote><h2>3) Don't expect Mourinho to give up the cautious approach</h2><p>Chelsea can move nine points clear of Manchester City, the side considered to be favourites to claim the title, if they beat Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday evening. Manuel Pellegrini's team will admittedly have three games in hand and are bolstered by an impressive goal difference, but such a gap in March still feels significant with City denied any margin for error in the fixture clutter ahead. Yet José Mourinho is unlikely to change his tune when it comes to his team's challenge. Would he prefer to have the points banked away or the games in hand still to come? \"I'd prefer to have destiny in my own hands, and only City have the destiny in their hands at the moment,\" said the Portuguese. \"If I win every game until the end of the season, all 10 of them – which we won't – maybe we are still not champions. If they win all 12 games they have, they are the champions.\" The mathematics cannot be disputed. Yet the pressure that will mount on City, with Liverpool on the charge and Arsenal also above them at present, is mounting as domestic cup competitions serve as a distraction. Chelsea, quietly and almost in spite of Mourinho's caution, are edging clear. <strong>Dominic Fifield </strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/jose-mourinho-chelsea-fulham\" title=\"\">• Schürrle and Hazard clear up Chelsea's Fulham mess</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/mar/02/jose-mourinho-silence-chelsea-video\" title=\"\">• Video: Mourinho used half-time silence to inspire Chelsea</a></p></blockquote><h2>4) Will West Ham's Italians be seen?</h2><p>They seemed two of the most exciting January signings. Marco Borriello was a prolific strike partner for Francesco Totti at Roma. Antonio Nocerino was the revelation of Milan's 2011-12 season. Instead, neither has started a game for West Ham and, given their improved run and the return to fitness of stalwarts within Sam Allardyce's side, it is very possible neither will. On current form, it is hard to argue they should be parachuted into the team but it would be a shame if both on-loan Italians departed without being given an opportunity to display their ability. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/sam-allardyce-andy-carroll-england-romelu-lukaku-west-ham-everton\" title=\"\">• Allardyce backs Carroll for England</a></p></blockquote><h2>5) Pardew is his own worst enemy</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/alan-pardew-head-butt-newcastle-united-hull-city\" title=\"\">Saturday's match at the KC Stadium featured five goals</a>, a host of chances and an impressive away victory for Newcastle United. Nobody was talking about any of the above after the game, thanks to another bizarre intervention from Newcastle boss Alan Pardew – a man drawn to controversy like the proverbial moth to a flame. Pardew has accumulated quite the rap sheet of touchline transgressions in recent years – from shoving referees to abusing his elders – but yesterday was a spectacular new low. Pardew may have stopped short of making injurious contact with David Meyler's jaw, but this snarling, seemingly unprovoked attack was the stuff of pub car parks, not a position where by definition, you must lead by example. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/01/alan-pardew-headbutts-hull-city-david-meyler\" title=\"\">Pardew has been fined a six figure sum by the club</a>, but it appears he may escape with his job. That the Magpies' manager finds himself in this precarious position, after relieving weeks of pressure with back-to-back league wins, is testament to his self-destructive qualities – and it could cost him a shot at the job he may covet above all others. Pardew's withdrawal from the race to replace Fabio Capello in 2012 drew howls of derision, yet he remains the longest serving Englishman in the top flight by a distance. If Roy Hodgson is to be succeeded by a compatriot, Pardew should be under automatic consideration – the fact he is currently a 25/1 outsider is down to the outbursts that have dogged his career. The FA simply will not hand one of the most heavily scrutinised roles in world football to a man who can't navigate a March mid-table game without putting his foot in it. With his vulgar display of misplaced machismo, Pardew let his players and club down badly. Most of all though, he let himself down. <strong>Niall McVeigh</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/alan-pardew-head-butt-newcastle-united-hull-city\" title=\"\">• Pardew hits back at suggestions he should be sacked</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/mar/02/alan-pardew-head-butt-video\" title=\"\">• Video: 'I have no explanation for head-butt', says Pardew</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/mar/01/alan-pardew-headbutts-david-myler-in-pictures\" title=\"\">• Pictures: the astonishing scenes at KC stadium</a></p></blockquote><h2>6) Rodgers adjusts while remaining true to his philosophy</h2><p>\"For me the system is irrelevant. You look at each game and it's about getting the best out of what we have available against the opponents we're playing. The style is always the same: to control and dominate the game, be tactically strong and be very good in transition and we saw all of those aspects. We've played 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and 3-5-2 [this season] and today we played 4-4-2 diamond and you've got to heap huge praise on to the players.\" Of course, what Brendan Rodgers may have really meant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-title-expectations-southampton\" title=\"\">after Saturday's victory</a> over a fine Southampton side is that you've got to heap huge praise on to him but, in fairness, he deserves it. His tactical versatility is an asset to Liverpool and the tweak that he made on Saturday helped secure a valuable victory, not least because it restored Luis Suárez to a more central position. Rodgers's ability to learn and adjust while remaining true to his philosophy was particularly striking on a day when Arsenal, who almost never change, showed familiar signs of unravelling. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-title-expectations-southampton\" title=\"\">• Rodgers says Liverpool can handle title expectations</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/mar/02/liverpool-strategy-stay-calm-video\" title=\"\">• Video: Rodgers's strategy for last 10 games: 'Stay calm'</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/02/liverpool-john-henry-luis-suarez-clause\" title=\"\">• Liverpool 'admit' Suárez £40m buyout clause</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/01/roy-hodgson-daniel-sturridge-england-denmark-friendly\" title=\"\">• Amy Lawrence: Hodgson wants Sturridge to shine</a></p></blockquote><h2>7) Stoke still retain old habits </h2><p>Stoke are not really a rugby team, although their supporters enjoy the joke, but they need to clean up their act in regard to foul play. Arsène Wenger mentioned that they top the Premier League in that respect, clearly still mindful of what happened to Aaron Ramsey at the Britannia Stadium, and quite possibly kept Mesut Özil on the bench <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-stoke-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">for most of Saturday's game</a> because he did not wish to see him targeted. Stoke simply targeted Olivier Giroud instead, with Glenn Whelan escaping a booking for one rash challenge, Erik Pieters earning a caution for the next, and Charlie Adam getting away scot free – at least until television replays catch up with him – for the most cynical of the lot. Mark Hughes came over all innocent afterwards, but if he is supposed to be changing perceptions of the way Stoke play, he needs to make an honest appraisal of some of his regular offenders. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-stoke-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">• Match report: Stoke City 1-0 Arsenal</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/mar/02/arsene-wenger-stokes-goal-referree-video?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">• Video: Wenger calls Stoke's goal 'nice gift from referee'</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/arsenal-arsene-wenger-sean-ingle\" title=\"\">• Sean Ingle: Arsenal lose bite when it comes to the crunch</a></p></blockquote><h2>8) Pulis won't stand for those that fall</h2><p>His attritional football may not be to everybody's liking, but Tony Pulis has at least one principle which nobody can fault. After seeing two of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/swansea-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace players dive in attempting to gain undeserved free-kicks at Swansea</a>, the Palace manager announced that he would be fining Marouane Chamakh and Jerome Thomas for it. Pulis said: \"I have already spoken to Jerome. I think he has fallen over at any touch and he will get fined for that. Chamakh did it in the first half and he will get fined as well. In the last couple of years in this country everybody has cleaned up those situations. Jerome has gone in and seen the ref and apologised to him, and that is good. I just don't have that at any football club I manage.\" <strong>Joe Lovejoy</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/swansea-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Swansea 1-1 Crystal Palace</a></p></blockquote><h2>9) Hughton is back under the microscope</h2><p>Stick or twist? That is the dilemma, once again, for the Norwich City board. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/aston-villa-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sunday's 4-1 defeat at Aston Villa</a> – a team that started the day as the joint-lowest scorers at home in the Premier League and without a goal in 326 minutes of football – placed Chris Hughton's position as manager back under the microscope. After a bright start that included an early lead, it was alarming to see Norwich disintegrate so badly during a 16-minute spell in the first half when Villa scored four times. It was worrying on a different level to hear their travelling supporters mocking the team in the second half, when they sarcastically cheered passes and sang \"shot on target\" after a rare attack. Hughton said that he understood the fans' frustration. Whether the Carrow Road board are so understanding with him remains to be seen. Norwich are the only club in the bottom seven not to have changed their manager this season. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/aston-villa-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Aston Villa 4-1 Norwich City</a></p></blockquote>","headline":"Premier League and Capital One Cup: talking points from the weekend","trailText":"<p><strong>Guardian writers:</strong> Gus Poyet can take heart, Alan Pardew is his own worst enemy, don't expect José Mourinho to give up the cautious approach</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/3/3/1393821402177/Premier-League-composite-003.jpg","wordcount":"1785","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-10T09:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/03/talking-points-premier-league-capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/03/talking-points-premier-league-capital-one-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/premierleague","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/100"}]},{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.

The 60-year-old's default mode is modesty and his pre-final message was that this day was all about the players and the club. Yet with the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League still being chased Pellegrini can now refocus knowing that this season is already a success.</p><p>For his opposite number, Gus Poyet, there will be pride but the overriding sentiment is bitter disappointment. As the&nbsp;Sunderland manager said: \"We had a go, we did everything we could. Defeat today, I hate it. I hate losing but I'm proud of the players. If we do this every week I'm sure we will stay in the Premier League and will come back to Wembley [in the FA Cup].\"</p><h2>2 … but he nearly pays for his selection</h2><p>When City's teamsheet dropped, the big call seemed to be the manager's selection of Costel Pantilimon for Joe Hart: the Romanian avoided the ignominy of being dropped for successive Wembley showpieces, following last year's FA Cup final disappointment when Hart was preferred by Roberto Mancini, Pellegrini's predecessor. Yet as the contest unfolded the decision to stand down Álvaro Negredo for Edin Dzeko while also plumping for&nbsp;Martín Demichelis rather than Joleon Lescott appeared questionable.</p><p>In Dzeko, City have a forward who weighs in with crucial goals but whose clumsy touch and sluggish thought is at odds with the Pellegrini blueprint of fluid, flexible football. Demichelis might&nbsp;have hoped to enjoy a more comfortable outing than the dire one endured in the Champions League defeat to Barcelona. But the 33-year-old again appeared off the pace when Sunderland scored the opening goal: a geriatric in a young man's game.</p><h2>3 Adam Johnson is man of the first half</h2><p>Of his move to the north-east two summers ago, Johnson offered: \"I wanted to be the Agüero in the team. That's half the reason I wanted to come back to Sunderland. I didn't want to be a big fish in a big pond. You're sort of overlooked at the time. I wanted to come and have that sort of pressure. I wanted to test myself and I wanted to be an individual.\"</p><p>The former Manchester City man proceeded to do all of this during an opening half when he put in a display that would raise questions about why Roy Hodgson excluded him from England's squad for this week's friendly with Denmark. In this exhibition of scintillating wing play that featured Johnson creating Fabio Borini's opener with a delightful pass, the Sunderland native illustrated why City bought him from Middlesbrough in January 2010. Yet perhaps the most impressive element was Johnson's willingness to defend as well as attack, his natural option.</p><h2>4 Cometh the hour, cometh City's star names</h2><p>For 54 minutes Sunderland pummelled City's marquee footballers who were threatened with a rerun of their miserable FA Cup final defeat here last May. This was before two minutes that took the tie away from the Black Cats. First, Yaya Touré swung the sweetest of right boots through the ball to beat Vito Mannone with a 30-yard shot that made it a hat-trick of Wembley goals following winning strikes in the FA Cup semi-final and final of 2011.</p><p>Then, after a roar from the sky-blue faithful that was drenched with relief, came the one that greeted Samir Nasri's instant outside-of-the-boot finish moments later: this was of sheer joy. The two strikes meant the sight of Agüero being taken off, after the 26-goal man had been restored for a first time since 29 January after a hamstring injury, was less of a blow for City.</p><h2>5 Lee Cattermole and Fabio Borini shine</h2><p>They ended up on the losing side but the midfielder and striker can reflect on an occasion in which they performed to their very best. Cattermole produced a display of the total midfielder – combative in the tackle, offering direction to his team and spraying passes left and right. The manner in which he latched on to a loose ball early on, beating Touré to it, before surging forward and curving the ball into the path of Johnson set the tone for Sunderland's fine first period.</p><p>Cattermole's intervention would also prove an augury of the opening goal as he won the ball from Fernandinho before playing in Johnson, and possession being relayed to Borini. The way the Italian, who is on loan from Liverpool, swerved the finish past Pantilimon to leave the goalkeeper with no chance, was impressive. But as with the rest of their team, Borini and Cattermole faded after the break.</p>","headline":"Manchester City v Sunderland: Capital One Cup final talking points","trailText":"<strong>Jamie

Redeemed himself with a superb tackle on the striker when 1-0 down</p><p><strong>Martín Demichelis 5 </strong>Reacted slowly to Johnson's ball over the top for the first goal and later switched off and played Borini onside. Kompany saved his bacon with a fine challenge</p><p><strong>Aleksandar Kolarov 6 </strong>Started brightly but made little impact in a first half when City were limited going forward. Played a key role in the Nasri goal, firing a fizzing ball across the box</p><p><strong>Fernandinho 7 </strong>Made a key challenge to dispossess Alonso in the closing stages, which led to City's third goal. Frustrated in the first half but regained his level</p><p><strong>Yaya Touré 7 </strong>Had been quiet in the first half but his goal was superb. From then on hebegan to control midfield, although never exerted his influence to his full capacity</p><p><strong>Samir Nasri 8 </strong>Had shown glimpses of quality before lashing home City's second goal with the ball coming across at some pace. A fine finish and he grew into the game</p><p><strong>David Silva 6 </strong>Found space at a premium in the early stages and struggled to find his usual pockets. Still effective and was withdrawn after 77 minutes for the more defensive-minded García</p><p><strong>Sergio Agüero 6 </strong>Forced a good save out of Mannone early on and was the only City player who carried an attacking threat in the first half. A reasonable show on his comeback from injury</p><p><strong>Edin Dzeko 4</strong> Touch and movement let him down on several occasions, occupying space that Agüero was looking to run into.

Helpless for the Nasri strike but got a hand to Navas's strike</p><p><strong>Phil Bardsley 6 </strong>Battled well throughout and made a crucial clearance in front of his own goal early on. But the ball in for Nasri's goal came from his flank</p><p><strong>Wes Brown 6 </strong>Was exposed along with O'Shea for the last goal but performed well in the first half. Smacked the ground in frustration after City's third, but did not do much wrong</p><p><strong>John O'Shea 6 </strong>Alongside Brown he soaked up everything City could throw at Sunderland in the first half. Undone by two excellent goals but other than that performed admirably</p><p><strong>Marcos Alonso 6</strong> Dispossessed high up the pitch for City's third goal but defended well for the most part and was effective on occasion going forward</p><p><strong>Lee Cattermole 7 </strong> Hounded City's midfield and crucially robbed Fernandinho in the build-up to Borini's goal. Dominated the middle of the park in the first half and kept the ball well but faded</p><p><strong>Jack Colback 7 </strong>Epitomised Sunderland's energy in the first half, flying into challenges and pressing City in midfield. Continued to fight but was starved of the ball once City scored</p><p><strong>Ki Sung-yueng 6 </strong>Retained possession well in the first half and kept things ticking along for Sunderland although, as the game progressed, became slightly overawed in midfield</p><p><strong>Sebastian Larsson 6 </strong>Scurried around for the hour that he was on the pitch. Looked unhappy at being withdrawn but Poyet said frustration was down to being fouled in build-up to Touré's strike</p><p><strong>Adam Johnson 7 </strong>Superb ball for Borini's goal and carried a serious threat to City's defence with his trickery before being replaced by Gardner on the hour</p><p><strong>Fabio Borini 8 </strong>Fine finish for the opening goal, matching Kompany for strength before firing in low from an acute angle.

I didn't want any mistakes, any bad decisions, sending-off or own-goals. We had the best shot that we had, we tried our best. We tried our best, we need to be proud.</p><p>\"It's up to me now; it's my responsibility to use this in the right way. I don't like excuses, I'm not going to give the players an opportunity to have an excuse because we lost today. No chance.</p><p>\"Everything needed to be perfect and it wasn't. We need to make sure, everyone inside that dressing room, that now we don't have any excuses, we don't give up and we stay in the Premier League.\"</p><p>Vito Mannone, the Sunderland goalkeeper, was helpless as Touré curled in a superb effort from 35 yards 10 minutes after half-time and the Italian was a mere spectator seconds later as Nasri lashed in Manchester City's second.</p><p>Poyet admitted that Sunderland's only chance of a victory would have required a poor performance from City but said his team were in the end powerless to prevent a cruel defeat.</p><p>\"If you score from 35 yards to the top corner …  maybe we need to play two goalkeepers and we will have a chance. We couldn't do better. The quality decided the game, the two wonder finishes.</p><p>\"We didn't make any mistakes today, we gave nothing away. They needed to be average on the day. If they [City] have a good day, you have a problem. In two minutes it was like bang-bang.</p><p>\"We knew that everything had to go for us. Our little foul was not given, a wonder goal from Yaya Touré and then an incredible finish from Nasri. There was things that you expect today not to happen. But I'm proud of the players, I'm proud of the fans. I can promise them that we gave the best shot that we had.</p><p>\"I think for 50-plus minutes we were more than a decent team and I think the fans need to stay proud because the players tried their best. For the second one I don't know if Nasri hit it with a full boot or a bit of shin as well but it was an absolutely outstanding finish.\"</p><p>Larsson appeared unhappy at being substituted after 60 minutes but Poyet claimed the Swede's frustration was because the referee had not awarded a foul against him before Touré struck the equaliser. Shortly afterwards the Sunderland assistant manager, Mauricio Taricco, appeared to be in heated discussions with some players on the bench.</p><p>\"It was a foul before Touré's goal,\" Poyet said. \"I'm not going to be hypocrite and blame the referee but it was a foul. It was a very easy foul to give. He [Atkinson] will have an excuse anyway; they always have an excuse.\"</p><p>Poyet, asked if their Capital One Cup campaign will help Sunderland in their fight against relegation, remained optimistic and said the team must approach next week's Premier League match against Crystal Palace in the same manner as the cup final.</p><p>\"Maybe being in the cup this week helps. We make the game against Palace bigger than today. But when we are on the losing side I hate it.\"</p>","headline":"Gus Poyet salutes Sunderland's display in defeat by Manchester City","trailText":"Gus Poyet was proud of Sunderland's performance in defeat by Manchester City in the Capital One Cup final and believes it will have a positive effect in their fight for Premier League survival","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393789161411/Gus-Poyet-the-Sunderland--006.jpg","wordcount":"706","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-05T19:41:19Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/gus-poyet-sunderland-manchester-city-capital-one-cup-final","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/gus-poyet-sunderland-manchester-city-capital-one-cup-final","tags":[{"id":"football/gus-poyet","webTitle":"Gus Poyet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gus-poyet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/gus-poyet","references":[]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/james-riach","webTitle":"James Riach","r2ContributorId":"49942","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/13/1376408310613/JamesRiach.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>James Riach is a sports journalist for the Guardian, specialising in football.

As superheated, financially-stupefied spectacles go, it can still pull off a grand sense of cup final occasion. On the face of it the story of Manchester City's triumph here in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Capital One Cup final </a>– team spends inconceivable amounts of money: team wins minor domestic trophy – might look like another routine exercise in the overdog domination of English football's gold rush years. Just as in outline it might be hard to detect the romance in a disjointed but still somehow inevitable victory for a club not so much bankrolled as gullet-fed by the fossil fuel illuminati of Abu Dhabi. But then, this is a sport and a sporting culture that refuses to be suffocated. Days like these, for all the broader hierarchy of interests, are still about the fans, and City's boisterous, full-throated Wembley support celebrated here like an island full of shipwrecked men who have just spied a sail on the horizon.</p><p>City were always likely to win this final, the cutting edge in that stellar attacking midfield just too much even in a patchy performance against opponents who were for long periods the better team. And yet despite the sense of inevitability about the result this was still a brilliantly entertaining final, an occasion memorable for the sense of unaffected excitement among both sets of fans.</p><p>Football has done its best to suck the joy out of these occasions both in terms of staging and broader priorities. But as Vincent Kompany lifted the trophy to the strains of a wretchedly intrusive PA system, the air filled with sky blue streamers in a further nod to the usual nannied euphoria, there was still something unbound and gloriously incredulous in the reaction of City's fans and players who, for all their pedigree, honoured this competition by giving everything on the pitch and celebrating wildly in victory.</p><p>It seems safe to say City's owners have not invested £1bn in the club's redevelopment in order to see their team edge past Sunderland on a drizzly afternoon in early March. Given the choice the club's hierarchy would no doubt swap a cup win here for victory in the Champions League last-16 tie against Barcelona and the promise of a more worldly kind of progress. Not City's fans, though, for whom, as for all supporters, football is a game marked out by moments such as these, and for whom this was a day of almost rather subversive old-school glory.</p><p>Hours before kick-off Wembley had been transformed into a crush of fevered blue, red and white. Such is the magic of the cup, any cup, even one subjected as here to a slightly bizarre pre-match routine featuring giant flag-carrying zeppelins – \"Ladeeezzz and gentleman pleazzz show your appreciation for … your club's crest!\" – and a strange interlude with a floating spandex-clad gymnast performing an overwrought modern dance routine with the trophy itself, as though overcome by its wondrous mystical powers. Have a little faith, Wembley, you felt like saying. It's football. We're already excited.</p><p>As the match kicked off to an ear-tingling crackle of noise around this refurbished steel and concrete megadome Lee Cattermole and Jack Colback set about the task of stifling City's midfield, which they did with some success. In fact Sunderland were excellent throughout, with Cattermole, Colback and Ki Sung-yueng uncowed in midfield against a dauntingly strong City team.</p><p>Sunderland's opening goal after 10 minutes was exhilarating, Fabio Borini's finish with the outside of his right foot a superbly executed moment of craft. And so the match settled into an unexpected rhythm of energetic Sunderland pressing and some strangely meandering City possession, matched in the Wembley stands by a peculiar sense of foreboding among their supporters.</p><p>On the touchline Manuel Pellegrini mooched and pointed vaguely, while Gus Poyet was his usual frantic air-throttling self, a man who has to fold his arms across his chest simply to stop them jangling about like the wings of a particularly agitated carved wooden woodpecker.</p><p>And yet football is a game where enough thickly ladled talent will always make the difference. Yaya Touré had barely figured&nbsp;in the opening 55 minutes but it took a single perfectly calibrated swing of his right foot to alter completely the gravity of this match, the ball dipping perfectly into the far top corner. Moments&nbsp;later a &nbsp;goal kick, three touches by Sergio Agüero, a cross from Aleksandar Kolarov and Samir Nasri had sent the ball whiffling first time into the far corner. And suddenly the stadium had been tipped on its side, the noise and ceaseless movement of the red half now sloshed down decisively into the blue end as victory was capped by Jesús Navas's late third goal.</p><p>Afterwards Pellegrini, for whom this was a first piece of silverware since Intertoto Cup glory with Villarreal in 2004, was his usual inscrutable self, confirming his belief above all in the wider project and all the rest of it. Somehow it wasn't quite the moment for that. For all the broader textural changes in English football, you really can't – try as you might – kill the spirit, and this felt like a significant moment both for City's fans who saw their team win this trophy for the first time since 1976, and for the broader sense of undampened life in a genuinely stirring domestic occasion.</p>","headline":"Manchester City's Wembley win over Sunderland oozed old-school magic","trailText":"<strong>Barney Ronay: </strong>For all the winners' riches and the intrusive hype, the Capital One Cup final was a thrilling throwback that mattered massively to both sets of fans","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/3/2/1393788420516/Manchester-City-fans-006.jpg","wordcount":"886","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-05T20:40:11Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-wembley-win-sunderland-capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-wembley-win-sunderland-capital-one-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/barneyronay","webTitle":"Barney Ronay","r2ContributorId":"21010","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/12/barney_ronay_140x140.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733869/BarneyRonay.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Barney Ronay is senior sports writer for guardian.co.uk.

For long spells, Manchester City had toyed with the idea of another deeply unsatisfactory cup final, but when they finally shook their heads clear there was something devastating about the way they set about turning this match upside down.</p><p>Manuel Pellegrini's team had been trailing to driven, highly motivated opponents and looking conspicuously short of ideas when Yaya Touré, with a typically elegant swish of his right foot, curled a shot into the top corner of Vito Mannone's net to announce the recovery process.</p><p>It was one of the great Wembley goals since the new stadium took shape and what followed, off the outside of Samir Nasri's boot, could easily fall into the same category. Pellegrini's men had taken their time but that quick one-two, in the space of 105 seconds, completely changed the emphasis before the last, slightly cruel breakaway when Jesús Navas guaranteed the first piece of silverware this season was on its way to Manchester.</p><p>Sunderland had given everything and deserved the lead that Fabio Borini had supplied 10 minutes into a first half that, for City, had invoked a clinging sense of deja vu from last season's FA Cup final. Afterwards, Pellegrini indicated that the memories of that defeat to Wigan Athletic might have contributed to City's early nerves. Yet the turnaround was a great reminder of the disparity between a team from the Premier League's relegation places and the most financially endowed club in the land. Sunderland never showed any hint of inferiority complex from the moment Phil Bardsley scythed down David Silva in the first few minutes. But City, even below their most distinguished best, still had it within themselves to conjure up these moments.</p><p>For that, Sunderland ought to feel no shame. It is possible to lose and to play well and Gus Poyet's team, with Ki Sung-yeung outstanding, did not go down without a commendable show of togetherness. Borini's goal was another peach, on a day of outstanding finishing at one end of the stadium, and City had been second best before Touré reminded us of the uncommon scoring ability that has brought him 17 goals this season.</p><p>Touré, to recap, has the starting position of a holding midfielder. He had been almost 30 yards out when he took aim, striking the ball first time from Pablo Zabaleta's layoff, with just the right amount of curl and loft to put it in the part of the goal Mannone was never going to reach.</p><p>Perhaps Sunderland had fallen into the trap of defending a little too deeply. In the first half, certainly, Touré would probably not have been given time without Lee Cattermole or Seb Larsson closing him down. Yet Poyet, who felt Larsson had been fouled in the build-up, made the point afterwards there is nothing much an opposition manager can do to legislate for these moments of individual brilliance - \"unless you shoot him\" - and it was the same from virtually the next City attack.</p><p>This time, Sergio Agüero latched on to Costel Pantilimon's kick and turned the ball into Aleksandar Kolarov's path. His cross from the left was deflected across the penalty area and, without breaking stride, Nasri took it first time, showing remarkable control to send it spinning and swerving into the same corner Borini had picked out in the first half. \"We didn't make any mistakes today,\" Poyet lamented. \"They won it with their quality.\"</p><p>After that, Sunderland had no option but to break out from counter-attacking and there were always going to be moments when they left gaps for their opponents to exploit. Poyet's team certainly did not give up easily but the substitute Steven Fletcher made a pig's ear of their best opportunity and there were four City players against two defenders when Touré broke free and advanced over the halfway line in the last minute of normal time. Navas, overlapping on the right, had been bright and lively after replacing Agüero and made sure of Pellegrini's first trophy for the club with a right-foot finish.</p><p>It had been some turnaround and it was difficult not to sympathise with Sunderland. Their supporters had given them immense backing and they will wonder what might have been if Borini had not been caught by Vincent Kompany when he ran clear, looking offside but with no flag raised, seven minutes before half-time. Kompany had been unconvincing for Borini's goal but this was a crucial interception.</p><p>The Sunderland goal had started with Cattermole dispossessing Fernandinho, in a little snapshot of how the first half panned out. Larsson moved the ball to Adam Johnson and the former City player turned defence from attack with a long, measured pass through the inside-right channel to examine whether Borini could get away from Kompany and Martin Demichelis.</p><p>There was something Suárez-esque about the way Borini eluded them both, left Kompany on his backside and used the outside of his right boot to bend his shot past Pantilimon.</p><p>It was a brilliant and quick piece of improvisation but City's response after the break - \"be calm, be patient,\" were the words Pellegrini said he used - was a reminder, ultimately, of the superior quality at the top end of the league.</p>","headline":"Manchester City win League Cup as Touré wonder goal sparks comeback","trailText":"Yaya Touré and Samir Nasri scored superb goals to help Manchester City come from behind to beat Sunderland at Wembley","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393774989899/Manchester-City-v-Sunderl-006.jpg","wordcount":"860","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-05T16:06:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-match-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-match-report","tags":[{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/danieltaylor","webTitle":"Daniel Taylor","rcsId":"GNL004624","r2ContributorId":"15529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/8/18/1376837814617/Daniel-Taylor-byline-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736742/DanielTaylor.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Daniel Taylor is chief football writer for the Guardian and Observer.

However, they never came out for the second half. Or more accurately, City just took control. That goal from Touré  was sensational (as was Nasri’s) and you felt that once that went in, Sunderland would struggle to get back into it.

They have it all. </p><p><b>How many of the Sunderland players would make it into the Manchester City team? </b>None. How many of the Manchester City players would make it into the Sunderland team? Exactly.  Sunderland have spent most of the season clinging to dear Premier League life and trying their best to undo the work done by Paolo di Canio. City, by contrast, have spent the season swanning around the top of table, dreaming of more league glory and testing themselves against Europe’s elite elevens. On the way to this final, Manuel Pellegrini’s side kept four clean sheets while Gus Poyet’s boys managed just one, and that was against League One titans, Peterborough. Manchester City, meanwhile, scored 19 goals in process; Sunderland bagged a mere 13. With all of this in mind, they should just tie those blue and ribbons on the trophy and tell the engraver that the quicker he gets going, the quicker he can tuck into the free booze and food, right? Heck even Poyet said in his pre-match presser: “I don’t want to be playing mind games but everyone is expecting them to win.”</p><p><b>And yet, the beauty of the beautiful game means that this game is by no means a foregone conclusion, a closed case, a door slammed shut. </b>Sunderland, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/11/manchester-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\">like Wigan last year against the same opposition</a>, could do it. They really could. Since the departure of Di Canio and Poyet’s appointment, they are a far more formidable and a far more well-formed side. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/22/arsenal-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\">They may have got hammered last week</a> but they can be forgiven for their minds being elsewhere the week before a cup final and besides that they have won three of their last six league matches, making them one of the of form sides in the Premier League right now. Besides that,  they have already  shown that the role of David suits them well when they knocked out teams that, on paper at least, should be better than them, not least, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/sunderland-chelsea-capital-one-cup\">Chelsea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/22/manchester-united-sunderland-capital-one-cup-match-report\">Manchester United</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/06/sunderland-southampton-capital-one-cup\">Southampton</a>. Sunderland fans should also find comfort in the fact <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/10/sunderland-manchester-city-premier-league\">their side has already beaten Manchester City this season</a>, one of only four teams in the league to do so.</p><p><b>“It’s going to be special,” said Poyet, who rather refreshingly has said he is putting Cup success ahead of league survival, though it is doubtful that the Sunderland suits – and perhaps even some fans – would agree with such a sentiment.</b> “This is my first season here and everything was very, very dark and sad when I arrived. Here and now we are 90 minutes, or 120, away from being the happiest people in England.”  The emphasis will, of course, be on City t come out and try break down Sunderland, who will surely be sensible enough to not play City at their own game and will look to hit the favourites on the break and along the flanks, City’s weak spot. If Sunderland can do that and defend like they did back in that 1-0 win then there is a chance the fans of Sunderland may be the happiest people in England come full-time.<br></p> </div> </div>","headline":"Manchester City v Sunderland: Capital One Cup final – as it happened!","trailText":"<b>Minute-by-minute report:</b> Manchester City overcame a stubborn Sunderland to win the League Cup final thanks to goals from Yaya Touré, Samir Nasri and Jesús Navas","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393776563511/c8b023b7-3548-45d0-8d5f-92634a2069f2-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"4879","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-05T12:00:26Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-live","tags":[{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ian-mccourt","webTitle":"Ian McCourt","r2ContributorId":"44900","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ian is a freelance subeditor and hails from Ireland</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ian-mccourt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/ian-mccourt","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-6bffddde-7735-40cd-83f1-3783bcb5d42d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393776562695/c8b023b7-3548-45d0-8d5f-92634a2069f2-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/2/1393776562695/c8b023b7-3548-45d0-8d5f-92634a2069f2-220x132.jpeg","source":"Action Images","photographer":"John Sibley","altText":"Samir Nasri celebrates after scoring the second goal for Manchester City in the League Cup final against Sunderland.","height":"132","credit":"John Sibley/Action Images","caption":"Samir Nasri celebrates after scoring the second goal for Manchester City in the League Cup final against Sunderland.

On the losing side with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/28/aston-villa-manchester-united-carling-cup-final\" title=\"\">Aston Villa in the League Cup against Manchester United in 2010</a>, Milner sat out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/14/manchester-city-stoke-city-fa-cup\" title=\"\">City's FA Cup win against Stoke</a> the following season, then got on to the pitch for the last half-hour against Wigan last year, only to find himself on the wrong end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/11/manchester-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup\" title=\"\">one of the great Wembley upsets</a>.</p><p>Sunday brings Sunderland and, on paper at least, a chance to bulk up the medal collection, though after the Wigan experience Milner has every reason to be wary of the underdog, especially as City were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/10/sunderland-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">beaten 1-0 on Wearside</a> not just this season but in each of their last four visits.  \"I don't really believe in bogey teams. The results might just be a coincidence but we need to make sure the same thing doesn't happen at Wembley,\" he says. \"We are disappointed with our record against them but there is no better place to put things right.\"</p><p>What still irks Milner about last year's FA Cup final is that City themselves were a let-down, disappointing some 60,000 supporters who made the trip. \"We didn't play anywhere near the level that we had set for ourselves but you cannot take anything away from Wigan,\" he says. \"They played very well and we got it wrong tactically. We didn't perform.</p><p>\"You have to hold up your hands and say Wigan deserved it but it still hurts because chances of winning a medal don't come around too often. That's why it is silly to think of the League Cup as a lesser competition. You are in a Wembley final, you are desperate to win. Anyone would love to have the medal and a major trophy on their CV. When you reach Wembley you think of the amount of hours you have put in training throughout your life, all the games you have played up to that point and, if you win a trophy, it is there forever as a reward.</p><p>\"Losing a cup final is massively disappointing but you can accept it if you play to your potential. I still ask myself how we managed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/28/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">to lose at Aston Villa</a> in the league this year, we dominated the game and ended up being beaten 3-2, but sometimes you can play well and the result doesn't go for you. The FA Cup final was different. We just didn't turn up.\"</p><p>It is widely imagined that uncertainty over Roberto Mancini's immediate future had something to do with that, though Milner is not the type to seek excuses. \"At a club like City there are things in the papers and talk all the time,\" he says. \"Ever since I've been a footballer I have coped with that. Think of the things that used to go on at Leeds, for instance. You get used to things being said in the press, stories coming out, reports that are untrue, that's football. We are professional players and we don't let talk affect our preparations. It is a sign of a strong dressing room that you stay focused on events on the field. You can't really control what happens off it.\"</p><p>Though still only 28 Milner seems to have been around for ages, due to breaking into the Leeds team at the same time as his contemporary Wayne Rooney was emerging at Everton. City is his fourth Premier League club, after spells at Newcastle and Villa, and while he plays often enough to remain in Roy Hodgson's World Cup plans the wealth of talent at Manuel Pellegrini's disposal means he cannot consider himself a regular.</p><p>Few actually can at the Etihad, apart from the captain, the goalkeeper and Sergio Agüero. \"I want to play every game but I know that is not possible at City,\" he says. \"The big question you have to answer for yourself is whether you are better playing every week at a lesser club or not playing quite as many games as you would like at City but contesting four trophies, taking part in Champions League nights and challenging for the title every year.</p><p>\"I honestly don't know what the right answer is but I feel valued at City and I love being at the club and working with the players we have. Every day is a learning process, the list of big names in the squad is endless and it is great to be around them.\"</p><p>Nothing if not dedicated, Milner has even taken lessons in Spanish in order to improve his communication with team-mates. \"I'm getting there,\" he explains. \"Zaba [Pablo Zabaleta] and David [Silva] actually speak very good English now but some of the newer Spanish players know they can come to me because I speak a bit of the language and it helps. It is not always easy for foreign players to adapt, the Premier League is very different from any other league in the world. There might be days in training when it's cold and windy but they see us running around and getting stuck in and, though they may be tired, it lifts them.</p><p>\"That's why, although the impact of the foreign players at the club has been outstanding, you need a nucleus of players who know the Premier League, people who know what to expect when it is snowing or when you are away at Hull City in January. The league is a 38-game slog and you need the likes of Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards who are massive influences in the dressing room.</p><p>\"Games at Wembley are an added bonus. One of my greatest memories is the day we beat United in the FA Cup semi at Wembley with half the ground doing the Poznan. The whole stadium was shaking, the memory will stick with me forever, and hopefully it was the same for the fans too. We know it is not cheap to attend these games, so giving the fans a good day out is definitely at the forefront of our minds.\"</p>","headline":"James Milner eager for winner's medal from Manchester City's cup run","trailText":"<p>For James Milner, disappointed before, winning the Capital One Cup with Manchester City would be a special moment</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393614878465/James-Milner-004.jpg","wordcount":"1003","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-04T23:00:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/01/james-milner-manchester-city-capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/01/james-milner-manchester-city-capital-one-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paulwilson","webTitle":"Paul Wilson","rcsId":"GNL023673","r2ContributorId":"16254","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/04/01/paul_wilson_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Wilson is the Observer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\">football</a> correspondent.

Excellent at maths, the young Uruguayan imagined that becoming an engineer would be the best way of putting his obsession with geometry and abstract equations to practical use.</p><p>Football pitches have suited his analytical yet highly creative mind even better. For almost three decades now Poyet's job – whether as an elegant goal-scoring midfielder or technical area choreographer – has been all about geometrical passing angles, correctly calibrated deliveries and tactical equations spiced by the human factor.</p><p>\"I like maths and trying to work out crazy problems,\" says the 46-year-old Sunderland manager who has experienced plenty of the latter since arriving on Wearside last October. With his team facing Manchester City in Sunday's Capital One Cup final at Wembley and having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/15/sunderland-southampton-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">reached the FA Cup quarter-finals</a> while embroiled in an enduring relegation battle, Poyet's season is perched precariously on the margins of glory and disaster.</p><p>He reiterates that survival is infinitely more important than cup success and yet the runs towards Wembley have proved an invaluable means of instilling his patient, possession-based, passing game and its constantly varying angles of attack into a squad that initially struggled to comprehend his purist philosophy. \"The ball is priceless,\" says the man who holds several principles in common with his one-time fellow Real Zaragoza midfielder, Everton's Roberto Martínez. \"I like to say I want the ball to be happy with us. If the ball talks, I want it to want to be on our side.\"</p><p>Despite his late father Washington's status as a basketball star in Uruguay, Poyet always preferred football, eventually accepting an offer from Nice to turn professional. No sooner had he arrived in Europe, however, than Nice discovered they had already used up their allocation of foreign players, leaving Poyet to head for an unhappy stint at Grenoble.</p><p>In some ways the slow beginning to his playing career – a brief return to South America was followed by high-profile stints with Zaragoza, Chelsea and Tottenham – has been reprised during a lengthy managerial induction.</p><p>On hanging up his boots, Poyet, his wife Madelon and sons Matias – now reading economics at Leeds University – and Diego – currently playing for Charlton – returned to Uruguay. But, much as they loved the climate, the pace of life was too slow and it was not long before the family were back in England with Poyet in a new role as Dennis Wise's assistant at first Swindon, then Leeds.</p><p></p><p>The pair had become firm friends as Chelsea midfielders, a rather unlikely bond emerging when the newly arrived Poyet defended Wise's initially unpopular dressing-room edict that everyone must speak English, all the time.</p><p>Dubbed \"The Radio\" by team-mates because of his constant chatter, Poyet's willingness to play the barrack-room lawyer when required appealed to Wise and the pair made a convincing double act in Wiltshire and West Yorkshire. \"Gus was top drawer,\" says a senior Leeds source. \"If he'd become manager I'm convinced we'd be doing well in the Premier League now.\"</p><p>Instead the Uruguayan returned to Spurs for an ill-fated stint as Juande Ramos's No2, even if their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/26/tottenham-hotspur-harry-redknapp\" title=\"\">joint sacking in 2008</a> changed his life. \"It was the right decision but it hurt,\" says Poyet. \"I was devastated. I decided I didn't want to be an assistant any more. I wanted to be in charge, making the decisions.\"</p><p>Not that there was exactly a stampede for his services. \"I started to worry when the summer of 2009 went by and I still couldn't find a team,\" he acknowledges. \"I thought, 'I'm going to have to take a risk and accept a challenge.'\"</p><p>Lying 20th in League One in November 2009, Brighton met both criteria. By the time Poyet left them, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/23/gus-poyet-sacked-brighton\" title=\"\">amid considerable acrimony</a>, nearly four years later, the south coast side had narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League. The former Tottenham manager turned pundit David Pleat was not surprised. \"I watched Brighton in League One and I was so impressed,\" recalls Poyet's old Spurs boss. \"Gus was one of the first coaches to use the style so many English teams use now: patient football, build from the back. A goalkeeper who plays the ball out short, full-backs pushing on outside three midfielders. It was courageous because managers at that level are under pressure to get the ball forward quickly.\"</p><p>The shame is that things ended so badly with Poyet sacked for gross misconduct before taking legal action – subsequently withdrawn – against Brighton. If the flashpoint was a scathing but hardly controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/18/gus-poyet-fuming-excrement-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">email he sent to club staff</a> demanding that those responsible for leaving excrement in the Amex Stadium's away dressing room before Crystal Palace's visit for last year's play-off semi-final be dismissed, relationships with Brighton's board had already become strained over what some perceived as his vaulting ambition.</p><p>After completing extensive due diligence before appointing him as Paolo Di Canio's successor, Sunderland were left satisfied he had done nothing wrong.</p><p>Not that he lacks a certain edge. After all, Roberto De Fanti <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/17/gus-poyet-sunderland-de-fanti-sack\" title=\"\">did not survive long</a> after Poyet hinted that he might quit were Sunderland's former director of football to have the final say on transfers. Otherwise few ripples have been created by a character whose skill in re-integrating Lee Cattermole and Phil Bardsley while restraining their powerful locker-room influence has contrasted markedly with Di Canio's self-destructively volatile man-management.</p><p>Poyet swiftly assembled Sunderland's scouts and gave them a PowerPoint presentation explaining his preferred 4-1-4-1 system and precisely the type of players he needed to make it work. Backroom staff who had become accustomed to managers taking much more of a broad brush approach were impressed by such meticulous devotion to detail.</p><p>On a human level club employees tend to warm to Poyet, with one describing him as \"a very kind person\". Such sentiments are echoed by the midfielder Ki Sung-yueng. \"Tactically Gus is very organised and smart,\" says Ki. \"But personally he's very kind and honest. If there's a problem he talks to you as a person and does not cheat or lie. I like that.\"</p><p>Poyet's decision to make his home in the heart of an unglamorous city shunned by predecessors who preferred to live in Newcastle, North Yorkshire or Durham has also gone down well. \"Gus is a pretty normal guy,\" says a club source. \"He's easy to deal with and you can have a normal conversation with him.\"</p><p>Even so, the lack of \"normality\" and weight of responsibility occasioned by a Premier League predicament inherited from Di Canio sporadically depresses a manager who laments a new-found inability to relax and lose himself in the novels he once adored. \"The words don't go in any more,\" he says. \"I won't be able to switch off until we're safe.\"</p><p>Wembley represents a welcome respite from the daily grind but cup glory plus impending Championship football would not satisfy Poyet's definition of a balanced equation. \"My mission is Premier League survival,\" he says. \"Staying up is the most important thing.\"</p>","headline":"Sunderland's Gus Poyet studying hard for Capital One Cup final","trailText":"Gus Poyet, a lover of mathematics, is eager Sunderland's season concludes with the positive

A delegation from Asante Kotoko approached Ellis Short, Sunderland's owner, and asked if the two clubs could form a collaborative relationship based on the exchange of marketing, charitable, sponsorship and sports science expertise.</p><p>It proved so successful that word spread to neighbouring countries. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/25/sunderland-david-miliband-africa\" title=\"\">With doors opened by David Miliband</a>, Sunderland's then vice-chairman and a former foreign secretary, the Wearsiders's profile rose steadily in one of football's emerging markets. Although Miliband had stepped down from the board by the time President Kikwete of Tanzania arrived in England last summer to meet world leaders gathering for the G8 summit, Kikwete made a detour to Sunderland and asked to meet Short.</p><p>Suitably impressed by a tour of the \"Academy of Light\" training centre, he then invited Margaret Byrne, Sunderland's chief executive, to Dar es Salaam and, in conjunction with the international electricity company Symbion Power, she and her boardroom colleagues agreed the club would help build Tanzania's first football academy.</p><p>The first bricks are scheduled to be laid within the next few weeks and the intention is to provide an academic as well as a football education while also using the facilities to benefit the wider community.</p><p>With the Africa initiative very much about winning hearts and minds, Sunderland have become involved in a variety of community initiatives, including the purchase and distribution of solar lamps in rural areas across a continent in which traditional kerosene lamps are expensive, environmentally unfriendly and extremely dangerous.</p><p>Then there is their support for Alive and Kicking in Ghana. An innovative Africa-wide charity dedicated to promoting health awareness and creating jobs, it employs local people, often disabled or disadvantaged, to hand-stitch leather footballs for either global sale or donation to schools, orphanages and refugee camps.</p><p>\"I think what makes us a bit different to some other English clubs is that we have a tangible presence in Africa – and we want to give something back to the communities,\" says Bryne, who has overseen the forging of formal ties between Sunderland and the Nelson Mandela Foundation in addition to shirt sponsorships, first with Invest in Africa and now Bidvest, the South African food and beverage company.</p><p>Through the latter Sunderland have forged a partnership with Johannesburg's Bidvest Wits, a leading South African team, dubbed \"the clever boys\". Having celebrated his 70th birthday with a charity dinner in aid of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Jimmy Montgomery, Sunderland's 1973 FA Cup goalkeeping hero and now a club ambassador, was recently invited to Johannesburg to see its work in action.</p><p>'We got to witness how the club's partnership is truly making a difference,\" says Montgomery. \"And we experienced the warmth and good feeling there is towards Sunderland in Africa.\"</p>","headline":"Sunderland win hearts and minds in Africa before Capital One Cup final","trailText":"A king and a president are impressed by the Premier League side, who have forged strong links with the continent","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/3/1/1393673659339/Sunderland-have-capitalis-004.jpg","wordcount":"595","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-04T11:54:53Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/01/capital-one-cup-sunderland-africa-ghana-tanzania-nigeria-south-africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/mar/01/capital-one-cup-sunderland-africa-ghana-tanzania-nigeria-south-africa","tags":[{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/gus-poyet","webTitle":"Gus Poyet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gus-poyet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/gus-poyet","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"profile/louisetaylor","webTitle":"Louise Taylor","r2ContributorId":"22724","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/09/18/louisetaylor.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Louise Taylor is north-east football correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/louisetaylor","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/louisetaylor","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431033146","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/3/1/1393673656616/Sunderland-have-capitalis-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Kim Ludbrook","altText":"Sunderland have capitalised on the African people's love of football and forged strong links","height":"340","credit":"Kim Ludbrook/EPA","caption":"Sunderland have capitalised on the African people's love of football and forged strong links in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and South Africa.

Martin O'Neill swiftly made him a marquee signing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/20/sunderland-manchester-city-adam-johnson\" title=\"\">taking him to the Stadium of Light for £10m</a>.</p><p>\"I loved it at City,\" Johnson said. \"It's a great club and but for the circumstances I would still be there now. You want to win medals and I did that there. Looking back, I would still have signed and would do it again.</p><p>\"Yes, I was disappointed the way it ended. I wanted to go and play more games. I was not asking to play every week – I knew I couldn't – I just asked to play one in four. It was as simple as that. I did not mind playing once every couple of weeks. It just wasn't a fair share. I was not expecting to play every minute of every game and I always knew that. It was just more the fact that it wasn't getting shared around enough. So I wanted to play somewhere I could play week in, week out and feel more loved.</p><p>\"With a different manager, who knows? I just wanted a little bit more game time. All I wanted was for everyone to be treated the same.</p><p>\"I think the fans at every club I've been involved with have loved me, it's more the managers having the trust in me playing. It wasn't always there.</p><p>\"Player after player after player was coming in and I was slowly going further and further backwards. That's what it's always going to be like at City, there's always going to be the next best thing coming in and I was going to get sold on again. It was always going to be a revolving door there, I think.\"</p><p>An element of reality was placed upon what had rapidly emerged into lauding of Johnson from certain quarters, from the England manager Roy Hodgson on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/luke-shaw-england-denmark-friendly-roy-hodgson\" title=\"\">Hodgson has not deemed the Sunderland man worthy of a place in his 30-man squad for the upcoming friendly against Denmark</a> which, by extension, means Johnson has a serious task on his hands to be named in England's party for this summer's World Cup. Given that Hodgson is hardly spoilt for choice, Johnson's omission despite seven goals in nine games was significant.</p><p>The reality is that recent history has taught us how Johnson's current burst of form could disappear just as quickly as it arrived. His prominence under Gus Poyet is no surprise, given Sunderland now have more players who display attacking intent than was previously the case. When Johnson was the sole creative force, he was identified as such by opposition managers and commonly double-marked out of games.</p><p>Still, it would only be wise to celebrate Johnson's touch for as long as it lasts. Poyet is due credit for bringing out the best in Johnson. \"I think it's just down to hard work, not just for me personally but the team has been working on all sorts of things; shape, tactics, defending off the ball and just slowly putting piece by piece together,\" Johnson explained.</p><p>\"Slowly that has started to show in our performances. We had the players so it was just about getting that out of us.</p><p>\"I think the manager has got us playing together better as a team and when you're playing better as a team the individuals come into the game more. We have had the ball a lot more than we have done in the last probably eight months. Under the gaffer we have controlled matches more than we've been controlled.\"</p><p>As a north-east boy from a Sunderland-obsessed family, Johnson is perfectly aware of the historic significance of this final appearance. He also understands the contrasting emotions on each side.</p><p>\"With City we were expected to win,\" he added. \"With Sunderland this year we're not. The fans of City are wanting that success every year, without doubt. They're disappointed if they're not winning two and three trophies. At Sunderland it's been amazing for us to get to the final full stop after so long. I think the fans are delighted.</p><p>\"I've seen texts and they're just delighted to be having a day out at Wembley. On the other hand, the City fans are expecting this now so it's different. It's a different sort of pressure.</p><p>\"Having been on both sides of it, we're going there with nothing to lose. We can go and play with freedom and try and win the game.

And yet it seems they also come to those who flail around wildly looking for the nearest handhold, regularly hurl the last six months of forward planning out of the window, and generally don't seem to be able to sit down for any period of time without jabbing themselves in the foot with the nearest sharp implement. For Sunderland, progress to Sunday's Capital One Cup final has involved not so much a cup run as a compelling kind of cup stampede, fraught with hierarchal change, a fast-paced turnover in playing staff and the continual clank-clank of gear-shift and about-turn.</p><p>Not that there is anything new in any of this. It is now four years since Ellis Short bought the club from the Drumaville Consortium, during which time Short's bafflingly incontinent administration has signed 42 players and sold 53, including 14 new signings from 10 different leagues in the past year alone. Four permanent managers have come and gone, along with three temporary ones, a disgruntled-looking Roy Keane, one fascism-related scandal, an improbable ginger-bearded director of football, and at least £200m of Short's own money in transfers and wages. From a distance the American private equity tycoon with a personal fortune of $3bn seems the most unlikely of accidental cup finalists, a man who has effectively blundered his way to Wembley in the past six months.</p><p>As ever in football the truth is a little less straightforward. Sunderland's mistakes have been obvious enough, given a sharper focus of late by a disastrous summer transfer window, the sacking of Paolo Di Canio and the departure in January of Roberto De Fanti, a personal acquaintance of Short appointed director of football last year who oversaw a string of hapless new&nbsp;signings.</p><p>Even now Sunderland's administration looks oddly callow and homemade, with only Short, a man who knows a great deal about money and a proportionately small amount about elite-level football in any coherent advisory capacity, and the chief executive, Margaret Byrne, above the manager, Gus Poyet.</p><p>In spite of which these mercurial Black Cats are currently halfway to performing a mid-air pirouette and landing back on their feet. Should Poyet's team beat Manchester City at Wembley and then, on the back of some encouraging recent momentum, edge themselves from 18th to 17th in the Premier League table in the next six weeks, a season that has at times seemed on the verge of meltdown could end up as one of the most memorable in Sunderland's postwar history.</p><p>Yet even within sight of an unlikely good news story there are still contradictions. The League Cup final itself arrives as a mixed mid-season blessing. Such have been the travails of recent winners it is even tempting to talk about the Curse of the Capital One. The holders, Swansea, won just one of their final 10 Premier League matches last season and have since sacked Michael Laudrup. Kenny Dalglish was sacked three months after winning it in 2012. Birmingham won it in 2011 and were relegated the same season. Spurs won it in 2008 and sacked Juande Ramos the same year. Chelsea won it under José Mourinho the year before that and were being managed by Avram Grant within six months.</p><p>For Sunderland the fear is naturally that success at Wembley might induce a release of tension at a vital stage in the Premier League season. And yet this in turn raises a broader question, the wider issue of what, exactly, the likes of Short are in this for anyway. Why do they do it, these otherwise rather sober entrepreneur-owners, stakeholders in what is a horribly fraught and emotive business?</p><p>It is tempting to compare owning a Premier League football club to owning an airline, a confusingly multifarious business that is on the face of it as much about prestige and status as any sensible notions of money-making. Sunderland's opponents at Wembley, Manchester City, have spent close to £1bn, with a return so far of a single FA Cup and that breathless last-day league title two years ago.</p><p>At Aston Villa Randy Lerner has consistently lost money, last year writing off loan repayments worth £20m. Liverpool's debt continues to rise, if not uncontrollably. And yet, as Short has discovered, owning a football club can also feel a bit like owning a house during a boom in the market. Sometimes no matter what you do to it, how many ill-fated schemes you set out on, how may walls you tear down and leave unfinished, it still just keeps on going up in value.</p><p>For all the lows of the last year a place in the Premier League remains a guarantee of hugely increased television revenues and ramped up shirt sponsorship deals. Helped by some chaotically productive wheeler dealing, and the Stadium of Light's second life as a concert venue for the likes of Coldplay and Bruce Springsteen, Sunderland managed to rake in £96.4m in total revenues last year, more than the Turkish champions, Galatasaray.</p><p>Against this, £100,000 for winning the Capital One Cup looks like small beer, as does the promised interference of a turn in the Europa League. Albeit, again the question of exactly what top-level football is for these days raises its head.</p><p>Short is the most hard-nosed of operators in his financial career, but there is a creeping, familiar sense – this is after all, English football – of a chairman who does at times seem to enjoy the high visibility benefits of life as a Premier League chairman, who separately owns the Scottish celebrity haunt Skibo Castle, revels in his face-to-face encounters with Sunderland's fans, and who was recently in the news for leaving a £1,800 tip while dining out in a city centre curry house after the win over Everton.</p><p>Not that Short does not deserve to enjoy himself a little after the rigours of early season. In particular the appointment of Poyet has been a clear success so far, an indication once again of how in football one good decision can draw a veil over a bucket-load of wrong turns. Sunderland's manager has this week gone from saying he would always choose Premier League survival over winning the League Cup to a state of obvious excitement ahead of Sunday's final.</p><p>Short was something of a lone cheerleader for Poyet before his appointment, but the Uruguayan's energy, his commitment to the club, and a run of recent victories have threatened to recalibrate Sunderland's season: post-Wembley they have six winnable home matches in the league, to go alongside away games at&nbsp;Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea and Manchester United.</p><p>If victory against City's heavyweights remains an unlikely prospect, Sunderland have won four and drawn two of the last eight matches between the two, and lost just once in the last five. They have a goalkeeper in fine form, a former City winger in Adam Johnson with seven goals in his last nine matches and opponents who might, just, have their eyes set on broader horizons.</p><p>For all that, this is still Sunderland, a club apparently set this season on taking the path of most resistance. One thing seems certain. It is unlikely to be dull.</p>","headline":"Sunderland's Ellis Short hopes for cup final defeat of Manchester City","trailText":"<strong>Barney Ronay:</strong> After a weird season on Wearside Sunderland's owner has a glimpse of Wembley glory in the Capital One Cup final","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393622138422/Sunderlands-owner-Ellis-S-006.jpg","wordcount":"1180","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-03T22:30:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/28/sunderland-gus-poyet-manchester-city-capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2014/feb/28/sunderland-gus-poyet-manchester-city-capital-one-cup","tags":[{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/barneyronay","webTitle":"Barney Ronay","r2ContributorId":"21010","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/12/barney_ronay_140x140.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733869/BarneyRonay.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Barney Ronay is senior sports writer for guardian.co.uk.

The squad will train on Saturday  morning before travelling to London in the afternoon and the manager could still have a change of mind. However, if Hart does not start, it would be another blow following the loss of his place to Pantilimon during the autumn.</p><p>The 26-year-old has spoken for the first time regarding that decision by Pellegrini and admitted he had to take it on the chin. \"You have to be able to accept when you are playing or not,\" he told the BBC's Football Focus. \"When managers have got decisions to make, whether it benefits me or not, I have to be man enough to take it. I work hard every day to win and I understand it doesn't always go my way and you have to move forward.\"</p><p>Pantilimon, who was dropped by Roberto Mancini for last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/11/manchester-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup\" title=\"\">FA Cup final defeat by Wigan Athletic</a> after playing in all the previous rounds, would not be drawn on whether he will appear against Sunderland. \"Only the manager can say this. I'm like all the players, we are waiting for this,\" he said. \"We don't know what the team is going to be. The manager decides on the day of the game the first XI.\"</p><p>City are clear favourites against Sunderland but Samir Nasri has twice lost cup finals at Wembley to unfancied teams who went on to be relegated, as Gus Poyet's third-bottom side could also be. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/27/arsenal-birmingham-city-carling-cup-final\" title=\"\">Nasri was in the Arsenal team defeated by Birmingham City</a> after a late Obafemi Martins goal in the 2011 League Cup final. The Frenchman was also in the City XI beaten by Wigan, again to a late goal, from Ben Watson.</p><p>Asked which was the more disappointing reverse, Nasri said: \"I cannot choose one of them over the other. The only thing is I lost two finals against teams who went down. It hurts because you play to win trophies and it was a good opportunity to win this trophy. \"</p><p>Arsenal and City had been favourites ahead of the respective final losses. \"Yes, that is really difficult,\" said Nasri. \"You go back home and play the game again in your head and it's difficult.\"</p><p>Wigan's victory came against the backdrop of uncertainty over the future of Mancini but Nasri denied this was a factor. \"It is not nice to say it is about the manager,\" he said. \"I just think we didn't play our football. You have some days when you cannot perform well and that's what happened.</p><p>\"I am not in the head of every player but I cannot say it is the manager's fault. He made his choices, you have to respect them. On the pitch you have to give everything and, to be honest, Wigan were really difficult to play. They play 3-5-2, sometimes 5-3-2 so it was really difficult to play them and they had good players as well.\"</p><p>Pellegrini should be able to choose Sergio Agüero, after his recovery from a hamstring injury. The striker, who has scored 26 goals in 25 games this season, has not featured since 29 January but has had a full week of training since rejoining the squad on Tuesday.</p><p>In Agüero's absence Álvaro Negredo has hit the first lean spell of his debut season. The Spaniard has 23 goals for City but has not scored since 21 January. While Negredo was suffering from a shoulder injury for part of this sequence, he believes Agüero's return will help him rediscover his scoring touch.</p><p>\"We've done well together earlier in the season, we got a lot of goals so maybe that can continue,\" he said. \"All the forwards we have here are good players. I like playing alongside any of them. But Agüero is one of the top strikers around and it will be fantastic to have him back.\"</p><p>Negredo said of his drought: \"For the first few games I was struggling with my shoulder. It was an influence for a couple of weeks after it happened but I'm perfectly fine now. As strikers we go through cycles when sometimes the goals stop coming but I am not worried. They will come back. It's been a few weeks now so I hope so.\"</p>","headline":"Manchester City's Joe Hart to miss out on cup final against Sunderland","trailText":"The England goalkeeper will take a place on the substitutes' bench with Costel Pantilimon set to start at Wembley","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393615004409/Joe-Hart-002.jpg","wordcount":"736","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-03T22:30:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/28/manchester-city-joe-hart-sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/feb/28/manchester-city-joe-hart-sunderland","tags":[{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchestercity","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}]},{"id":"football/sunderland","webTitle":"Sunderland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/sunderland","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"}]},{"id":"football/capital-one-cup","webTitle":"Capital One Cup","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/capital-one-cup","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/capital-one-cup","references":[{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jamiejackson","webTitle":"Jamie Jackson","r2ContributorId":"19396","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/11/11/jamiejacks.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jamie Jackson is the Manchester football correspondent for the Guardian and Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jamiejackson","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/39"},{"type":"pa-football-competition","id":"pa-football-competition/301"},{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/11"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-431005854","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393615004409/Joe-Hart-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Action Images","photographer":"Craig Brough","altText":"Joe Hart","height":"84","credit":"Craig Brough/Action Images","caption":"Manchester City's Joe Hart has accepted he will not start in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday.
