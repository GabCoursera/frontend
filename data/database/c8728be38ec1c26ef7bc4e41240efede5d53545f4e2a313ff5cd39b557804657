When&nbsp;Inspector Morse was in his late 20s, he looked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jan/01/endeavour-inspector-morse\" title=\"\">a lot like the actor Shaun Evans</a>.

Creator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Dexter\" title=\"\">Colin Dexter</a> has made it as clear as&nbsp;possible that Evans, star of the 60s-set ITV prequel series Endeavour, will be the last actor ever to play Morse.</p><p><strong>How has he managed that? </strong>By writing a clause in&nbsp;his will forbidding anyone else from playing the detective.</p><p><strong>Really? </strong>Yes. Evans had hinted at the clause in an&nbsp;interview with the Radio Times, and now <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-morse-code-no-other-actors-will-be-allowed-to-play-colin-dexters-detective-after-the-late-john-thaw-9213246.html\" title=\"\">the&nbsp;Independent has confirmed it</a>. \"A lot of people connected with Morse didn't want anyone coming along to say we will try to outdo dear old John,\" Dexter revealed. \"I said I'm not ever going to allow that, full stop.\"</p><p><strong>So this is because John Thaw was such a good Morse that nobody can compete?</strong> That's exactly it. Thaw was the definitive Morse. Grumpy, crossword-fixated, drunk, slightly misogynistic, pedantic about grammar.</p><p><strong>It's a shame that we will never get to see what&nbsp;he&nbsp;would be like in the year 2014.</strong> I know. With those characteristics, he'd be really good at&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p><strong>That's it for ever, then. No more Morse.</strong> Well, not&nbsp;for a while at least. The clause is expected to be enforced by Dexter's estate, which retains the rights for only 70 years after his death.</p><p><strong>Then there's still hope!</strong> Oh God. Hope for what?</p><p><strong>Hope for me to achieve my dream of producing a&nbsp;new Inspector Morse series, set almost exactly 70 years in the future.</strong> Don't do this.</p><p><strong>Just imagine it. A bold reimagining of Inspector Morse, in which he raps and flies hoverboards and shoots lasers out of his eyes and is played&nbsp;by&nbsp;the day's nearest possible equivalent to Justin Bieber. Also, Lewis is a robot now. A&nbsp;lady robot!

Limbaugh remains more famous for his&nbsp;bilious attacks on \"leftwing\" politicians and institutions. <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/02/rush-limbaugh-vs-the-pope/comment-page-169/\" title=\"\">He recently branded the pope's economic views as \"pure Marxism\"</a>.</p><p><strong>That seems a little crazy.</strong> He once said: \"We exhale CO2. If it were a poison, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;part of the way we stay alive.\"</p><p><strong>And this idiot writes children's books?</strong> Yup. Rush&nbsp;is the author of two books for kids, Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims and Rush Revere and the First Patriots.</p><p><strong>Who is Rush Revere? </strong>He's a freedom-loving, time-travelling supply teacher with a talking horse named Liberty.</p><p><strong>Uh-huh. </strong>And he looks just like Rush Limbaugh, or&nbsp;rather the colonial-costumed caricature of Limbaugh that graces the labels of <a href=\"http://www.twoifbytea.com/\" title=\"\">a brand of iced tea he promotes</a>.</p><p><strong>I see.</strong> And Rush Revere goes back in time to meet the historical figures who made America the single greatest country in the history of the world.</p><p><strong>He sounds like a jerk. </strong>He's very popular. The first book, published in October, <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/03/20/rush_revere_books_will_be_1_and_4_on_the_new_york_times_best_seller_list\" title=\"\">is still on the New York Times children's bestseller list</a>.</p><p><strong>Be honest – are the books any good?</strong> Kids seem&nbsp;to&nbsp;like them – and Amazon reviews are overwhelmingly positive – but some critics have questioned their accuracy.</p><p><strong>Include me in that. Horses can't talk. </strong>Last week&nbsp;Limbaugh was named as <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/20/rush-limbaugh-childrens-book-selection-causes-a-stir/\" title=\"\">one of four finalists for book of the year at the Children's and Teen Choice Book Awards</a>.</p><p><strong>And what rabid rightwing pressure group is behind that prize?</strong> The Children's Book Council. It's sort of a nonprofit trade association.</p><p><strong>What did it think was so great about Limbaugh's book?</strong> Nothing. The finalists are determined by sales figures.</p><p><strong>Really? I was all set to be angry with someone on social media. Now I don't know what to do. </strong>Maybe you could go for a run or something.</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"I suppose it doesn't matter if it's corny&nbsp;jingoistic propaganda, as long as it gets kids&nbsp;reading.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"To the time portal, Liberty! Let's go kick Karl Marx's fat red ass!\"</p>","headline":"Rush Limbaugh: rightwing talkshow host to bestselling children's author","trailText":"He's no friend of those on the political left, but he knows how to woo kids.
