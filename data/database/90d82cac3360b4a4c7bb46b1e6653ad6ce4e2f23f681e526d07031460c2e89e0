However, there is plenty of free software that will locate and remove malware hiding in Windows</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<blockquote><p>I use the Firefox web browser with Adblock, and I run AVG anti-virus. Frequently, but not always, when I click on a link in a Google search result, it takes me to a page advertising something instead of going to the page indicated. If I go back to the search results and click the same link, it usually goes to the correct site. I thought this might be malware, but I have scanned with AVG and Malwarebytes, including anti-rootkit, and there is no indication of anything wrong. Researching the problem, I came across concerns that the Chrome browser could have this behaviour, and the suggestion was to disable extensions. I’m not very happy to do this because my various Firefox extensions add functionality I value. <b>Geoff</b></p></blockquote><p>Google’s Chrome browser has been having problems with something known as the chrome-navigation-error.info redirect, which may be botnet related. This also seems to afflict Apple Mac OS X users and apparently some Linux users, but not Firefox users. Either way, it’s not your problem.</p><p>Usually, the best way to tackle malware is to identify it, so that you can search for specific solutions. In this case, you’re not sure if your PC has any malware, and you haven’t identified it, so we will have to take a generic approach. This isn’t a bad thing. The danger is that an attacker can use a small security hole to install more malignant software, so it’s best to give your PC a thorough inspection.</p><p>Before you start, make sure you have all your programs and data backed up, and that you can restore Windows to its factory condition if necessary. Your PC probably has a hidden recovery partition that will do this. It’s also a good idea to make a restore copy of Windows on DVD as well. Your PC may well prompt you to do this each time you restart it.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are several ways of redirecting search traffic, so we can’t even be certain that Firefox is the problem. It could be something to do with your Hosts file (though it probably isn’t), with a rootkit on your hard drive, or with a “poisoned” domain name service (DNS). Some redirections are the result of websites being hacked, and in these cases, there’s nothing wrong with the user’s PC.</p><h2>Preparations</h2><p>Start by making a list of your useful Firefox extensions and then uninstalling and re-installing Firefox. Make sure you download the new version from https://www.mozilla.org/ (note the https for security). <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/\">This link</a> takes you to a page where you can download all the localised versions from Acholi to Xhosa, including “English (British)”.</p><p>Don’t use Google to search for this kind of thing: it is targeted by scammers and it is far too easy to be duped by the adverts that Google puts above search results. As when searching for visa, health card and similar application forms, use the <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine, which doesn’t track you and also protects your privacy.</p><p>Does your new, guaranteed-legitimate version of Firefox still have a redirection problem? If not, you can start to install the extensions you need. You could start with <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-edge/\">Adblock Edge</a> – a forked version of Adblock Plus – and then install one extension per day. Don’t install a new extension until you’re sure the last one is OK.</p><p>Next, replace your Hosts file, since one of its purposes is to redirect websites. I recommend the <a href=\"http://msmvps.com/blogs/hostsnews/default.aspx\">MVPS Hosts</a> file created by a group of Microsoft-designated Most Valuable Professionals (they’re not employees). This also works on non-Windows systems. Follow the <a href=\"http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts2.htm\">instructions</a> to install it, bearing in mind that you must have Administrator access.</p><p>Finally, in this section, download <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/minitoolbox/\">Farbar’s MiniToolBox</a> from Bleeping Computer. This can detect and fix problems with proxy settings and search redirects, hijacked routers and so on. You don’t need to install MiniToolBox, it just runs. In this case, tick the boxes for Flush DNS, Reset IE Proxy Settings, and Reset FF Proxy Settings, then click Go.</p><p>Problem solved? If not, it’s time to play hunt the malware…</p><h2>Malware removal</h2><p>In general, I’ve found that running <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.org/free/\">Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a> in Safe Mode is the quickest way to remove malware that has evaded whichever anti-virus program you have installed. Start by saving the free MBAM to your desktop, updating its detection database, and running a quick scan. Remove any malware it finds, but don’t stop there. Reboot your PC and keep pressing F8 before Windows loads, to bring up the boot menu (some PCs may use a different hotkey). When you get the boot menu, select Safe Mode, and run Malwarebytes again. If it finds any malware, delete it and repeat the process. Keep rebooting and re-running Malwarebytes until it doesn’t find anything bad.</p><p>You’ve already tried Malwarebytes so you may want to try an alternative such as <a href=\"https://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.aspx\">Norton Power Eraser</a>. It’s another program that targets the sort of stuff that everyday anti-virus programs might miss, and it targets “scamware” in particular. Symantec warns that it is aggressive and may detect threats in legitimate programs, but at this stage, a bit of aggression is a good idea.</p><p>If Malwarebytes and/or NPE don’t find your malware, there are a few more targeted programs you can run. The ones worth trying include – in order – Bleeping Computer’s RKill, Kaspersky Lab’s TDSSKiller, SurfRight’s HitmanPro, and Xplode’s AdwCleaner. RKill tries to kill any known-bad processes running on your PC, which may be preventing other programs from running or finding malware. TDSSKiller finds rootkits. You can download all of these from <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/windows/\">Bleeping Computer’s Downloads section</a>. There are also lots of <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/\">tutorials</a> on the site to explain how to do things.</p><p>When everything else fails, there’s ComboFix. This has been developed by Bleeping Computer to tackle hard problems, and is used by many other anti-malware forums. However, unless you’re an expert, it’s not something you should run yourself. You should create an account at Bleeping Computer (or a similar website such as <a href=\"http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/forum/37-virus-spyware-malware-removal/\">Geeks To Go</a>), select the correct forum for your problem, and start a new query as explained in the <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/welcome-guide/\">Welcome Guide</a>. One of the site’s volunteers will try to help you to find a solution. This will often involve running RKill and ComboFix and posting logs from your PC, but you need to be familiar with the area to make sense of the logs.</p><h2>Updating Windows</h2><p>Malware is relatively rare on Windows nowadays, at least since we all stopped using 32-bit Windows XP – I’ve not found any on my 64-bit Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8 in more than half a decade of running multiple machines. However, that’s mainly because I keep Windows and all my other software up to date. I run <a href=\"http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/\">Secunia’s Personal Software Inspector </a>(PSI), which does a weekly scan, and I check Windows Update manually, often after Microsoft auto-installs updates on “Patch Tuesday”. I also minimise the amount of Adobe, Apple and Java code on my Windows PCs, though they all have Adobe Flash installed.</p><p>Microsoft’s SmartScreen filter has also helped a lot. When you run a new program, SmartScreen creates an SHA-256 hash of the executable code and sends this gibberish to a Microsoft server, which looks to see if the same hash is associated with any malware. If it is, it blocks the code or website and puts up a message to say that “Windows protected your PC”. Importantly, it provides protection against social engineering attacks (eg fake codec updates) and drive-by downloads. SmartScreen has been part of Internet Explorer but is now plumbed into Windows 8. Yes, it has some privacy implications, but they’re nothing like as bad as downloading anything from the Windows Store, iTunes, Google Play or a similar service.</p><p>You don’t have to be perfect. Most malware writers target the “low hanging fruit” represented by the hundreds of millions of users who never install patches, run pirate copies of software with built-in back doors, or are still using Windows XP. Being up to date will not save you from a professional attack from the National Security Agency, GCHQ and other organisations with access to unknown or zero-day exploits, but unless you’re a potential target, you’re very unlikely to fall victim to one of those.</p>","headline":"How can I remove redirection malware from my PC?","trailText":"Some of Geoff’s Google search results are being redirected to ad sites, but he doesn’t know how.

Also on the home network are a couple of former XP machines now running Windows 8.1 (used by my daughters for homework), various mobile devices (mostly Android), a smart TV, Raspberry Pi etc. My main concerns are adding more storage capacity and automating backups, as I am not good at doing that regularly. I’m not really bothered about media streaming, but may want to do that in the future.</p><p>The obvious solution seems to be to add a NAS, which could be done fairly cheaply using something like the D-Link DSN-327L, but I’m also wondering about the Home Server option – something like Asus Home Server. <b>Iain</b></p></blockquote><p>A NAS (Network Attached Storage) box is not only the obvious solution, it’s the best solution. I wouldn’t recommend buying an Asus Home Server or similar device at this point, though current users have no need to change: it’s exceptionally easy to use. The first problem is that Microsoft announced that Home Server 2011 would be the last. The second problem is that Microsoft dropped a feature everyone liked, which was the ability to expand a Windows Home Server by plugging in external hard drives.</p><p>A NAS is basically a computer with the slowest processor and smallest memory that the manufacturer can get away with, but has bays to hold from one to four hard drives. Most run a small version of Linux because it’s very reliable, runs on cheap ARM chips, and is free. The NAS connects directly to your Wi-Fi router, not your PC, and is always on. Everyone in the house can load, stream or store files when they need them, usually via Wi-Fi.</p><p>When you buy a NAS, you’re paying for the box, processor, memory, disk controllers and software. Normally, you’d buy one, two or four separate hard drives to slot into the empty drive bays, depending on how much storage you need. Every NAS should come with software that can automatically back up PCs. But remember, it’s only a backup if you have at least two copies. If you are buying a NAS to free up space on your main PC, then you will only have one copy, and you will need another backup.</p><h2>What about RAID?</h2><p>A long time ago and far away, mainframes and minicomputers used very big, expensive hard drives. Someone had the idea of replacing them with arrays of small, cheap hard drives designed for personal computers. The drawback was that these cheap drives were relatively unreliable, and if you were installing 40 or 80 at a time, one or two would fail. If failures interrupted the server or lost data, that was very bad news indeed. The solution was to mirror data between pairs of drives, or stripe data across multiple drives. That halved the storage capacity, but it didn’t matter because cheap is cheap. The result was RAID, for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks.</p><p>However, I don’t think RAID is suitable for home users.</p><p>The first problem is that RAID is a way of keeping servers running: it’s not a backup system. If a member of your family accidentally deletes the 500GB folder of irreplaceable home movies, then the NAS will merrily delete the same folder on the mirrored drive to keep them in sync. The only advantage of a RAID 1 mirrored backup is that your data survives if one of the hard drives fails, which is just the same as having a backup on a much cheaper external hard drive.</p><p>The second problem is that RAID means putting all your eggs in one basket, which is the worst way to back stuff up. If your NAS gets fried by a freak power overload, nicked by a passing thief or goes up in flames with the rest of your house, then you have lost your originals and the backups simultaneously. When devising a backup strategy, think about storing files on different devices, or different media (DVD or Blu-ray?), in different places. For really important data, you should have a backup “off site” or in the cloud.</p><h2>Buying a box</h2><p>When it comes to buying a box, Synology is a specialist NAS supplier and has the best reputation at the moment, along with QNAP. Its products are not the cheapest, but they are not particularly expensive either. The entry-level Synology DS214se 2-Bay Desktop NAS Enclosure currently costs <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00FWURI8K/\">£120 at Amazon.co.uk</a>, and you can add a 3TB WD Red (not Green) OEM hard drive for £95.99. A more powerful <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Synology-DS213J-Bay-Desktop-Enclosure/dp/B00CDG2XHC/\">DS213J</a> costs £180. You can <a href=\"https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/compare_products/DS214se/DS214play/DS213j\">compare different models</a> on the Synology website.</p><p>I hadn’t heard of the D-Link DSN-327L until you mentioned it, and it is remarkably cheap – <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/D-Link-ShareCenter-Network-Storage-Enclosure/dp/B008HNRD4I/\">£53.48 at Amazon</a> – though it only has an 800MHz processor and 128MB of memory. It’s one of number of devices offering “home cloud” services to consumers – Western Digital owns the My Cloud name, while LaCie uses CloudBox – and will probably do all you need. However, the reviewer at <a href=\"http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/network-storage/1304554/d-link-sharecenter-dns-327l\">Expert Reviews</a> still reckons Synology is a better buy. <a href=\"http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/storage-appliances/386743/synology-diskstation-ds214play\">PC Pro</a>‘s top pick is the Synology DS214play, which has an I<a href=\"http://blog.synology.com/blog/?p=624\">ntel Atom and USB 3</a>.</p><p>In general, a more powerful NAS is needed to handle more simultaneous users, including media streaming, background torrenting or even hosting a website. You may not need these features at the moment, but you have enough devices to generate demand.</p><p>How big a NAS do you need? The rule of thumb is to add up all the storage on all your family’s devices – PCs, tablets, smartphones etc – and double it. That’s the minimum. However, you can skip that and just decide how many 3TB drives you need. They only cost a little more than 2TB drives, and they are more reliable than 4TB drives. Also, 4TB drives don’t work in all NAS boxes, and that includes the DSN-327L. I suspect you’ll need two, but only just, so 6TB will give you plenty of headroom.</p><p>There are alternatives to buying a NAS. For example, you could build one yourself, or re-purpose an old tower PC that has enough bays to hold several hard drives. You can use free software such as <a href=\"http://www.amahi.org/\">Amahi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freenas.org/\">FreeNAS</a> or <a href=\"http://www.openmediavault.org/\">Open Media Vault</a>. Indeed, you could even use an old Windows PC, accessing shared folders with software such as <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&amp;hl=en\">ES File Explorer for Android</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol\">RDP</a>. However, you won’t save much money, and usually the running costs will be higher, because they consume more power. On simplicty, convenience and price, the off-the-shelf NAS is hard to beat.</p>","headline":"Which NAS should I buy to store files?","trailText":"Iain has filled his PC’s hard drive and wants to move files to a storage system that the rest of the family can access from PCs and various mobile devices.

too expensive?","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-28T16:47:45Z","sectionName":"Technology","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/askjack/2014/feb/28/are-windows-8-tablets-too-expensive","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3n6q5","standfirst":"<p>Brian is sick of Android and is wavering between a Windows 8 tablet and an iPad Mini</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<blockquote><p>I’m looking for a good 7in or 8in tablet, and I don’t know what to do. It doesn’t have to have a super-duper HD retina display or Dolby sound. I use it mainly for Microsoft Exchange email, browsing, watching the occasional BBC video or live news etc, and running a few apps. I’m not a gamer.</p><p>Currently, I’m using a Kindle Fire to fill the gap, but it’s very limited both in terms of capabilities (what can be installed) and grunt.</p><p>I have bought four Android tablets -- a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (Wi-Fi/3g) in 2011 and three Google Nexus 7 tablets, including new and old models -- and they have all had problems. This year I tried another 2012 Nexus 7. All was well for a few days until Android updated to KitKat (4.4.2 KOT49H), when I started having exactly the same touch screen problems as I had had with both 2013 units. Having frequently suffered from things being broken by Android updates, this has just made me sick of Android.</p><p>I thought perhaps of a Windows 8 (not RT) tablet. I like the idea of being able to run some of my desktop software on a tablet, but they are just too expensive.</p><p>I also did something I thought I’d never do -- consider an Apple device -- so I’ve been reading up on the iPad Mini. The old model is now going for around £215, and I don’t really want to go too much higher. However, I’m not a fan of the Apple “closed” system or having iTunes installed: years ago it completely trashed my PC. Also, when I tried an iPad Mini in John Lewis, the video clips on the BBC News website wouldn’t play. The sales assistant told me the only way to watch BBC videos was by using the BBC News app, which curiously didn’t work.<b> Brian</b></p></blockquote><p>I’m tempted to suggest a BlackBerry tablet as that may be the only one you haven’t tried, and they are very cheap. However, the fact is that Android is the only real choice in the cheap tablet market (£50-£200) apart from Amazon’s Kindle Fire, and you already have one of those. Also, it’s not much of an alternative in the sense that it uses a forked version of the open source part of Android, without the proprietary Google layer that provides access to Google Play etc.</p><p>When it comes to choosing between an Apple iPad and a Windows 8 tablet, they are different beasts with different capabilities. You’d usually choose an iPad to get access to the vast selection of high-quality apps, which have actually been designed for tablets rather than phones. You’d usually choose a Windows 8 tablet because it provides access to the vast selection of Windows programs. The Windows Store now has about 240,000 tablet apps and covers most needs, but it’s still nowhere near the iPad’s ecosystem.</p><p>I don’t think there’s actually much difference in terms of ease of use in tablet mode, once you have learned the specific edge-swipes that do special things in the Metro-sorry-modern interface. (If you won’t learn those, you have no chance.) Most of the complaints about Windows 8 have been about using the tablet interface to access desktop features, and Microsoft is in the process of fixing those.</p><p>I’ve been using a Haswell-powered Surface Pro 2 on loan from Microsoft, and while it has many improvements over the first version, the experience hasn’t really changed the views I expressed when I reviewed it here (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/23/microsoft-surface-pro-review\">Microsoft Surface Pro review: a device of many talents</a>). It’s amazingly versatile. For example, you can use it as a desktop with full size keyboard and monitor -- or several monitors -- and its Wacom-style pen-operated graphics make it exceptionally good value for creative types. It also makes life simpler when you can do PC-level photo and video editing then switch to tablet-style viewing on the same machine. It’s dramatically cheaper than buying a desktop, an Ultrabook, a graphics tablet, and a tablet. On the other hand, it’s not the optimum choice for any particular function, and if you don’t need all the features, it’s an expensive option.</p><p>It’s true that Windows 8 tablet hybrids can cost from about £350 to over £1,000, but new tablets with 8in screens are very much cheaper, and prices now start at about £250. (Or, for American buyers, about $250.) They can still do all the good stuff, such as supporting multiple monitors, though usually without the high-resolution digitising pen input. The obvious drawback is that an 8in screen is very small for running desktop programs, especially if you don’t know them well enough to use keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>The cost savings come from the smaller screen sizes and the use of 32-bit Intel Atom chips with 2GB of memory. However, the new Bay Trail chips are dramatically better than the old Atoms used in netbooks. For example, the Z3770 is roughly as fast as an Intel Celeron 1007U or a low-voltage Core i3-4010Y, and ahead of old staples such as the second-gen Core i3-2375M. Of course, the extra efficiency of Windows 8 helps as well.</p><h2>Cheaper Windows?</h2><p>There may be further price reductions to come, both through economies of scale -- production is still ramping up -- and because Microsoft might cut the price of Windows 8 on ultra low cost PCs.</p><p>You may know that netbooks were cheap partly because Microsoft offered manufacturers a special version of Windows XP called Home Edition ULCPC for “ultra low cost personal computers”. The rumoured price was closer to $15 than the usual $45, but it was basically free money for Microsoft -- XP had reached the end of its very profitable life -- and netbook manufacturers preferred it to free Linux. Today, the competition is with free Android, and Microsoft is willing to cut the price because it wants to sell more copies of Windows 8. (And it needs to sell more Windows 8 tablets to encourage developers to write more apps for the Windows Store.)</p><p>Anyway, on February 22, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-22/microsoft-said-to-cut-windows-price-70-to-counter-rivals.html\">Bloomberg</a> reported: “Manufacturers will be charged $15 to license Windows 8.1 and preinstall it on devices that retail for less than $250, instead of the usual fee of $50, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details aren’t public. The discount will apply to any products that meet the price limit, with no restrictions on the size or type of device, the people said.”</p><p>Currently there are exactly zero Windows 8.1 devices designed to retail for less than $250 (though you might get one in a sale), so if the story is true, Microsoft is trying to penetrate a part of the market that now goes by default to Android devices and low-end Chromebooks in the $199.99 to $249.99 price range.</p><h2>Windows 8 mini-tablets</h2><p>If you fancy trying an 8in Windows 8 tablet, there are several to choose from. The notable ones include the Dell Venue 8 Pro, Toshiba Encore, Acer Iconia W4, Lenovo MiiX 2 and Asus VivoTab Note 8.</p><p>The cheapest I can see at the moment is a <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/laptops-netbooks/ipad-tablets-and-ereaders/tablets/toshiba-encore-8-tablet-32-gb-21780568-pdt.html\">Toshiba Encore 8</a> with 32GB of storage on sale (£50 off) for £199.99 at PC World. This has micro-USB and micro HDMI ports so you could plug it into a monitor or TV set, and apparently includes £100-worth of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013. This is the same price as a Nexus 7 and cheaper than your discounted iPad Mini, without even counting the extra cost of Apple cables.</p><p>The rule of thumb is that 32GB on Windows tablets is equivalent to 16GB on Android and iPad tablets, but you can improve on that using tips from this <a href=\"http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/dell/60268-guide-maximizing-disk-space-your-dell-venue-8-pro-other-windows-8-1-system.html\">Guide to Maximizing Disk Space on your Dell Venue 8 Pro (or other Windows 8.1 system</a>). The standard tricks include copying off the Recovery platform, which saves 5GB or 6GB, and mounting a fast 64GB SD card as Permanent Storage.</p><p>I have nothing against the iPad Mini: when I had one on loan from Apple, I liked it a lot and gave it a five-star review. It played BBC videos perfectly, and colours looked more naturalistic than they did on a Kindle Fire. Also, if you want access to the iPad ecosystem, it’s the cheapest option. However, a Windows tablet will do the tablety things you need, and it will enable you to RDP into your desktop PC, and stream videos via an Xbox, if you have one. It will also run Adobe Flash and standard desktop PC software using a PC or wireless Bluetooth keyboard. And you won’t be forced to install iTunes.</p>","headline":"Are Windows 8 tablets too expensive?","trailText":"Brian is sick of Android and is wavering between a Windows 8 tablet and an iPad Mini.

I won’t have access to a computer, so what can I buy that will show my photos?</i><br><b></b></p><p><b>Christine</b></p><p>Does your camera have an HDMI or, more likely, a micro HDMI port? If so, you can connect it to an HDTV set using a micro HDMI cable. There are dozens available on shopping sites such as Amazon, and you should be able to find one on the high street. I’m assuming all the guests will be able to gather round a TV set, but you can ask your hosts about that. It’s more likely than getting them all to sit around a laptop or tablet.</p><p>You can select a series of photos, copy them to a separate folder on your PC, edit and renumber the copies, then move them to an empty SD card (or whatever type of memory card your camera uses). With luck, they will show in the right order.</p><p>You must try these things at home first. Trying to debug technical problems in unknown equipment while under time pressure is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>A camera isn’t the best device for controlling a slide show. However, if you have a laptop or tablet with an HDMI port, you can do much the same thing. If not, you could buy a cheapish Android tablet with a micro HDMI port and use the cable that you would have used with the camera. If your hosts don’t have an HDTV set, you can still show your photos on the tablet, though they won’t have as much impact on the smaller screen.</p><h2>Make a movie</h2><p>If you are willing to do more work on your presentation beforehand, you can make it simpler to show pictures. For example, most video-editing programs will turn a series of still images into a short movie, with fades and other transitions (or not) between slides, plus background music if you want it. Once you’re happy with your production, you can save it to a USB thumb drive or burn it to a CD or DVD, depending on what your hosts have available. You could even email it to them, and let them figure out how to show it.</p><p>You could make your movie using the free <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/get-movie-maker-download\">Windows Live Movie Maker </a>(WLMM) or Apple’s iMovie, and there are lots of YouTube videos that will take you through the process. The main thing to watch out for is the file format. You must “publish” the movie to convert it from a project (wimp) into a single file, but that file must be one that your playback device can handle. Microsoft has tried to simplify things by giving <a href=\"http://createvideonotebook.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/new-export-options-for-windows-live.html\">options</a> such as Feature phone (small), Apple iPhone, Android tablet (1080p) etc, but you can create custom settings. Most non-Apple devices can handle avi and wmv movies, but if you save it to your Windows PC, it should save it in standard H.264/MP4 format.</p><p>Windows Live Movie Maker also lets you publish your movie straight to YouTube, in which case your hosts could stream it on a smart TV set, if they have one.</p><h2>Digital picture frames</h2><p>If TV sets, CD/DVD players and laptops are all out of the question, then you could resort to a digital picture frame. There are dozens of models available, with screen sizes typically between 7in and 15in, though some are larger. They’re cheap, with models that have remote controls starting at about £30. Unfortunately, manufacturers still think 800 x 600 pixels is “high resolution”. Also, watch out: some models will only show photos in random order, and the specifications don’t make that clear. However, most will also play movies. For example, the high-end <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Braun-1350-Resolution-Digiframe-Picture/dp/B00813LMAK/\">Braun 1350 DigiFrame</a> – a 13.3in model that weighs 1.01kg – will play the MPEG1/2/4, AV1, M-JPEG, and H.264 movie formats. All you’d need to make it go is a mains plug.</p><h2>Pico projectors</h2><p>People who hanker after the days of my youth – when I had a proper 35mm slide projector and screen – might be tempted by the idea of a “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_st?keywords=pico+projector&amp;qid=1392868774&amp;rh=n%3A560798%2Ck%3Apico+projector&amp;sort=salesrank\">pico projector</a>“. These are reasonably cheap and work quite well in the dark. However, most of them simply take a feed from a laptop or similar source, and you’d be dependent on your hosts having a clear white wall to project on. General Imaging’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/General-Imaging-Ipico-Projector-iPhone/dp/B008OPTQ76/\">Ipico</a> is one of the smallest, and is designed to work with an Apple iPhone or iPod. It might be worth buying if you have other uses for it, but not for a one-off event.</p><h2>Going wireless</h2><p>You should definitely take an HDMI cable to the dinner party, but there may be an alternative in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance\">DLNA</a> (Digital Living Network Alliance). This is an industry standard based on UPnP (Universal Plug and Play), and dates back to 2003. DNLA transfers data between devices, so if the house has a Wi-Fi network, then you can send pictures to a DLNA-compatible TV set. Most are, nowadays. Not all have built-in Wi-Fi, but you can sometimes get round this by using an intermediate device that’s already plugged into the TV set, such as a games console.</p><p>An even newer option is to buy a Miracast HDMI dongle, which uses both DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct. You plug the dongle into the TV set – making both USB and HDMI connections – and it connects directly to your Miracast device without going via the router. It works just like an HDMI cable, with the TV screen mirroring what’s on the smartphone, tablet or laptop screen. Miracast devices should be tested and certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, which also turned the IEEE 802.11 standards into usable Wi-Fi. But I’d leave this one for a while until things settle down. (By the way, Apple doesn’t support either the DLNA or Miracast standards: it uses its own proprietary Airplay system.)</p><h2>Choosing a tablet</h2><p>The final choice is, of course, up to you. If you’re looking to buy something, then I’d lean towards the Android tablet solution. If you can’t use an HDMI cable or Wi-Fi/DLNA network to display your photos on a TV screen, tablets are easy to hold up and pass around. This could also be a reasonably cheap solution, since a 7in <a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/direct/hudl/\">Tesco Hudl</a> will do the job: it has both a microSD card slot and a microHDMI port for £119. Obviously, a high-resolution 10in tablet like the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/nexus/10/\">Google Nexus 10</a> would provide a better viewing experience, but it’s more than twice the price. (It’s £339 or £389 from Google, but the current version is overdue for replacement.)</p><p>You could also consider a Windows 8.1 tablet or hybrid, now there are models that are competitive with the higher-end Android and Apple tablets. For example, the 8in <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/uk/p/dell-venue-8-pro/pd?~srd=true&amp;sk=dell%20venue%208%20pro&amp;scat=prod&amp;ref=ac\">Dell Venue 8 Pro</a> tablet costs £249, and you can now get a 10.1in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Asus-VivoTab-ME400c-10-1-inch-Tablet/dp/B00D8VB5F2/\">Asus VivoTab ME400c</a> for £249.99 at Amazon.co.uk – the same price as a discounted <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Google-Nexus-10-BLACK/dp/B00AXDU5Y0/\">Google Nexus 10</a>. You’d have to pay extra for a keyboard for any of these tablets, so the Asus Transformer Book T100 Convertible looks good value at £349.95. Like Asus’s earlier Android-based Transformers, this looks and works like a lightweight laptop, but you can detach the screen and use it as a tablet. That means you can do PC-style photo processing in Adobe Elements or Lightroom, run Windows Live Movie Maker etc, use it as a touch-screen tablet for showing photos, and plug it into an HDTV via a micro HDMI cable, all from a single device.</p><p><b><br></b></p>","headline":"How can I show off my digital photos at a dinner party?","trailText":"Christine has been asked to take some of her photos of Australia to a dinner party, but how can she show them without using a computer?

The Microsoft site has a tutorial, but is still somewhat baffling, and it seems fairly time-consuming. Would I be wasting my time pressing on? I am not keen on replacing an otherwise satisfactory netbook with a tablet.</i></p><p><b>Dave Horne</b></p><p>Microsoft will soon stop releasing security patches for Windows XP, though it will continue to provide updates for its anti-virus program, Microsoft Security Essentials. XP will keep on working, but it will be more dangerous to use it, because malware writers will be able to find security holes in XP by examining the patches for later versions of Windows. Someone with safe surfing habits and good backups could keep using XP, though I wouldn’t recommend it. Less knowledgeable and less vigilant users should change.</p><p>Some netbooks and laptops already include a solution in the form of a separate Linux-based operating system called Splashtop. This is installed under a variety of names: Asus ExpressGate, HP QuickWeb, and so on. It’s not very nice, but you could use Splashtop online and Windows XP offline.</p><h2>Picking Windows</h2><p>The first step with a Windows upgrade is always the same: download and run the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor\">Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</a>, or the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=261871\">Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant</a>. These will check your current system for compatibility. Most PCs that run XP should run Windows 7 or 8, but if you only have 1GB of memory, it would be worth expanding this to 2GB, if you can.</p><p>I’d consider Windows 8 because it is a better operating system than Windows 7. It’s more economical in its use of resources, smoother in operation, has improved security features, and will be upgradeable to the next version of Windows. Yes, the Start screen works better with touch, but you can set 8.1 to boot straight to the desktop, and/or install utilities that make it work more like Windows 7. Examples include <a href=\"http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/\">Start8</a> and <a href=\"http://classicshell.net/\">Classic Shell</a>.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about Windows Modern (aka Metro) apps because they will not run on a netbook’s limited 1024 x 600 pixel screen display. They need at least 1024 x 768 pixels, unless you use “downscaling” as explained at <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/134022/how-to-run-modern-windows-8-apps-on-a-netbook/\">howtogeek.com</a>.</p><p>However, you missed the launch upgrade offers, so Windows 8 could cost you more. Checking Amazon.co.uk, the best offers at the moment are <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/32-bit-English-software-intended-builders/dp/B004Q0UVKY/\">32-bit Windows 7 Ultimate on DVD (OEM edition)</a> for £49.99 and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Windows-Pro-Upgrade-Edition-Vista/dp/B008GRKGXK/\">Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Edition</a> -- which includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions -- for £99.99. OEM editions are provided for system builders or Original Equipment Manufacturers so the price does not include any support.</p><p>Note that you will need the 32-bit version if your netbook has the usual Intel Atom processor, though a 64-bit processor and operating system would obviously be better.</p><h2>Doing the upgrade</h2><p>There are two main problems with upgrading to Windows 7. First, Microsoft only supports one-step upgrades and (because of Vista) Windows 7 is two steps from XP. So, you can’t do an “in place” upgrade, only a “clean installation” that replaces XP completely. You will therefore need to back up all your data beforehand and re-install all your programs afterwards. Microsoft provides the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7349\">Windows Easy Transfer for Windows XP</a> program to help, but it will still take some time.</p><p>Second, your netbook does not have a built-in DVD drive, so you will have to find another way to install Windows 7. The simplest is to add an external DVD drive via a USB port, but if you don’t already own one, this would be another extra cost. The usual solution is to create a bootable 4GB or larger USB thumb drive, and use a second PC to copy all the files from the Windows DVD to that.</p><p>It’s a bit tricky to create a bootable USB thumb drive formatted with the Windows NTFS file system. The <a href=\"http://www.techspot.com/community/topics/how-to-install-windows-7-on-a-netbook-using-a-usb-flash-drive.183072/\">TechSpot</a> website has a comprehensive guide, but it’s probably simpler to use one of the utilities designed for the purpose. <a href=\"http://www.wintobootic.com/\">WiNToBootic</a> is fast and versatile because you can use a DVD, a hard drive folder, or an ISO disc image as the source. Alternatives include <a href=\"http://rufus.akeo.ie/\">Rufus</a>, <a href=\"http://wintoflash.com/home/en/\">WinToFlash</a>, and <a href=\"http://windows-bootable-image-creator.en.softonic.com/\">Windows Bootable Image (WBI) Creator</a>.</p><p>Microsoft also offers a free utility: the <a href=\"http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool\">Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool</a>. This assumes you only have one PC, and that you will download an ISO disc image of Windows 7. If you can access your Windows DVD on a second PC, you can create an ISO image with CD/DVD burning software, such as <a href=\"http://www.imgburn.com/\">ImgBurn</a>.</p><p>Once you have the Windows 7 files on your USB thumbdrive, change the boot order in your netbook’s BIOS chip to boot from USB, then install Windows in the normal way. Bear in mind that if it all goes wrong, you will need to restore a back-up image of XP from an external hard drive.</p><h2>Is it worth it? Not really…</h2><p>Is it worth all the time and effort on top of the financial outlay? It depends whether messing about with PCs is a hobby or, if not, how much you value your time. If you have to restore a lot of data, re-install software and re-download a dozen or more utilities (Firefox, SlimClean, FreeFileSync, Dropbox, Kindle etc) then it’s going to take at least a day.</p><p>Either way, the upgrade is not a good financial investment. Second hand netbooks usually fetch from £25 to £100 on eBay.co.uk, and even an immaculate, year-old <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/ASUS-EeePC-X101CH-BLK043S-10-1-320-GB-Intel-Atom-1-6-GHz-1-GB-Netbook-/321313686537\">Asus Eee PC X101CH</a> only fetched £102 this week. There are thousands of netbooks sloshing around, and many of them go by without attracting any bids.</p><p>If you want to continue using a netbook, I think you have two rational options: either run a free Linux such as Lubuntu -- which will still take time to install and learn, and won’t run your old software -- or sell it and buy a second hand netbook running Windows 7 or Windows 7 Starter. This is not the full version, but it does the job.</p><p>Unfortunately, netbooks provide a very limited computing experience compared to light Windows 7 laptops and Windows 8 hybrids. For example, you could get a brand new “netbook” such as the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/X102BA-10-1-inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-Black/dp/B00FC55SVO/\">Asus X102BA for £276.18</a>. Admittedly it has a very slow 1.0GHz AMD A4-1200 processor, but compared with your current machine, it has more memory (4GB), a bigger hard drive (500GB), faster comms (USB3), better graphics (Radeon HD8180), better screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a touch-screen, 64-bit Windows 8, and a free copy of Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student worth £115. It will also save you a lot of time by booting, hibernating, and shutting down faster, and it should load web pages noticeably faster. There are many similar machines around, including hybrids with detachable tablet screens.</p><p>It’s good to make things last, up to a point, but sometimes they become obsolete. A new mini-laptop like the Asus X102BA is cheaper than many tablets and smartphones, and should last much longer, so it will provide better value in the long run.</p>","headline":"How can I upgrade my netbook from XP to Windows 7?","trailText":"Windows XP is coming to the end of its life and Dave wants to know how to replace it with Windows 7… though there may be better options","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/13/1392307174001/bfe53a1e-c69e-4dde-bfb4-48b8a5129cfc-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1159","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/feb/13/how-can-i-upgrade-my-netbook-from-xp-to-windows-7","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2014/feb/13/how-can-i-upgrade-my-netbook-from-xp-to-windows-7","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/computing","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows","webTitle":"Windows","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jackschofield","webTitle":"Jack Schofield","rcsId":"GNL004401","r2ContributorId":"15761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jack_schofield_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jack Schofield is the Guardian's computer editor.

PC?","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-06T18:55:05Z","sectionName":"Technology","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/askjack/2014/feb/06/move-files-mac-windows-pc","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mgk5","standfirst":"<p>Two questions this week: Carla wants to share some files with her dad, who uses Windows, but she has run into problems, while Anon wants to play Apple Lossless files on his Windows machine</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><b>I have a Mac and an external hard drive that includes some important family files. I bought a 4TB hard drive for my dad, and thought it would be easy to copy the files over so he could use them on his PC. However, my Mac doesn’t recognise his hard drive, and his PC won’t recognise my hard drive. Any suggestions?</b></p><p><b>Carla</b><br></p><p>The hard drives should not be a problem, unless your computers are very old. Macs and Windows machines do have their own preferred file formats for internal hard drives, but external hard drives don’t always ship with these pre-installed. They tend to use a version of Microsoft’s FAT file format, which dates back to the MS DOS (or IBM PC DOS) operating system used by the IBM PC in 1981. Most operating systems can read files in these old formats.</p><p>When DOS was born, popular hard drives only had 5MB or 10MB of storage space, which you could fill today with a single animated GIF. In 1996, Microsoft introduced FAT32 to handle much larger hard drives, and FAT32 is still in common use. However, hard drives keep getting bigger -- now they are typically 500GB to 4TB -- and in 2006, Microsoft released a new extended version, exFAT. In theory, this can handle drives up to 64 zettabytes, though 512TB is the recommended maximum.</p><p>Hard drives will have to double in size another seven times to reach that.</p><p>If your dad’s new 4TB EHD (external hard drive) has been formatted in FAT32 or exFAT, then both his PC and your Mac should be able to read it. All updated versions of Windows XP and later versions of Windows support both FAT32 and exFAT. Apple already supported FAT32 and it added support for exFAT in Mac OS X 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard) and later versions of OS X.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQaFNgU2cBU\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQaFNgU2cBU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Mac to PC file transfer using an ethernet cable</figcaption> </figure> <p>Even if the 4TB drive has been formatted in Windows’ NTFS (New Technology File System) format, then your Mac should still be able to read it, though it won’t be able to write to it. Apple added read-only support for NTFS in 2003 with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and many Mac users need it for running Windows under Boot Camp.</p><p>Your dad can check the format of his 4TB EHD by running Windows Explorer and selecting Computer in the left-hand pane. All the PC’s drives will be shown in the right-hand pane. If he right-clicks on the 4TB drive and selects Properties from the drop-down menu, the Properties sheet will have an entry for “File System” that will usually be NTFS or FAT32. Either should be fine. However, if both of you want to read and write to this particular EHD, I suggest reformatting it in exFAT while it’s still empty. You should then be able to copy files to it with your Mac. If your Mac still refuses to recognise it, you can tell it to initialise the drive as an MS-DOS disk (ie FAT32).</p><p>Meanwhile, your external hard drive is probably formatted in a version of Apple’s Hierarchical File System (HFS). Windows PCs won’t normally read that without an additional software driver, such as Erik Larsson’s <a href=\"http://catacombae.org/hfsx.html\">HFSExplorer</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/\">DiskInternals</a> Linux Reader. (It’s a Windows program that reads Linux and Mac disks.) Both are free.</p><p>So, you could use your Mac to copy the files to your dad’s 4TB FAT32/exFAT drive, or your dad could install a free HFS+ driver and use his PC to read them from your Mac drive. I don’t know which would be simpler, but if the first one doesn’t work, you can try the second.</p><p>Finally, although an external hard drive is a good way to move files from a Mac to a PC, there are other ways to do it. The most obvious solution is to use a USB Flash drive. This can get tedious, depending on how much data you need to move. However, SanDisk sells thumb drives with capacities up to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Cruzer-Glide-Flash-SDCZ60-128G-B35/dp/B007YX9OGW\">128GB</a>, so it’s just a case of deciding how big a drive you need. Some of the Amazon reviews complain that the transfer speed of the 128GB version is very slow, but trying to do it via a cloud storage system would be even slower.</p><p>A less obvious solution is to use a standard ethernet cable to connect the two machines together, as shown in this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQaFNgU2cBU\">YouTube video</a>. This should also work quickly.</p><h2>Playing ALAC files in Windows</h2><p><b>I have some Apple Lossless files on my Mac and also want to play them on my Windows PC. Is there a simple way to do this?</b></p><p><b>Anon</b><br></p><p>The problem with ALAC is that it’s not widely supported outside the Apple world, where FLAC is the de facto lossless standard. The answer depends on whether you want to convert your &lt;A href=“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alac\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alac</a>“&gt;ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)&lt;/A&gt; music files to another format that’s more popular on Windows, and if so, which.</p><p>The options include FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) and compressed “lossy” formats such as MP3 or AAC. If you don’t need the full fidelity of lossless playback, then Lame MP3 or AAC will save a lot of space. Apple lossless files take up about 5MB per minute whereas MP3 might be 1MB per minute.</p><p>One lossless format can be converted into another lossless format without any loss of sound quality, so that’s not a problem. However, people often convert lossless files into a compressed format for use on a PC, phone or MP3 player. This does cause some loss in sound quality, though you may not be able to hear the difference.</p><p>You should be able to play your ALAC files in Windows by using either the <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\">VLC</a> media player or <a href=\"http://www.foobar2000.org/\">foobar2000</a>, but that may not fit well with whatever you use at the moment. However, if you have an iPhone and/or an iPad or iPod, then these support Apple Lossless. Also, you will already be using iTunes for Windows, QuickTime etc. In this scenario, converting your ALAC files to FLAC would be a bad idea, though you should still consider AAC.</p><p>However, if you use an Android phone or tablet, then it may be worth converting them, as FLAC is now supported as standard on Android. On your PC, you can download a set of open codecs from <a href=\"http://www.xiph.org/dshow/\">Xiph.org</a>. The package also includes support for Ogg Vorbis, Speex, Theora, and WebM. These are directshow filters and should work normally with Windows Media Player and hundreds of other standard Windows programs.</p><p>For people who do want to do file conversions, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/xld/\">XLD</a> (X Lossless Decoder) is a good option for Mac users. It’s also much better at ripping audio CDs than iTunes, more like <a href=\"http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/\">EAC</a> (Exact Audio Copy) for Windows. </p><p>Windows users who want to convert ALAC files to FLAC and other formats often like <a href=\"http://www.dbpoweramp.com/\">dbPowerAmp</a>, but it costs £24 to register after the free trial period. People who can’t or won’t pay can use <a href=\"http://xrecode.com/\">xrecode</a>, or the foobar2000 media player to do file conversions.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/04/how-to-delete-facebook-account\"><b>How to delete your Facebook account</b></a></p>","headline":"How can I move files from a Mac to a Windows PC?","trailText":"Two questions this week: Carla wants to share some files with her dad, who uses Windows, but she has run into problems, while Anon wants to play Apple Lossless files on his Windows machine.

What can he do?","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>I recently changed my internet service from BT to TalkTalk. I have lost Wi-Fi on my Fujitsu Esprimo V5535 and my Acer Revo, but my tablet and another laptop both connect.</em><br /><strong>Henry</strong><br /><br />Wireless networking is a huge can of worms, most of which have been hidden away. First, there was the Wi-Fi Alliance, which not only set interoperability requirements but made suppliers test them. Second, companies developed software to connect PCs, smartphones and tablets to these standardised Wi-Fi networks more or less automatically. One example was the Wireless Zero Configuration (WZC) utility added to Microsoft Windows XP. As a result, Wi-Fi usually works, except when it doesn't.</p><p>The first thing to try with both your machines is the built-in Windows troubleshooter, which usually fixes the problem, in my experience. The troubleshooter should pop up when Internet Explorer fails to make a connection, so you can just click the button that says \"Diagnose Connection Problems\". Otherwise, right-click the internet icon in the SysTray on the bottom right of the Task Bar (next to the clock) and select Troubleshoot Problems.</p><p>There are several other ways to run the Windows Network Diagnostics in Windows 7. For example, you can open the Control Panel's Network and Sharing Center, or go to the Start button in, type <em>network</em> in the search box, and select \"Identify and repair network problems\". For Windows XP users, Microsoft has an online guide: <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308007\">How to troubleshoot home networking in Windows XP</a>, but XP's Home and Small Office Networking Troubleshooter works in much the same way.</p><p>You can also try the networking equivalent of turning it off and on again. Go to the Network and Sharing Center and click \"Manage wireless networks\". Right-click on your wireless network and select \"Remove network\" from the drop-down list. Next, go back to the Network and Sharing Center, click \"Connect to a network\" and add your own Wi-Fi network.</p><p>If neither of those works, you can try the update and reboot route below. Ideally, keep a log of everything you try, in case you need to call in outside help.</p><h2>Update and reboot</h2><p>To begin, plug your Fujitsu laptop and Revo nettop into the mains and make sure the Power Options setting is on Maximum Performance. (To be specific, we don't want the Wireless Adapter Settings to be in Power Saving Mode where they might turn themselves off.) You should now be able to connect your Fujitsu laptop and Revo nettop to the internet via standard Ethernet cables.</p><p>When you get online, run Windows Update to get Windows up to date with essential (but not optional) updates. After that, check each manufacturer's website to see if they have any more recent drivers than the ones you have installed. If they do, use the Device Manager to update them. While you're at it, check to see if there are any firmware updates for whichever router TalkTalk has supplied, though generally I'd leave installing this until it's the next-to-last resort. (The last resort is re-installing Windows.)</p><p>As far as I know, TalkTalk is still using the IPv4 Internet Protocol not IPv6, so you may want to make sure all your devices either support both or only use IPv4. Microsoft has a support page, <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852\">How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows</a>, where you can disable or re-enable IPv6 simply by clicking a \"Fix it\" button. </p><p>With everything up-to-date, shut all your devices down, and turn off the power on your router for one minute. (If it is one of those rare models with a built-in battery, you will have to find and press the re-set button.) Once the router has come back up and reconnected, turn on your devices one at a time and see if they connect. The router acts as a NAT (Network Address Translation) router, which uses one internet (IP) address to talk to the public internet, but gives each of your devices its own private address, usually in the format 192.168.x.x. Obviously, each device must be assigned its own separate address, so as to avoid conflicts. If your Esprimo and Revo are both trying to use the same address, probably neither will work.</p><p>At this point, all your devices should connect correctly. If one doesn't, double-check that it is set to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol\">DHCP</a> (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) rather than a static IP address. With this approach, the device asks the router for an address and the router provides one. More accurately, it gives your PC a renewable lease on a specific address, which may last for a week or so.</p><h2>Using commands</h2><p>If you don't mind peeking inside the can of worms, you can check the IP configuration and force its renewal to one that, we hope, will work. To do this, open a command prompt (aka terminal window or \"DOS box\") by going to the Run box -- for example, press Windows Key+R -- typing <em>cmd</em> and clicking OK. This will run the cmd.exe program. At the command prompt, type <em>ipconfig /all</em> (there is one space after ipconfig) and check the result. It should say DHCP Enabled, Autoconfiguration Enabled, IPv4 Address Preferred, and give you the dates for Lease Obtained and Lease Expires.</p><p>Now you can force your Windows PC to refresh its IP configuration by going to the command prompt and typing <em>ipconfig /release</em> and pressing Enter, then <em>ipconfig /renew</em> and pressing Enter. If that doesn't work, you can re-set the whole TCP/IP stack back to its original state by using the NetShell utility, netsh, and try again. You don't need to learn NetShell commands because there's a \"Fix it\" button at <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357\">How to reset Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</a>.</p><p>There are a few other things that can mess up a Wi-Fi connection, but they're not usually problems for home users. Sometimes there are problems with network adaptors, but the Troubleshooter should catch them. If not, see <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-network-adapter-problems#1TC=windows-7\">How do I fix network adapter problems?</a> Sometimes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN\">Wake-on-LAN (WOL)</a> causes problems in PCs that are designed to be turned on remotely by a \"magic packet\" instead of responding to DHCP. This seems unlikely in your case.</p><p>You don't say if you have contacted TalkTalk for help, but if your Esprimo and Revo are still not connecting, then you can check the  <a href=\"http://www.talktalk-labs.com/support/\">Support FAQ</a> and post your problem in the <a href=\"http://www.talktalkmembers.com/\">TalkTalk Community forum</a>. I notice there's a long list of \"known issues\" with the <a href=\"http://www.talktalk-labs.com/support/faqs/huawei-hg533-known-issues/\">Huawei HG533</a> router, for example. This is the kind of thing that eventually drives people to install their own routers….</p>","headline":"How can I get my PCs to connect to my new Wi-Fi?","trailText":"<p>After Henry switched internet service providers, two of his PCs can no longer connect to Wi-Fi.

Surely there are other things that affect one's productivity much more than boot-up time. What do you think?<br />Chris</strong></p><p>People have been complaining about the boot-up time on Windows PCs because it used to take far too long. Happily, that has been fixed in Windows 8, which, if installed correctly, boots up very quickly. Indeed, when I hit the power button on a Microsoft Surface Pro 2 (I have one on loan), it starts up faster than my DAB radio. </p><p>There are four main reasons why the Surface Pro 2 boots in seconds and provides almost \"instant on\". First, it doesn't have to wait for the old and very slow BIOS chip: that's been replaced by a newer, more secure, industry standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\">UEFI</a> interface. Second, it isn't slowed by loading the \"crapware\" installed by most PC manufacturers, who make money by distributing (pre-loading) unwanted software. Third, it has a solid-state drive (SSD), so it's not waiting for a mechanical hard drive platter to spin up to speed. Fourth, in most cases, it's not actually booting: the power button is just waking it from hibernation. Nowadays, my Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs only ever get rebooted after Microsoft's monthly updates are downloaded on \"patch Tuesday\".</p><p>If you have an older Windows PC, the boot-up time should be around 50-90 seconds, and usually it's a case of \"the older, the longer\". You can spend some time optimising the boot sequence with <a href=\"http://slimcleaner.com/\">SlimCleaner</a> and/or <a href=\"http://www.anvir.com/freeware.htm\">AnVir Task Manager Free</a>. Removing programs and services you don't need should speed it up. Just saving 10-30 seconds pays off eventually, if you're sort of person who sits and waits for a PC instead of making a cup of tea, or whatever.</p><p>I agree that there are much better ways to increase your productivity, but these are harder to evaluate, and may cost money or involve work.</p><h2>Buy a fast PC</h2><p>In my experience, by far the biggest productivity boost comes from buying a fast PC, but it's not easy to measure. For example, a program may load in five seconds rather than 10, or a web page may load in three or four seconds rather than eight or nine. There are huge time savings -- and productivity gains -- if you do these things hundreds of times a week. However, most people aren't very sensitive to small time differences. The users who invest in fast chips and SSDs are typically gamers or people who have big jobs to run. If a program compilation, photo manipulation or spreadsheet calculation takes from 10 minutes to an hour to run, running it four or five times faster makes a very noticeable difference.</p><p>Given the salaries paid to programmers, graphic artists, video and photo editors, architects and similar workers, it would be insane not to give them fast PCs. (See: <a href=\"http://foldingair.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/how-much-does-your-slow-machine-cost.html\">How much does your slow machine cost your company?</a>.) But not everyone's time is so valuable.</p><h2>Automate things</h2><p>Another huge gain in productivity comes from automating processes. It drives me batty to see people manually changing two spaces to one space in a long piece of text, when they could use the Search/Replace command to do it in a couple of seconds. Better still, they could record a Microsoft Word macro to do this and several other tasks at the same time. The macro does the job almost instantly and can be re-used many times a day for many years.</p><p>In Microsoft Word and Excel, you now have to go to the Options menu and click \"Show Developer tab in the Ribbon\" to get to the Record Macro button. This is shocking. It implies that very few people are using macros to make productivity gains.</p><p>If you have a computer -- any computer -- you can use it to automate many other jobs instead of doing them manually. You can do it with macros, batch files, simple scripts, email filters, and free programs such as <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/\">Auto HotKey</a>. Some programs have batch processing facilities built in. For example, if I want to upload 20 photos to Facebook, I use BlueFive's <a href=\"http://bluefive.pair.com/downloads.htm\">PIXresizer</a> to reduce the whole batch to a reasonable size in one go. <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\">Adobe Lightroom</a>'s Sync Settings let you edit one picture and then apply the same changes to all the similar photos from the rest of the shoot. Doing each snap separately could take hours.</p><h2>Use keyboard shortcuts</h2><p>You can get massive gains in speed and productivity by using the keyboard instead of the mouse. For example, it takes a split second to hit Ctrl-S to save a file, whereas it takes several seconds to grab the mouse, go to the File menu and select Save. Yes, this does mean learning the shortcuts, which you can find by observing the underlined characters in the various menus. The ones everyone should know include Ctrl-A (select All), Ctrl-C (Copy), Ctrl-V (insert), Ctrl-X (cut) and, most importantly, Ctrl-Z (undo). Whenever you do something wrong, Ctrl-Z is your first option to undo it, though it doesn't work everywhere. Ctrl-Y is \"redo\".</p><p>For Microsoft Word users, Ctrl-Alt-V (Paste Special) is incredibly useful.</p><p>Not everyone needs to know that Alt-Spacebar-N will minimize a window or that Shift-F10 will pop up the equivalent of a right mouse-click, but shortcuts like these are hugely useful to people with limited vision or other disabilities.</p><p>There are a few useful Function key shortcuts, such as F2 to rename a file, F3 to search for a file or folder, and F5 to refresh a window. Alt-F4 closes the current window or application or, if there isn't one running, Windows. The useless one you always hit by mistake is F1 for Help.</p><p>Microsoft introduced a further selection of shortcuts with the Windows Key, which is the one with a Windows logo. Most of these aren't particularly useful unless you have Windows 8. If you do, then you should definitely know that hitting WinKey toggles between the desktop and Start screen, WinKey+X pops up the Power User menu, WinKey+E runs Explorer on the desktop, and WinKey+L locks the computer. The Power User menu provides instant access to the Control Panel, Command Prompt and other features, including shut-down options.</p><p>Some web-based applications also have keyboard shortcuts, including Gmail. Of course, it's quicker to use a desktop mail client, but if you have to use web-based email, learning the keyboard shortcuts can save a lot of time.</p><h2>Learn to touch-type</h2><p>Finally, one of the biggest productivity gains you can make is to learn to touch-type. If you are an experienced hunt-and-peck typist then you will lose some productivity to begin with. However, once the keystrokes have been committed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory\">\"muscle memory\"</a>, you'll be able to type without even thinking about it.</p><p>I'd expect every touch-typist to manage 30-40 words a minute, and a lot of PC users can do 60-80wpm, which is about as good as a good secretary. Really fast typists can do 80-100wpm. </p><p>There are plenty of <a href=\"http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php\">online</a> <a href=\"http://www.typingtest.com/\">typing</a> <a href=\"http://play.typeracer.com/\">tests</a> and touch-typing courses. I've previously recommended <a href=\"http://www.kaz-type.com/\">KAZ</a> (Keyboard A-Z), which aims to get you touch-typing in 90 minutes, but that was in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/nov/09/onlinesupplement\">2000</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/jun/24/onlinesupplement.shopping\">2004</a>.

Which file formats should he use?","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>Having a bit of a clear out, I thought I would rip some old DVDs to free up some space, as I did with my music collection some years ago. I planned to store the content on my NAS to stream/sync to a range of devices, including a couple of DLNA-compliant Smart TVs, iPad, iPhone, Xbox 360 and obviously PCs. I'm not overly concerned about file size, and would prefer the best-quality video and audio possible. I would also like to preserve any multichannel audio (ie 5.1 surround sound). What file formats would you recommend to enable me to remain flexible and future-proof myself as much as possible? I have already tried a couple of DVDs saved as .mpg, which work well with my smart TVs. I've tried importing these into iTunes for syncing with my iPad, but iTunes does not seem to like them.</em></p><p><strong>Scott Martin</strong></p><p></p><p>Most DVDs store movies in the standard MPEG-2 format (aka H.262) defined by the Motion Pictures Expert Group, though MPEG-1 is also supported. The video is held in VOB (Video Object) files. The video is interlaced for display on ordinary TV sets. The result is a resolution of 720 x 576 pixels at 25 frames per second, for 50Hz TV sets, or a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels at 29.97 frames per second, for 60Hz TV sets.</p><p>MPEG-2 was the obvious choice for DVDs as it was already being used for broadcast and cable television. The 720 x 480 format came from America's NTSC television system and 720 x 576 from Europe's PAL.</p><h2>ISO or MPEG?</h2><p>If you want to preserve everything on a DVD, then the simplest option is to copy the whole disc as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_disk_image\">ISO disc image</a>. You could burn this copy to another DVD for backup purposes. You could also play the ISO disc image using a software DVD player, including VideoLan's VLC, or rip it using your choice of DVD ripping software.</p><p>What you have done so far is to rip a couple of DVDs to MPEG-2 (.mpg), so you may have the full original video, but de-interlaced so it is now in the progressive display format used by computer monitors and HD TVs. However, you will probably have lost any extras, including VMG (video manager) files, subtitles, hidden files, adverts and alternative audio formats. DVDs can have audio tracks in PCM, DTS, MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2), or Dolby Digital (AC-3) format. MP2 and AC-3 are the most common, and if you have to pick one of those, choose AC-3. It is much more efficient (smaller files) and sounds better than MP2, which is antique – though, sadly, it's still used in Britain's antique DAB radios.</p><p>For future-proofing, MPEG-2 files are the next best thing to ISO images, and I don't foresee a time when PCs will be unable to play them. As with MP3 audio files, there are just too many around.</p><h2>The next generation</h2><p>Computers and processors have become cheaper and much more powerful since MPEG-2 was specified in the 1990s. This means we can now use much greater levels of compression to make files smaller, and yet still decode them fast enough to keep up the frame rate. This led to the Blu-ray optical disc format, which mandates support for two new video standards: MPEG-4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding) and VC-1, the latter being based on Microsoft's WMV-9. Some early Blu-ray discs actually used MPEG-2, as that was the basis for digital production at the time. However, H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 AVC – commonly known as H.264 – is the most widely used format.</p><p>Blu-ray movies usually come in 16:9 widescreen resolutions of 1280 x 720 pixels, which is known as HD (High Definition) or 720p, or 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is Full HD or 1080p, where p stands for \"progressive\". Blu-ray also allows for the use of interlaced video and the 4:3 DVD formats for backwards compatibility. HD TV sets will de-interlace videos automatically.</p><p>Now, video consumes a huge amount of space, so both DVDs and BDs use lossy compression to make the files smaller. MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 files are the equivalent of MP3 audio files in that respect. And, as you know, \"transcoding\" from one lossy format to another involves a loss in quality. It's something to avoid if possible, and if not, to do only once. </p><p>Fortunately, this usually isn't a problem if you're reducing the movie's resolution – for example, converting a 1080p video to 720p to get a much smaller file size – or viewing it on a smaller screen. It can be a problem if you are \"upscaling\" a DVD movie to 720p or 1080p.</p><h2>Movies for iPads and iPhones</h2><p>You don't have much choice if you want to use Apple iTunes and watch movies natively on an iPad or iPhone. Apple makes things simpler by eliminating dozens of popular alternatives (AVI, WMV, DivX, Xvid, FLV, MKV etc) and only allowing two real digital video options: MPEG-4 at 640 x 480 pixels and H.264 at up to 720p on most iPads, and up to 1080p on the iPad mini and iPad Air. Both formats are MPEG-4, so what's the difference? MPEG-4 comes in lots of varieties and H.264 is actually MPEG-4 AVC Part 10.</p><p>The alternative is to use a third-party video player, such as VideoLan's open source <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-ios/id650377962\">VLC for iOS</a>. The website says it \"can play all your movies and shows in most formats directly without conversion\" and it works with iTunes.</p><p>If you decide to convert files, it depends on your DVDs and your iPhone and iPad. Download one of the free video converters and transcode your 720 x 576 MPEG-2 movies into 640 x 480 MPEG-4 movies, which iTunes should be happy to accept. If you have any widescreen movies, then I'd convert them to H.264/AVC in the 720p format. You might get a little extra quality if your iPad supports 1080p, but on such a small screen, there won't be enough of a difference to justify the much bigger file sizes and longer transcoding times. (I don't own an iPad so I'm basing this opinion on using PCs with much bigger screens.)</p><h2>Transcoding software</h2><p>I've no idea which programs do the best job of transcoding movies for iOS, but there are so few options, it should be a fully automated process. Perhaps readers can recommend something. Otherwise you can always use one of the free video transcoders that handle the whole array of different file formats, codecs, resolutions, frame rates, bit-rates and so on. Examples include <a href=\"http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html\">Super ©</a>, which is slow and ugly, and <a href=\"http://handbrake.fr/\">Handbrake</a>, which is pretty clunky, as well as more stylish programs such as <a href=\"http://www.xmedia-recode.de/download.html\">Xmedia Recode</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mediacoderhq.com/\">Media Coder</a>. You may also find <a href=\"http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/\">Avidemux</a> useful for editing. Try downloading a few programs and see what works for you.</p><p>In defence of Super and Handbrake, I've used them for years and somehow got decent results out of them. I couldn't manage that in my brief trial of Media Coder, though I did get a good conversion in my one go with Xmedia Recode. Also, it may better to use <a href=\"http://vidcoder.codeplex.com/\">VidCoder</a> rather than Handbrake: it's easier to use and it uses Handbrake to do the transcoding.</p><p>With audio CDs, you can use Exact Audio Copy and FLAC, the Free Lossless Audio Codec, to make perfect digital copies that you can leave to your grandchildren, who will be able to convert them to whatever format is popular at the time. With DVDs, you don't get a perfect copy, just a lossy video file, so an ISO is the most future-proof option. However, an MPEG-2 file that matches the original (just in a different wrapper, as it were) is almost as good. If you're going to transcode MPEG-2 into something more modern, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is probably the best bet, and the files should be about half the size. Whether they'll be good enough for the 4K (3840 x 2160 pixel) screens we'll all be using in a few years is another matter.</p><h2>The UltraViolet solution</h2><p>If you're ripping commercial CDs or Blu-rays, you should store the original discs somewhere safe. These discs show that you own the originals and have re-purposed them for convenience, not pirated or downloaded them. Ideally, movie studios would make digital copies available online either free or for a reasonable fee. The industry now does this with its <a href=\"http://www.uvvu.com/index.php?lang=en-gb\">UltraViolet</a> system. If you buy DVDs or Blu-ray discs with UV stickers, you also get access to a cloud version that you can stream to different devices or download.</p><p>In the US, Walmart and some other stores are offering <a href=\"http://www.vudu.com/disc_to_digital.html\">Disc to Digital</a> upgrades for some movies. You take your DVDs and BDs to the store and pay $2 for a digital copy, which is actually stored by Vudu. You get to keep the DVDs. It's quicker and a lot more convenient than ripping them yourself, and of course, the quality is excellent. I haven't seen this promoted in the UK, though <a href=\"http://www.findanyfilm.com/new-releases/ultraviolet\">FindAnyFilm.com</a> supports UV, and Tesco has offered buyers free digital copies via its <a href=\"http://www.blinkbox.com/\">Blinkbox</a> service.</p>","headline":"What's the best format for storing digital movies?","trailText":"<p>Scott wants to convert his DVDs so he can save space and watch them on different devices, including his iPhone and iPad.

Andy Roberts' family is still using two decade-old Windows XP machines and he wants to know what to do with them","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>I've just found out about, and am incensed at, Microsoft's decision to <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/end-support-help\">stop supporting Windows XP</a> with security updates from April 8, 2014. What about the thousands of people who still happily use XP? I have two PCs that my family uses on a daily basis. </p><p>These are: <br />(1) Dell Dimension 4800 (circa 2002) with a 2.66GHz Pentium 4, 2.5GB of memory, 70GB hard disk. Had this since new. The original screen and video driver failed. I added RAM and an external 500GB hard drive.<br />(2) HP Compaq Presario SR1000 (circa 2004) with a 3.4GHz Pentium 4, 2GB of memory and 250GB hard disk. I just inherited this family hand-me-down and added RAM. It refused to work with two new 1GB DIMMs alongside the two existing 512MB DIMMs so had to take them out, but I could add two more 1GB RAMs.</p><p>It appears that I may be able to upgrade both PCs from Windows XP, but to what? Windows 7 or 8? Will this completely kill performance, as I assume Windows 7 and 8 are more resource hungry than XP!</em><br /><strong>Andy Roberts</strong><br /><br />Windows XP support is ending as part of Microsoft's standard <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle\">software lifecycle</a>, and Microsoft has stepped up its warnings <a href=\"https://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2013/04/09/the-countdown-begins-support-for-windows-xp-ends-on-april-8-2014.aspx\">over the past year</a>. But I don't think you should be incensed, because you've had a very good deal. Dell and HP probably paid Microsoft about $45 each for these copies of XP, and if they bundled crapware with the operating system, you paid somewhat less. In return, you have had 10 or 12 years' use, three major updates -- Service Pack 1 (in 2002), SP2 (2004) and SP3 (2008) -- plus new browsers and other free programs such as the Windows Live Suite. However, in the 12 years since you bought your Dell, you haven't paid Microsoft a penny, so threatening to withdraw your custom isn't going to cut much ice.</p><p>I'll be amazed if any other operating system that came out around the same time as XP -- Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma), IBM OS/2 4.52, Novell NetWare 6.0 etc -- still gets free support. Apple has not only shipped eight versions of Mac OS X since then, it has dumped PowerPC for Intel chips. The Ubuntu version of Linux hadn't even been launched: it first appeared three years after XP.</p><p>Of course, Microsoft has also released new operating systems since 2001, with cut-price deals to tempt people to upgrade to Windows Vista in 2006 and Windows 7 in 2009. The best deal came when Windows 8 was launched in 2012: Microsoft offered an upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 8 Pro for <a href=\"http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/07/02/upgrade-to-windows-8-pro-for-39-99.aspx\">$39.99</a> or £25, discounted from $199.99 or £189.99. Indeed, you can still get the Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Edition from Amazon.co.uk for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Windows-Pro-Upgrade-XP-Vista/dp/B008GRKGXK/\">£66.99</a>, which isn't a bad deal if you can run it. The upgrade from 8.0 to 8.1 is free.</p><h2>Upgrades bring benefits</h2><p>The rational way to approach computer hardware purchases is to amortize the cost over its expected lifespan, which is typically from three to five years. After five years, components become outdated and increasingly prone to failure, starting with the battery on the motherboard and then the hard drive. For companies, the increased cost of maintenance is generally much higher than the cost of buying new PCs. Deferring inevitable upgrades makes even less sense if you benefit financially from using a newer operating system. When upgrading from XP, this includes much greater stability and reliability, faster and smoother operation, boot time savings and greatly increased security.</p><p>Some of these benefits come from switching from 32-bit XP to 64-bit Windows 7 or Windows 8 with access to more memory. However, although it's not optimal, Windows 8 will run on 1GHz processors with only 2GB. I haven't upgraded a PC from XP to Windows 8 myself, but a PC that runs XP reasonably well should run Windows 8.1 at least as well, and possibly better. </p><p>A quick search finds a <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/02/operating-system-smackdown-windows-8.html\">blog post</a> by Troy Hunt. He installed Windows 8 on a 7-year-old Lenovo ThinkPad T60 laptop with a 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo processor and 1GB of RAM, and as you can see from side-by-side comparisons in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6192ie9MbU\">YouTube video</a>, Windows 8 outperforms XP. The main problem is that he couldn't install 64-bit Windows 8, and had to install the 32-bit version instead.</p><h2>Upgrading Windows</h2><p>Unfortunately, Windows 7 and Windows 8 are not guaranteed to run on old PCs, because of their hardware limitations. In particular, <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh975398.aspx\">Windows 8 needs support for Intel's PAE/NX/SSE2 features</a> -- Physical Address Extension (PAE) mode, No-eXecute (NX), and Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2) -- plus Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in the BIOS, plus WDDM graphics drivers. <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=321548\">Download the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant</a>, which will check both hardware and software for compatibility. For further advice, see the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8\">Update to Windows 8.1: FAQ</a>.</p><p>People have run Windows 8 on even slower processors, such as the 733MHz Intel Pentium III (Coppermine), which supports PAE. Sadly, I reckon Windows 8 not run on your Dell Dimension, because PAE support wasn't added to the Pentium 4 line until the start of 2004. I am almost certain it will not run on your Compaq Presario SR1000, because <a href=\"http://ark.intel.com/products/27469/Intel-Pentium-4-Processor-550-supporting-HT-Technology-%281M-Cache-3_40-GHz-800-MHz-FSB%29\">Intel's Ark</a> says its Pentium 4-550 doesn't have \"Trusted Execution Technology\". </p><p>To get Windows 8 running, you would need to change the motherboard and perhaps install a new graphics card. You should also change the hard drives, which are beyond the age at which I'd expect them to fail. In other words, it would be much better to get one or two new or second hand PCs either from eBay.co.uk or one of the recycling groups, or even a skip. (Sorry!) Almost any desktop from 2007/8 or later would do. As long as it runs Vista SP1 or better, it will be a big improvement on XP. (I still run a Vista SP1 machine and it's rock solid. It's far a better operating system than the ignoranti claim.)</p><h2>Three alternatives</h2><p>That leaves you with three alternatives for your current PCs: keep using XP, install Linux, or recycle them.</p><p>Windows XP won't suddenly stop working in April, but many people think it will come under attack. Malware writers will look at the security holes that get patched in supported versions of Windows and know that they are not patched in unsupported XP. That will make XP systems easy targets, but if you run Google Chrome (not IE8) and do plenty of anti-virus checking, you might survive. Whether the rest of your family will be able to maintain the requisite level of alertness is another matter. You could try making them use restricted or guest accounts.</p><p>Installing Linux is an obvious solution, as long as you don't have any vital Windows programs (which you may need to read your data) or games. However, you and your family will have to do some relearning, which takes time, and you will have to cope when Linux goes wrong, which it does. Since recent versions of Linux require recent PCs, and the latest KDE and Gnome desktops consume lots of memory. I suggest installing <a href=\"http://lubuntu.net/\">Lubuntu</a>, the lightweight version of Ubuntu, which has a lightweight <a href=\"http://lxde.org/\">LXDE</a> desktop that more-or-less copies pre-XP versions Windows.</p><p>New versions of Ubuntu come out every six months and rapidly become unsupported, so go for Lubuntu 14.04 LTS: the first Lubuntu with Long Term Support. This doesn't mean 10 years, but at least LTS has now been extended to five years. It should be out in April. An alternative is <a href=\"http://xubuntu.org/\">Xubutnu</a> 14.04 LTS with the Xfce desktop.</p><p>But really, you should recycle at least one of your XP machines and buy something newer. When the Pentium 4 came out, it was all about raw speed, but times have changed. Intel junked the Pentium 4 architecture and started on a new course where cool running and \"performance per Watt\" are more important. A modern 1.5GHz Intel processor will not only run a lot faster, it will do it without consuming so much expensive electricity.</p><p>Although Lubuntu will keep your old PCs in service, they won't last forever. Perhaps you should start putting £2 a week in a jar. After four years, you'll have enough to buy a decent PC.

The Vostro that I have my eye on has Windows 7 whereas my current desktop has Vista. My concern, as an elderly duffer, is the potential cost of renewing expensive programs. Will my Microsoft Office 2007 and Adobe Elements 6 discs still be compatible with the new machine?</p><p>Will I also be able to transfer my documents and my email addresses and emails, and tools such as Adobe Reader and Flash? What are the possible expenses/pitfalls in upgrading to a new computer from an old one?</em><br /><strong>Richard Lynas</strong><br /></p><p>Microsoft Office 2007 will work well on your new Windows 7 PC. Adobe Elements 6 came out before Windows 7, so it may not be fully compatible. The Windows compatibility centre allows users to vote on whether a program is compatible or not, and the current score for <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Adobe%20Photoshop%20Elements&amp;vendor=Adobe&amp;ModelOrVersion=6&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows+7\">Elements 6</a> is 3-3.</p><p>Microsoft recommends a paid upgrade, but buying the current <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-elements.html\">Adobe Elements 12</a> will cost you £54.71 from Adobe (until January 9) or about £60 from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-12-Mac/dp/B00EWH8ATA/\">Amazon.co.uk</a> (and personally, I'd go for the boxed DVD). There have been lots of improvements since Photoshop Elements 6 came out in 2007, so it may well be worth upgrading.</p><p>Commercial programs sometimes have problems because software companies now track licences online. A second installation may be seen as a pirate copy. For this reason, it's a good idea to uninstall programs from your old PC before you install them on the new one. If Photoshop Elements 6 doesn't load in Windows 7, or says \"Licensing for this product has stopped working,\" then you will need to <a href=\"http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/error-licensing-stopped-windows.html#main_Solution_1__Apply_the_Licensing_Service_Update_\">Apply the Licensing Service Update</a>.</p><p>To move your emails and data -- but not your installed programs -- download the free Microsoft program Windows Easy Transfer. You'll probably need the version from here: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14179\">Windows Easy Transfer for transferring from Windows Vista (32 bit) to Windows 7</a>. Download it to your Vista PC and run it there. Windows 7 already has a copy built in.</p><h2>Make a fresh start</h2><p>When you get your new Vostro, you will need to go through an automated setup process that sets the time, date and location, and creates user accounts with names and passwords. After that, go to Windows Update and install the latest patches. To do this, click the Orb in the bottom left, type <em>up</em> into the search box, and select Windows Update. With luck there will not be many. However, Windows Update installs files in batches, so it's important to go back several times. If Windows 7 installs 12 updates, that doesn't mean there are only 12 updates to install. There could well be hundreds. </p><p>Once Windows 7 is up to date, you can think about removing any potentially unwanted programs or PUPs, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/oct/31/windows-pups-potentially-unwanted-programs-pc-uninstall\">I wrote about recently</a>. The only ones you are likely to get with a Dell Vostro are Dell's backup software, which you should keep, and a free trial anti-virus program, which you can remove if you want. This may involve going to the AV supplier's website and downloading a \"removal tool\". I'd certainly look for one as modern anti-virus programs are plumbed in very deeply, to try to prevent malware from disabling them.</p><p>If you want a free anti-virus program, <a href=\"http://www.avast.com/en-au/free-antivirus-download\">Avast!</a> and <a href=\"http://free.avg.com/gb-en/free-antivirus-download\">AVG Anti-Virus Free 2014</a> are good options. Many people use the lightweight but less thorough Microsoft Security Essentials, in which case it's a good idea to run periodic scans with <a href=\"http://www.malwarebytes.org/\">Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a>. In fact, that's never a bad idea.</p><h2>Install free utilities</h2><p>Most of us use some of the thousands of free Windows utilities such as, in your case, Adobe Reader and Flash. In general, you should not transfer these from one PC to another: download the latest versions instead. You can do this by visiting a lot of different websites, or you can get them all from an app store, <a href=\"http://allmyapps.com/\">All My Apps</a>. It can also remind you of upgrades, but if you find that annoying, you can uninstall the All My Apps program or turn it off. <a href=\"http://www.tucows.com/windows\">Tucows</a> and <a href=\"http://www.majorgeeks.com/\">MajorGeeks</a> are also good sources.</p><p>For Windows 7, I use and recommend the Firefox browser, Secunia's Personal Software Inspector, Slimware's SlimCleaner, Piriform's CCleaner, Paint.net, FreeFileSync, DoubleKiller, Dropbox, the Windows Live suite (if not already installed) and the <a href=\"http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm\">K-Lite Codec Mega Pack</a>. I also use Media Player Classic instead of Windows Media Player, and Cubic Reality's <a href=\"http://www.cubicreality.com/ce/download/\">CubicExplorer</a> instead of Windows File Explorer, though these may not be to everyone's taste.</p><p>Don't install Oracle's Java at this stage, as it's a security risk. You can install it later if you find you can't do without it.</p><p>Other useful free programs include Auto Hotkey, Ditto (a clipboard manager), Evernote, Process Explorer and Skype.</p><p>When downloading utilities, either use All My Apps (or a similar trustworthy site) or links from the supplier's website. Avoid using links from Google adverts. Also, be extra careful when installing free programs, because some software suppliers earn money by foisting unwanted programs on you. These PUPs include toolbars from Ask or Google, or Google's Chrome browser. Be extra extra careful when installing things from Adobe and Apple.</p><p>In a few cases, you may want to copy a utility from your old PC because you don't like the latest version. I have a couple of these, such as Wisdomsoft's ScreenHunter Free version 4 (a screen capture program) and Microsoft's FreeCell and Cards.dll from 2004. There are several websites that stock old versions of programs including <a href=\"http://www.oldversion.com/\">oldversion.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oldapps.com/\">Old Apps</a>.</p><h2>Backing things up</h2><p>Setting up a Windows PC just the way you want it takes time, and you don't want to do it more than once. To avoid this, I use Windows 7's Backup and Restore program to take a snapshot of the hard drive and store it somewhere safe. The Vostro hard drive includes a hidden Recovery Partition, but this may take you back to the beginning, with no updates etc. When fully set up with programs and data, run Windows 7's Backup and Restore or Dell's DataSafe Local Backup program to back up your PC to an external hard drive, and keep it backed up on your chosen schedule.</p><p>I also keep separate backups of important folders such as My Photographs and My Work. I use FreeFileSync to copy these to another external hard drive. The routines are saved so I just have to click the BatchRun.ffs_batch file and then hit the Synchronise button. Current work files, created in Microsoft Office, are backed up to my 25GB Microsoft SkyDrive so I can get at them from anywhere. Everybody has different requirements: just figure out what works for you.</p><p>Finally, a small confession. I think I have given you appropriate advice, but there are lots of ways to do things. When I switched from a Dell Dimension running Windows XP to a Vostro running Windows 7, I did it slightly differently. I took the hard drive out of the old PC, slotted it into an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Allcam-IT-735-Enclosure-Drives-Black/dp/B000V8KQE6\">IT-735 USB2 / e-SATA combo 3.5\" SATA Hard Drive Enclosure</a> bought from Amazon, and plugged it into a USB port on the new PC. This made copying files much easier. I've forgotten which registry hack I used to take ownership of the old drive, but <a href=\"http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/easily-take-ownership-of-files-and-folders-in-windows-7/\">Ownership Changer</a> should do the job.</p><p>Either way, a good new PC should be dramatically faster and much smoother running than your seven-year-old Dell Dimension. I reckon you'll be sorry you didn't upgrade earlier.</p>","headline":"How can I move my files and programs to a new PC?","trailText":"<p><strong>Ask Jack:</strong> Richard plans to replace his 2006-vintage desktop, and wants to know how to move his software and data</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/3/1388764870967/AllMyApps-screen-grab-003.jpg","wordcount":"1238","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T17:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/jan/03/ask-jack-move-files-programs-pc","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2014/jan/03/ask-jack-move-files-programs-pc","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/computing","references":[]},{"id":"technology/microsoft","webTitle":"Microsoft","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/microsoft","references":[]},{"id":"technology/adobe","webTitle":"Adobe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/adobe","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/adobe","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows","webTitle":"Windows","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows-7","webTitle":"Windows 7","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows-7","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows-7","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jackschofield","webTitle":"Jack Schofield","rcsId":"GNL004401","r2ContributorId":"15761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jack_schofield_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jack Schofield is the Guardian's computer editor.

Reading an article by the organisation that sets and regulates SD card performance standards (<a href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/\">Greater Performance Choice</a>) made me even more confused.<br />We use microSD cards in compact cameras, Samsung and Nokia Lumia smartphones, and for storing and saving games in our original Wii. Does it matter which class of card is used?</em><br /><strong>Mark Campbell</strong><br /><br />Secure digital (SD) cards started out as a wonderfully simple Flash storage format, and quickly replaced CompactFlash, MMC and other types of card. But as usage grew, people began to need different speeds and sizes. The result is the chaos we enjoy today.</p><p>For standard applications like single-shot compact cameras, it doesn't matter which class of SD card you buy, as long as it's compatible. Storing a 500K to 2MB file is not hard. However, if you want to shoot a rapid sequence of photos, the card has to be fast enough to keep up. If you want to shoot high-definition videos, keeping up can be a challenge. For this sort of application, you'll probably need a fast card.</p><p>When buying an SD card, you have to consider three things: the physical size, the storage capacity, and the speed at which it can write data.</p><h2>Physical size</h2><p>There are now three sizes of SD card. The original format started with cards measuring 32 x 24mm, which was very small for the time. These are still common in digital cameras, audio recorders and similar products. Smartphone makers wanted smaller cards. This resulted in the miniSD format, measuring 21.5 x 20mm, and then microSD cards, measuring 11 x 15mm. </p><p>You can use a miniSD or microSD card in an SD card slot by plugging it into an SD-sized adapter, and some mini/micro cards are sold with them. Obviously, you can't fit an SD card into a miniSD or microSD slot.</p><p>I assumed most of us needed different sizes, so it's handy if all your devices use the microSD format. However, other things being equal, full-size SD cards are generally faster than small ones.</p><h2>Data storage</h2><p>When it comes to storage, there are three different types of card: SD, SDHC (High Capacity) and SDXC (eXtended Capacity).</p><p>Originally, an SD card could hold up to 2GB of data using Microsoft's FAT-12 or FAT-16 file format. This was a huge amount in 1999, and most cards stored a lot less. In 2006, when the 2GB limit was becoming a problem, the industry introduced high capacity SDHC cards that could store up to 32GB using FAT-32. After that, in 2009, came SDXC cards able to store up to 2TB using Microsoft's proprietary exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) format.</p><p><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3553\">Apple</a> started supporting exFAT with Mac OS X 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard), which makes exFAT the best choice for shared hard drives or transferring very large data files. It also means that future SD cards will be able to use exFAT up to 512TB and, in theory, beyond. Either way, the SD Card Association provides a free <a href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/\">SD Formatter 4.0 for SD/SDHC/SDXC</a> program for Windows and Mac OS X for people who want to check or reformat cards. This optimises performance and protects the Secure Digital card's secure \"Protected Area\".</p><p>Today, 8GB and 16GB cards are big enough for most purposes, though people may well choose a 32GB or 64GB card to expand the storage in an MP3 player or mobile phone. If buying a 64GB or 128GB card, it's very important to check that your device can support it. The Samsung Galaxy S4 can handle 64GB cards, but most phones can't, and I don't know of a European or American phone that supports 128GB cards. If you need 1TB or 2TB of storage, you'll have to buy an external hard drive.</p><h2>Card speeds</h2><p>Things get confusing when it comes to speed ratings. The SD Card Association has different classes of cards, and produced a bunch of mandatory logos with the class number inside a big C. However, Class 2 is 2MBps, Class 4 is 4MBps, Class 6 is 6MBps, and Class 10 is 10MBps or faster -- sometimes much faster. For this reason, faster cards are often marked with the speed in large letters, such as 45MB/s or 90MB/s. </p><p>If you check the specifications of your devices, you should be able to find out how fast it can write data to an SD card. As long as your cards can handle that data rate, you should be OK.</p><p>Note that the class rating shows a minimum speed, not the actual speed. A good Class 2 card may work faster than a Class 6 or even a Class 10 card. The only way to find the real performance of a card is to <a href=\"http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1582172\">run a benchmark test</a>.</p><p>Also bear in mind that megabytes per second -- MBps, usually written as MB/s on cards --  are eight times faster than megabits per second (Mbps), because there are 8 bits in a byte. A 2MBps card is a 16Mbps card.</p><p>Finally, SD card speeds are sometimes cited as \"100x Speed\" or whatever. This is somewhat akin to measuring things in football fields or areas the size of Wales. It's based on the speed of an original CD-Rom drive: 150 KBps. You will recall that you ended up with a 16x or 48x CD-Rom drive, and you can extend the idea to 48x or 400x SD cards. I don't find this a particularly useful way of rating SD cards, unless your camera manufacturer specifies 50x or 100x cards, or whatever.</p><h2>Bus speeds</h2><p>Unfortunately, it takes two to tango. The speed of the card is one factor. The other is the speed at which a particular device can send data to the card. This depends on the speed of the input/output bus that connects them.</p><p>For the first types of card, everybody used a standard bus, so nobody had to worry about it. When speeds reached 10MBps and above (Class 10), we needed a faster bus, so the High Speed Bus was introduced. After that came the Ultra High Speed Bus UHS-I and the even faster UHS-II, which guarantees a minimum data rate of 30MBps. These also have their own logos, with cards being marked U1 or U3.</p><p>As mentioned, some SD cards support speeds of 95MBps or more, but very few applications need such fast cards. A 2MBps card should be able to record standard video, a 4MBps card should record HD (ie 720p) video, and a 6MBps card should handle Full HD (ie 1080p) video, depending on the camera or camcorder.</p><h2>Buying cards</h2><p>For most purposes, you can buy any card that your device supports, and ignore the speed ratings. For example, your camera's spec will say that it takes microSD, microSDHC or microSDXC cards, so just buy whichever type it says. Other things being similar or equal, buy whichever card is faster.</p><p>Not many devices have UHS-I buses at the moment, and usually they are more advanced models. For example, looking at Canon DSLRs, the EOS 500D takes SDHC cards, the 600D can use SDXC cards, and the 650D is the first model that can handle UHS-1 or U1 cards. (The EOS M also sports UHS-1, as do the Nikon D5100 and D7000.)</p><p>In general, I'd avoid buying UHS-1 cards unless your device specifies them, because the new bus has new pins and reassigns some old pins. Cards with both logos – ie C10 and U1 – may work in most (but not all) other devices, but will usually cost more. They still won't write data faster than your camera can send it.</p><p>You could argue that UHS-1 will become common and that people will reap the benefit when they buy new cameras, or whatever. That might be true for people who are planning to buy more advanced devices fairly soon. The rest of us can wait until UHS buses filter down to cheaper devices, by which time, UHS cards will be cheaper.</p><p>I'm not against spending money on SD cards, but I think it's better to spend it on respected name-brand cards and not on cheap ones. As was the case with CD-R discs, not all Flash memory chips are created equal. Personally, I use SanDisk and Samsung cards, but Toshiba, Panasonic, and Lexar Pro and Platinum II cards also have good reputations. Panasonic invented the SD format, and developed it with SanDisk and Toshiba.</p>","headline":"How should I decide which type of SD card to buy?","trailText":"<p><strong>Ask Jack:</strong> Mark is confused by the different classes and speeds of SD cards and wants to know what type he should buy</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2011/10/26/1319634156497/Nokia-Lumia-800-003.jpg","wordcount":"1380","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-12-26T16:06:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/dec/19/sd-card","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2013/dec/19/sd-card","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jackschofield","webTitle":"Jack Schofield","rcsId":"GNL004401","r2ContributorId":"15761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jack_schofield_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jack Schofield is the Guardian's computer editor.

I've recently come across Novatech, who sell operating system-free computers, so I could easily install Debian. But I don't really know whether the difference in price due to the cost of the Windows is noticeable, or whether I'd actually be short-changing myself. <br />I'm a physicist, and I need the machine principally for demonstrating the simulations I'm developing to potential collaborators. Specific requirements are a 15in screen supporting 720p or higher and at least 6GB of RAM. Everything else can be as cheap and slow as they come.</em><br /><strong>Sam Thompson</strong><br /><br />It's generally more expensive to make Linux laptops than to make Windows laptops, and if you're not fussy about brand or the precise specification, you can always find cheap Windows machines at good discounts on Amazon and sites like <a href=\"http://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/\">Laptopsdirect</a> and <a href=\"http://www.saveonlaptops.co.uk/\">SaveOnLaptops</a>.</p><p>Laptop manufacturing is a high-volume business driven by economies of scale, and apart from Apple Macintoshes, Windows has almost all of it. The big manufacturers can buy parts and manufacture machines cheaper than the small ones, and the cost of Windows licences is ameliorated by other factors. These include payments for including pups (potentially unwanted programs, or \"crapware\"), rebates on advertising, and participation in various promotions sponsored by Intel and Microsoft.</p><p>All of the mass market OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are in the business of making Windows machines. They don't create laptops and then decide which operating system to install. You can see this process working when, for example, hundreds of PC manufacturers start to produce Ultrabooks (to an Intel specification) or switch to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\">UEFI</a> instead of BIOS chips (as specified by Microsoft for Windows 8).</p><p>If an OEM wants to ship laptops running Linux then it has to find all the drivers and test all the parts for one or more distros. This costs money. Linux laptops also add an extra burden in terms of stock keeping, tracking, accounting, advertising, end-user support etc. These overheads are relatively expensive because of the small number of machines involved. Finally, there's the problem of which Linux distro to ship. There are more than a hundred, but the choice usually boils down to either Ubuntu or Red Hat. This prompts complaints from people who would prefer Mint or SuSE or, like you, Debian.</p><p>So, my general advice is to buy a Windows laptop -- because you will usually get a better quality product for less money -- and then dual-boot your distro of choice. While you might not like Windows, that's beside the point. Windows runs millions of useful programs (including the vast majority of open source programs) and games, and it supports most printers and other peripherals. Some day you may need Windows, so why not keep it around?</p><h2>Novatech or not?</h2><p>Novatech is a small British supplier, and it offers various laptops with Windows 7 or 8 or with no operating system at all. Its price for Windows 8 is £79.99, which is more than it costs on Amazon.co.uk (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Windows-Standard-WN7-00403-English/dp/B009HI2W66/\">£74.77</a>). It's also more than the Taiwanese OEMs are reportedly paying for Windows 8 and Microsoft Office combined.</p><p>Novatech's base laptop is the <a href=\"http://www.novatech.co.uk/laptop/range/novatechnspiren1556.html\">nSpire N1556</a> with a 15.6in screen, 2.3GHz Intel Pentium 3550M processor, 4GB of memory and 500GB hard drive. This costs £384.98 with no operating system or £464.97 with Windows 8. Upgrading the memory to 8GB adds £66, raising the price to £450.98 with no OS or £530.97 with Windows 8. This isn't cheap but the 3550M, while only branded Pentium, is a reasonably quick processor.</p><p>The more professional <a href=\"http://www.novatech.co.uk/laptop/range/novatechnpron1542\">nPro N1512</a> with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i5-3230 costs £513.60 with no OS or £593.59 with Windows 8, and might be worth a look.</p><p>I've not tested a Novatech laptop, and I can't see any reviews of the nSpire N1556. However, <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Novatech-nFinity-2367-Plus.72930.0.html\">there are a few</a> of the Novatech nFinity 2367 Plus, a cheap Ultrabook. I assume Novatech loaned out a few to get some publicity, though not with particularly good results. It was criticised for its \"very poor screen\" (<a href=\"http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/laptops/374113/novatech-nfinity-2367-plus/\">PC Pro</a>) and for being plasticy: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7GVA8c5xRE\">ComputerActive</a> said the \"build quality was eccentric at best\". <a href=\"http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/laptops/1291453/novatech-nfinity-2367\">Expert Reviews</a> concluded: \"Looks great value, but it's a false economy; big-brand names are better for the money.\"</p><p>Other Novatech laptops may be better, but these reviews don't fill me with confidence about buying one sight unseen.</p><p>A name-brand alternative that also avoids Windows is umiPC's 15.6in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ubuntu-E1-204-i5-3210M-Processor-Graphics/dp/B009UHPM7K/\">Acer Ubuntu E1-204</a> with a 2.5GHz Core i5-3210M, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive and 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for £562.04 at Amazon (reduced from £699.99).</p><p>The E stands for Essentials: this is Acer's \"value\" line, which has the standard Windows screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. This is enough for your 720p requirement, though more upmarket laptops often have higher resolution screens.</p><h2>Windows alternatives</h2><p>The Acer Ubuntu E1 gives us the chance to compare prices with the Acer Aspire E1 laptops that ship with Windows. For example, for slightly less money, you could get an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aspire-E1-571-15-6-inch-Notebook-Windows/dp/B00DUXFET6/\">Acer Aspire E1-571</a> with a 2.6GHz Core i5- 3230M, 8GB of memory, 750GB hard drive and Windows 8 for £539. That's a newer version with a slightly faster processor, twice the RAM and a bigger hard drive for £17.33 less (including delivery), despite the extra cost of Windows 8.</p><p>If you want something cheaper, there's the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acer-15-6-inch-Notebook-Processor-Integrated/dp/B00G48QIV2/\">Acer Aspire E1-572</a> with a 1.6GHz fourth-generation (Haswell) Core i5-4200U, 6GB of memory, 750GB hard drive and Windows 8 for £399.99. If you don't mind a slow processor, you can get this machine with an Intel Celeron 2955U for £279.99 (E1-532), a Pentium 2117U for £299.99 (E1-530), or a Core i3-3217U for £349.99 (E1-570).</p><p>Note that the E1-572's Core i5-4200U is fast but not quite as fast as the Core i5-3230M. The 4200U is a 15W processor designed to run at lower temperatures and to provide long battery life, while the 3230M is a 35W chip designed for mainstream laptops rather than ultraportables. However, the Core i5-4200U is a lot faster than the Pentium 2117U, which is faster than the Celeron 2955U. </p><p>At the time of writing, the Acer Ubuntu E1-204 was in 61,733rd place on Amazon's best-seller list for Computers &amp; Accessories with no user reviews, while the Acer Aspire E1-572 was 173rd with 13 reviews and a rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars. Indeed, the Acer E-1 had three of the top five places in the Laptops list, with the E1-570 second, the E1-572 third and the E1-530 fifth.</p><h2>Think ThinkPad?</h2><p>Other things being equal, I generally recommend Linux users to go for a ThinkPad, as historically these have usually had the best Linux support. IBM ThinkPads were the corporate standard for a couple of decades, and tend to be expensive, but Lenovo (the Chinese company that bought IBM's PC division) has an affordable ThinkPad Edge range.</p><p>You could, for example, get a 15.6in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-ThinkPad-E530C-15-6-inch-Laptop/dp/B00D849ADS/\">Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E530C</a> with a 2.5GHz Intel Core i3-3120M, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive and a 64-bit Windows 7 Pro/Windows 8 Pro DVD for £398.83. This would enable you to wipe the hard drive and install Debian while retaining the option to load either Windows 7 Pro (which includes an XP mode) or Windows 8 Pro if you need them. The drawback is its 4GB of memory, but it does have two memory slots and is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zzpE2R0dbk\">very easy to upgrade</a>. (You can also change the hard drive and the battery.)</p><p>There's also the new Haswell-based <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/edge-series/e540/\">ThinkPad E540</a> range which is replacing the E530.</p><p>Technically you might be happy with a Novatech, but the ThinkPad brand still carries a lot of cachet, and if you are marketing yourself to other people -- which, essentially, you are -- then I think it's worth having. Or you could buy an Acer for less, thanks to the economies of scale generated by Microsoft Windows.</p>","headline":"Linux laptops: should you avoid buying Windows?","trailText":"<p>Sam is looking for a new laptop to run Linux, and wonders if it's worth buying one without an operating system pre-installed</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/columnists/2013/12/13/1386953115321/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Edge-E530-003.jpg","wordcount":"1282","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-12-20T16:49:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/dec/13/linux-laptops-should-you-avoid-buying-windows","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2013/dec/13/linux-laptops-should-you-avoid-buying-windows","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/computing","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jackschofield","webTitle":"Jack Schofield","rcsId":"GNL004401","r2ContributorId":"15761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jack_schofield_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jack Schofield is the Guardian's computer editor.

I've installed <a href=\"http://www.classicshell.net/\">Classic Shell</a>, which mitigates the worst of its \"features\". Now Microsoft is offering Windows 8.1 for FREE. Should I take the offer? I never, ever use tablet features.<br />Thanks as always.</em><br /><strong>David Null</strong><br /><br />Yes. I regard the free Windows 8.1 as an essential update. Microsoft has moved from a three-year upgrade cycle to one that provides more rapid upgrades, and in principle, anyone on Windows 8 or later needs to move with the times and install them when they come out. The next one is due in the spring of 2015. The era of skipping alternate versions and upgrading Windows every six years or so is over, though I don't expect Microsoft to run on a six-monthly (like Linux) or annual (like Mac OS X) cycle.</p><p>Either way, it's a good update. If you like Windows 8, then 8.1 makes it faster and better. The benefits include improved multitasking and multi-monitor support, better apps, and \"universal search\". If you like Windows 7 more than Windows 8, the upgrade to 8.1 provides controls that make it more like Windows 7. It's therefore a Good Thing for people on both sides of the argument.</p><p>The most obvious changes have been made to the Start screen, which works as both a program menu and a notification system. There are now four sizes of tile: small, medium, large and wide. You can group your programs in sets with headings -- the equivalent of folders -- and give your most-used programs bigger tiles.</p><p>You can also pick from a number of Start screen backgrounds, or use a photo. I have the Bliss wallpaper from Windows XP set as both the desktop wallpaper in Windows 8.1 and the Start screen background. This provides a more harmonious shift when toggling between the two, as well as adding a bit of nostalgia.</p><p>Of course, you can still run apps or programs just by typing a few characters, then picking a result from the search list. In this respect, Windows 8 and 8.1 work just like Vista and Windows 7, only better. (Windows XP users could do this by installing <a href=\"http://www.launchy.net/\">Launchy</a>.) </p><p>In 8.1, the Start screen's \"PC settings\" menu covers more settings, so there is less need to use the old Control Panel. This is one area where the Start option is quicker and cleaner, and you're not doing yourself any favours by ignoring it.</p><p>If you don't like the Start screen, you can configure Windows 8.1 to boot straight to the desktop. To do this, type <em>nav</em> into the Search box and click the top option. The old-fashioned desktop approach is to right-click the Taskbar, select Properties, go to the Navigation tab, and check the box that says: \"Go to the desktop instead of Start when I sign in\". Alternatively, you can do it via the Control Panel: look for \"Appearance and Personalization\" or \"Taskbar and Navigation\". </p><p>This does not remove the Start screen, nor does it bring back the old menu system, so you may want to stick with Classic Shell. However, you can bring up a useful menu by pressing the Windows key and X, and this offers more functions in Windows 8.1. You can, for example, run the Task Manager, Control Panel, File Explorer, Windows PowerShell (for a command line) and various other things. This pop-up menu also provides easily accessible restart and shutdown options.</p><p>There are many other improvements to Windows 8.1, including Internet Explorer 11 with WebGL support, deeper integration with SkyDrive, and Skype. Most of the \"tablet\" apps have been improved, including the Bing-based apps (Weather, Finances, News Sports etc), Xbox Music (which now has a free radio feature), and Xbox Video. Since these \"modern\" apps are quick and convenient, I can't see any reason not to use them. They work very well with a mouse with a scroll-wheel, as hundreds of YouTube videos attest.</p><p>Windows 8/8.1 is very innovative and, in Microsoft's favourite phrase, \"fast and fluid\". It does have a learning curve, but if you can be bothered to learn it, it's excellent. Further, as part of the Microsoft ecosystem, it's increasingly being integrated with Windows Phone, Xbox One and Azure/Outlook.com/SkyDrive so you get familiar operations, apps and services across <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stevecla01/archive/2009/05/21/three-screens-and-a-cloud.aspx\">\"three screens and a cloud\"</a>: smartphone, PC, and TV. This is not to be despised, it's the future. </p><h2>Upstairs, downstairs</h2><p><em>I have recently bought a new desktop which runs Windows 8.1. My two-year-old laptop runs Windows 7. My desktop is upstairs and my laptop downstairs. I am 85 and I don't want too much running up and down stairs.<br />Currently, if I look at Blueyonder email messages in Live Mail on the laptop they don't appear on the desktop. I can get them on either PC using webmail.</p><p>1. Can the computers be networked even though they have different Windows programs on them? (My son set up a network when the upstairs computer was Windows XP.) Would it make any difference to the email issue?<br />2. Should I put Windows 8.1 on my laptop? Advantages/disadvantages?</em><br /><strong>Margaret Levy</strong></p><p>Windows Live Mail is a free desktop mail program, which is faster and more powerful than using web-based email, and it handles multiple email accounts. It's very popular on Windows 7 and Vista, but you can still download it and install it in Windows 8.1. If both copies of Windows Live Mail are set up to use the IMAP protocol, then both should download and show the same emails.</p><p>Virgin Media, which operates Blueyonder and other email services, has various help pages to explain how to do it. These include <a href=\"http://help.virginmedia.com/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=2733\">How to use IMAP in Virgin Media Mail</a>, <a href=\"http://help.virginmedia.com/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=2733\">How to configure IMAP for Windows Mail</a> and <a href=\"http://help.virginmedia.com/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=2717\">How do I check my email settings in Windows Live Mail?</a>.</p><p>You can connect your Windows 8.1 desktop to the network that you used with the Windows XP machine, and the process is much the same (except you can no longer right-click on networks to get their properties). It's actually very easy to do, but Microsoft has instructions specifically for Windows 8.1 at <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/add-device-or-pc-to-network\">Add a device or PC to a network</a>.</p><p>Upgrading your Windows 7 laptop to Windows 8.1 will not provide any benefits in terms of networking or your use of Blueyonder email, and in your case, I can't think of any advantages that would be worth the cost. However, I can think of one major disadvantage, which is that you would have to re-install your Windows 7 programs and any devices, such as printers.</p><p>When Microsoft released Windows 8, it provided an easy upgrade to Windows 7. However, Windows 8.1 is a new operating system and Microsoft generally avoids doing two upgrades at once. It would still be simple to upgrade from Windows 7 to 8, and then download the free upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1 from the Windows Store. Unfortunately, if you want to jump from 7 to 8.1, then the options are to keep your personal data files or to keep nothing and do a clean installation. There is no option to keep programs, devices, and personal data files.

Although you could buy a conversion cable like the <a href=\"http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/scart-to-vga-syncblaster-cable-a38bf\">SCART to VGA SyncBlaster</a> (£67.99) -- now discontinued -- to connect a Scart port to LCD screen, the PC option is usually a better bet.<br /> <br />Flat-screen PC monitors are typically used to display digital signals via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface\">DVI</a> or more recently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI\">HDMI</a> ports. Unfortunately, your Dell laptop does not have either of those. It has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector\">VGA</a> connector, which outputs an analogue RGB signal. If you buy an LCD/LED monitor with a VGA port, that should show your videos, but the results will not be as good as if you used a DVI or HDMI connection.<br /> <br />I'm hesitant because I suspect HDCP could be problem with DVD movies (unless you rip them first). Windows 7 and Vista both support HDCP, as do \"HD Ready\" TV sets and presumably HDMI monitors. However, VGA is older than HDCP and I don't know if will carry HDCP to the monitor. If it doesn't, the monitor should display a low-resolution image (480p) or no image at all. That's how it \"protects\" content.<br /> <br />You can buy a VGA to DVI adaptors but a simple plug will not convert analogue VGA to digital DVI. That would need some form of electronic reprocessing, which will also reduce the image quality.</p><h2>New laptop or new DVD player?</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-423991235'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/columnists/2013/11/28/1385656547791/Asus-ports-008.jpg' alt='Asus ports' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Asus MX239H multimedia monitor has two HDMI ports plus a VGA port for older devices</figcaption></figure><p>If you had a desktop PC, you could solve the problem easily by installing a cheap graphics card, but I don't think you can do that with a Dell Inspiron 1545, even if you want to.<br /> <br />If you have a friendly local retailer, try taking your laptop to the shop, connect it to a PC monitor's VGA port, play a DVD and see how it looks. Right-click on your desktop screen, select \"Screen resolution\" from the drop-down menu, and see what the options are for the second screen. Will it work with a vertical resolution of 1080 pixels?<br /> <br />If you still have a friendly local retailer, there may be a simpler, better option. Blu-ray players and some cheap \"upscaling\" DVD players also have HDMI ports, and these should work when plugged directly into the HDMI port on a PC monitor. I have not tried this so I'd like to see it working before handing over the cash. However, if you specifically make the point that it's the purpose of your purchase, you will be covered under the Sale of Goods Act. <a href=\"http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/cgi-bin/shropshire/con1item.cgi?file=*adv0043-1011.txt\">(\"Goods must be fit for their general purpose and any particular purpose that a consumer makes known to the trader at the time of purchase.\")</a><br /> <br />Bear in mind that you will need to buy a Blu-ray or DVD player that does NOT have a built-in Freeview tuner or you will still have to pay for a TV license.<br /> <br />If your current DVD player does not have an HDMI port, then it will be cheaper to buy a new Blu-ray or DVD player than a new laptop.</p><h2>Choosing a monitor</h2><p>When it comes to choosing a PC monitor, the general standard is now very good: they only become expensive if you want a very big screen or a high resolution. Your current laptop has a standard 1366 x 768-pixel display so a monitor that displays 1080p (Full HD) should be a significant improvement.<br /> <br />Bob Raikes, monitor expert and founder of display consultancy <a href=\"http://www.meko.co.uk/\">Meko Ltd</a>, says that \"the better panels will tend to be in sets from 24in and upwards, so size is a part of the choice\". Since almost all TVs with 27in and smaller screens now use monitor panels, Bob says \"fundamentally, there is little difference in reality\". However, he does warn that \"TV viewing tends to need higher brightness, so it's worth checking the brightness of the monitor. Quality TVs have brightness of 500cd/m2 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre\">Candela per square metre</a>), but monitors are typically between 200 and 350cd/m2. If the TV is watched in the daytime and brightish conditions, then it's worth looking for sets with 300 or 350cd/m2. I would recommend a minimum of 250.\"<br /> <br />For convenience, you will probably want a \"multimedia monitor\" with built-in loudspeakers, though these will not be the best speakers. I'd also suggest choosing a monitor with an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel\">IPS</a> (In-plane switching) display, and the more input ports the better.</p><h2>Suggested products</h2><p>Asus, AOC, BenQ all offer good, reasonably priced multimedia monitors. The IPS options include the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/MX239H-Widescreen-Multimedia-SonicMaster-Technology/dp/B00A4K9KVG/\">Asus MX239H</a> 23in widescreen multimedia monitor (£186 at amazon.co.uk) and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/AOC-I2367FH-Widescreen-Multimedia-Kensington/dp/B00A46Y678/\">AOC I2367FH</a> (£136.09). There are also 27in versions of the same models at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/MX279H-Widescreen-Multimedia-SonicMaster-Technology/dp/B00A4K9KBQ/\">£270.95</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/AOC-I2757FH-Widescreen-Multimedia-1920x1080/dp/B00A46Y6DW/\">£206.98</a> respectively, but both have the same 1920 x 1080-pixel resolution.<br /> <br />Cheaper non-IPS options include the 23.6in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/AOC-E2450SWHK-Widescreen-Multimedia-1920x1080/dp/B0096XW6H2/\">AOC E2450SWHK</a> (£111.86) and the 24in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/BenQ-GL2450HM-Widescreen-Multimedia-Monitor/dp/B005OPLG0O/\">BenQ GL2450HM</a> (£115.98) or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/BenQ-GL2460HM-Widescreen-Multimedia-1920x1080/dp/B00AQBWMZ4/\">BenQ GL2460HM</a> (£127.80).<br /> <br />There is a much wider choice of monitors that don't have built-in speakers. Good examples include the 23in Dell <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dell-Ultrasharp-U2312HM-inch-Monitor/dp/B005SNNCEA/\">Dell Ultrasharp U2312HM</a> IPS (£151.63) and the 24in Samsung <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-S24C300HS-inch-HDMI-Monitor/dp/B00CDP6JBE/\">Samsung S24C300HS</a> (£129.55).<br /> <br />Amazon prices are, of course, subject to change.<br /> <br />Finally, if you dispose of everything you own that can receive a TV signal, you can <a href=\"http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/what-if-a-tv-licence-is-not-needed-TOP12/\">tell the TV licensing authority</a> by making a declaration online. You can also apply for a refund for any quarters you have paid in advance. However, the site warns: \"As it is our duty to ensure that everyone in the UK who needs a licence has one, we may visit your address to check that no licence is required. It's unfortunately necessary to do this, as when we make contact on these visits, almost one in five people are found to need a TV Licence.\" In this case, \"you could risk prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000\".</p>","headline":"Can I use a PC monitor to watch DVDs?","trailText":"<p>Kay wants to replace her bulky old TV set with a flat screen for watching movies on DVD.

My role is responsibility for IT, and over the past few years, I have been slowly updating and improving all the hardware and software.  Now it's time for the desktop PC to be replaced, and this is where I am at a bit of a loss. As a Mac user, I have little knowledge of what would be suitable. However, I know that the staff – capable as they are – couldn't cope with a switch to Mac.</p><p>The main requirements for the hardware are:<br />• A good financial investment - reliable quality - takes care of itself.<br />• Future proof/upgradeable (three years or more).<br />• Can handle images, and Microsoft Office for documents, posters, forms etc.</em></p><p><em>For software, I'm also looking for a backup system similar to Time Machine on the Mac, and for newsletters, software that can simply edit photos from iPads and digital cameras. Also, I want an email client to let each staff member log into their own account from the same user profile.</em><br /><strong>Matthew</strong><br /></p><p>There are two ways to approach the hardware. Either you can buy from a global giant that specialises in supplying small businesses and offers on-site service, or you can buy from a small, local shop that also specialises in looking after small businesses. The former is probably the safest course, but the latter is worth considering if you are close to a really good local supplier.</p><p>If you decide to go with a global giant, both HP and Dell supply cheap, reliable, small-tower desktop computers that are easy to repair and upgrade. Their desktops should easily last three years, and six years is more likely. Indeed, I think you should buy a machine that you expect to run until 14 January, 2020, which is when Microsoft will stop supporting Windows 7. This means you can amortise the cost over 300 weeks or 72 months.</p><h2>HP or Dell?</h2><p>From HP's range, I would go for the <a href=\"http://h20386.www2.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=ECC_BUNDLE_4183567&amp;opt=&amp;sel=PBDT\">HP 3500 Pro Microtower PC &amp; HP 23bw IPS LED backlit monitor</a>. This has a third generation Intel Core i5-3470 quad-core processor with 4GB of memory, a 500GB hard drive, and 64-bit Windows 7. The closest I can find after wrestling with HP's Swedish site is the <a href=\"http://h20386.www2.hp.com/SwedenStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=ECC_BUNDLE_3867824&amp;opt=&amp;sel=PBDT&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_sesv_c-001_title_r0001\">HP Pro 3500 MT (C5X65EA)</a>. Note that you will want to add a Care Pack to provide three years of next business day on-site service. </p><p>\"Defective Media Retention\" means you get to keep the hard drive if something goes wrong with it. This is highly recommended for data protection purposes. It's even more recommended if the drive contains data about nursery school children.</p><p>From Dell's range, I would go for the <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/vostro-270/pd?oc=sbd2719&amp;model_id=vostro-270&amp;#overrides=\">Vostro 270MT</a>. This has the same specification as the HP machine, including the Core i5-3470 processor. Again, go for three years of Pro (rather than Basic) support. I bought a similar but slightly bigger machine two years ago -- a Dell Vostro 460DT with a Core i5-2500 -- but included an Nvidia GeForce GT 420 graphics card. The 270MT lacks this and will use main memory for graphics, but it should not be a problem for your purposes. In any case, it's easy to add a cheap graphics card or extra memory later.</p><p>The third-generation Core i5-3470 is quite a bit faster than, for example, a fourth-generation Haswell Core i7-4600U. Being in a desktop tower, it can run hotter than would be possible in a thin laptop (in this case, 77 Watts vs 15 Watts).</p><h2>Windows and Office</h2><p>There are several reasons for getting 64-bit Windows 7 Pro. First, the desktop interface should be an easier step up, compared to Windows 8, for those not already familiar with it. Second, it will be supported until 2020, as mentioned, and it's not going to change, though you should keep updating to newer browsers. Third, Microsoft allows you to run a free virtual copy of Windows XP under Windows 7 Pro, if you have some reason for doing that. Fourth, you're actually buying a copy of Windows 8 with a downgrade to Windows 7 Pro, so you could upgrade to Windows 8 free of charge, if you wanted to.</p><p>You don't mention which version of Microsoft Office you have, but if you have the DVDs, you can install the old copy on your new PC. If not, I would buy a DVD copy of Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010. There are some advantages to the new Office 2013, particularly the wealth of templates and the live preview options that make it much easier to make documents look nice. Also, you can synchronise Office 2013 with Outlook.com web-based email without using the old <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx\">Microsoft Office Outlook Hotmail Connector</a>. However, 2010 is more likely to be familiar to existing users of Office 2007 and 2010. (You don't need to be at the \"leading edge\", but nor should you fall too far behind.)</p><p>Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010 includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook, which should take care of most of your office needs. Everyone should use the same Microsoft Outlook account for all nursery business email, contacts book and calendar, and Outlook can also be used to organise meetings and keep to-do lists. Staff should not use it to send personal emails: they can use their own web-based mail accounts, such as Google's Gmail or Microsoft's Outlook.com. Of course, you should remind them not to store their passwords in shared web browsers.</p><p>This version of Office does not include Microsoft Publisher, but Word already includes simple photo editing tools. Once you have pasted in a photo, you can crop and rotate it, change brightness and contrast, and add effects, including soft edges. I prefer to edit copies of photos first, but the free <a href=\"http://www.getpaint.net/\">Paint.net</a> is powerful enough for most ordinary purposes. You don't need Microsoft Publisher (which is included in bigger versions of Office) because you can use the free <a href=\"http://www.serif.com/desktop-publishing-software/\">Serif PagePlus Starter Edition</a> instead. <a href=\"http://www.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus\">Scribus</a> is a free, open source alternative, but harder to use.</p><h2>Backup strategies</h2><p>Windows 7 already has easy-to-use <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/backup-and-restore\">backup and restore</a>, which includes scheduled backups. If you buy a Dell, you may find it includes a similar but unnecessary program, <a href=\"http://dslbdownload.datasafelocalbackup.com/dsldownload-en.html\">Dell DataSafe Local Backup</a>, which tries to get you to upgrade to a premium version.</p><p><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427\">Time Machine</a> keeps hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly backups until your backup drive is full. I can't think of a PC product that does the same thing out of the box, but there are plenty of options that keep earlier versions of files, if you set them up. <a href=\"http://www.rollbacksoftware.com/#overviewContent\">RollBack RX</a> ($69) and <a href=\"http://www.genie9.com/business/Genie_Timeline_Pro/overview.aspx\">Genie Timeline Professional 2013</a> (£44.95) seem closest to Time Machine. 2BrightSparks' <a href=\"http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/sbpro-features.html\">SyncBack Pro</a> (£37.48) should also do everything you need, as long as you watch out for running out of drive space. Altaro's <a href=\"http://www.altaro.com/professional-pc-backup/\">BackupFS</a> (£79) is another option, though it's really designed for servers. However, I'm going by spec sheets: I haven't used any of these programs myself.</p><p>The more obvious way of backing things up to an external hard drive is to use a free file synchronisation program. I'd go for either 2BrightSparks' <a href=\"http://www.2brightsparks.com/download-syncbackfree.html\">SyncBackFree V6.5</a> or the open source <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/freefilesync/\">FreeFileSync</a> (which is the one I use) rather than Microsoft's popular <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15155\">SyncToy 2.1</a>. </p><p>Windows 7 already has System Protection turned on by default for the C: drive, so right-clicking on any file offers the menu option to \"Restore previous versions\". Otherwise, <a href=\"http://beanland.net.au/autover/\">AutoVer</a> freeware provides a really simple way to keep real-time backups of multiple versions of files. Windows 7's backup program can create a disk image as a VHD (Virtual Hard Drive) file that is a complete, mountable clone of your PC. That plus some free file syncing may be all you need.</p><p>There are lots of other useful free programs for Windows, but that's a different question, if someone wants to ask it ...</p>","headline":" Which PC should I buy to run a small business?","trailText":"<p><strong>Jack Schofield: </strong>Matthew looks after IT for a parent-run nursery and is looking for a reliable, trouble-free desktop PC</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/gallery/2013/11/21/1385051355541/HP-PC-003.jpg","wordcount":"1307","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-11-28T17:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/nov/21/which-pc-run-small-business-microsoft","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2013/nov/21/which-pc-run-small-business-microsoft","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/blog","webTitle":"Technology blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog","references":[]},{"id":"technology/microsoft","webTitle":"Microsoft","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/microsoft","references":[]},{"id":"technology/software","webTitle":"Software","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/software","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/software","references":[]},{"id":"technology/dell","webTitle":"Dell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/dell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/dell","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows","webTitle":"Windows","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows-7","webTitle":"Windows 7","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows-7","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows-7","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows-8","webTitle":"Windows 8","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows-8","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows-8","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jackschofield","webTitle":"Jack Schofield","rcsId":"GNL004401","r2ContributorId":"15761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jack_schofield_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jack Schofield is the Guardian's computer editor.

However, the Lumix DMC-SZ3 is a couple of millimetres smaller, and on the Amazon links you provided, dramatically cheaper (£84 vs £140).</p><p>Choosing between the Lumix DMC-SZ3 and the Canon Powershot SX240 HS is harder, and I think you would be happy with either. I'd lean towards the SX240 as this is something of a modern classic – along with the SX260 HS, which is the same camera with built-in GPS. There are better Lumix cameras, but compared with the DMC-SZ3, the Powershot SX240 has a better screen and a longer optical zoom (20x vs 10x), plus an HDMI port.</p><p>I would expect the Powershot SX240 to produce slightly better photos, with less noise. You might think the Lumix DMC-SZ3 would be better because it's a 16 megapixel camera whereas the SX240 HS only offers 12MP, but the reverse is more likely, given that the sensor sizes are the same. (If someone out there can produce comparison shots, that would be nice.) As Apple said, with some justification, at the iPhone 5S launch: \"bigger pixels = better picture\".</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.chip.de/artikel/Panasonic-Lumix_DMC-SZ3-Digitalkamera-Test_63365305.html\">German review of the Lumix DMC-SZ3</a> suggests the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-WB30F-Camera-Built-In-Connectivity/dp/B00B3TM4W4/\">Samsung WB30F</a> \"smart camera\" (£94) as a better option, and I'd tend to agree. I've been using Samsung compacts for the past couple of years, though both models (a <a href=\"http://www.trustedreviews.com/Samsung-WB2000_Digital-Camera_review\">WB2000</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-WB750-14-6-Optical-inch/dp/B005LC1Q7I/\">WB750</a>) have had Schneider Kreuznach rather than Samsung zoom lenses. They are very solid and have worked well. The only minor foible was when the WB750 lens stopped zooming, which was cured by removing and then replacing the battery. (Also, it only cost me £95 in Jessops when the SX240 HS was around twice the price.)</p><h2>Stepping up to \"mirrorless\"</h2><p>Whether it's worth stepping up to a Nikon J1 or J2 is an interesting question. There's no doubt that digital compact cameras are being squeezed from below by smartphone cameras, and the Nokia Lumia 1120 probably outperforms most cheap compacts. If you are going on holiday or to a special event, a so-called \"travel zoom\" like the Powershot SX240 wins every time. You get more shooting range and better quality from the 20x zoom lens, better image quality from the larger sensors, better flash exposures, and better battery life. However, if you are just snapping your lunch for Facebook, none of those things matters.</p><p>To get a significant step up in quality means using a bigger image sensor, which means using bigger lenses that gather more light. Both of those cost money. This is where a new type of digital camera enters the picture. They're often called mirrorless cameras, or interchangeable lens cameras (ILCs), or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system\">Micro Four Thirds</a> (MFT), after the sensor size used by Olympus and Panasonic.</p><p>Really, the naming depends whether you are looking up or down. For smartphone and compact camera owners looking for something better, the key differentiator is interchangeable lenses, so ILC makes sense. For digital SLR owners looking for something smaller and lighter, the lack of a blinking mirror is the significant difference. (SLRs already have interchangeable lenses.) Either way, ILCs are not a new kind of camera at all. They're the digital heirs of the Leica and Contax rangefinder cameras that were the staple of photojournalists from the 1930s to the 1980s, and in some cases the present day.</p><p>The Nikon 1 J2 provides a significant step up in the imaging department: it has a 1\" sensor generating 10 megapixels. The actual dimensions are 13.2 x 8.8mm (116 sq mm) compared with the Canon Powershot SX240's 6.17 x 4.55mm (28 sq mm). In other words, the image sensor is four times the size. It's also very good value at the current lowest price, which is £199.99 from Argos or Jessops, with the standard 10-30mm lens. It used to sell for £500.</p><p>However, you could find the 3x optical zoom range a bit restrictive, so have a look for a bundle that includes a 30-110mm lens as well. According to the site I always consult, <a href=\"http://www.camerapricebuster.co.uk/Nikon/Nikon-1-Cameras/Nikon-1-J2-%2B-10-30mm-%26-30-110mm-Lenses\">Camera Price Buster</a>, the lowest price for a J2 two-lens outfit is £299.99, but it's pink.</p><p>You could also consider the older Nikon 1 J1 model, which has the same basic specification. The main advantages of the J2 are its much better screen (twice the pixels), aluminium-finish body, Creative Mode, and slow-motion video. The J1 should therefore be cheaper, but according to Camera Price Buster, it isn't.</p><h2>Bigger sensors</h2><p>Although the Nikon 1 J2 is a terrific all-round family camera with a relatively large sensor, it has been criticised for having too small a sensor. Photographers who are trading down from DSLRs rather than moving up from phones are usually looking for the extra quality delivered by Micro Four Thirds and APS-C sensors.</p><p>With this in mind, the options include the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-EOS-Compact-System-Camera/dp/B008O0IAKK/\">Canon EOS M</a> (£349), <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-NEX3NL-Interchangeable-Lens-Camera/dp/B00BHXVU6M/\">Sony NEX3NL</a> (£294.99), <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-DMC-GF6KEB-K-Compact-System-Camera/dp/B00CBF4KJO/\"> Lumix G DMC-GF6</a> (£359) and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-NX1000-Digital-Compact-System/dp/B007WR32HW/\">Samsung NX1000</a> (£259.99).</p><p>The Canon EOS M, for example, has an APS-C sensor, which measures 22.3 x 14.9mm (332 sq mm). This is more than 10 times the size of the sensor in the Canon Powershot SX240 HS (28 sq mm). For smartphone buffs, the comparable round numbers are 58 sq mm for the Nokia Lumia 1020's 2/3\" sensor and 17 sq mm for the iPhone 5S's 1/3\" sensor.</p><p>Of course, there's not much point in having the extra quality if you only look at pictures on screens and never have photo albums printed out. Also, there's not much point in having a camera with interchangeable lenses if you only own or use one lens. However, extra wide-angle and telephoto lenses cost money, and reduce pocketability.</p><p>ILCs can certainly provide high quality results, and they do it at relatively low prices compared to DSLRs or even smartphones like the iPhone 5S (£549 to £709). But travel zoom compacts like the Canon Powershot SX240 HS do what most people need for a much lower price.</p>","headline":" Which pocket camera should I buy for holidays?","trailText":"<p>Dhiren wants for a new pocket camera for holidays.

Google Classic is a very poor substitute. What can I do?</em><br /><strong>Michael Ayton</strong><br /><br />Google has just closed iGoogle, its personal start page, but it made the announcement last summer, leaving alternative sites plenty of time to pitch for its former users. That's also what happened with the closing of Google Reader, but I haven't seen the same outpourings of anger and grief, or the same search for new homes, from iGoogle users. It would be interesting to know how many there were.</p><p>I did like iGoogle, and it was the first site I covered when I started writing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/23/news.searchengines\">weekly Netbytes column</a> on the Guardian's website six years ago. It's perhaps less important now that browsers include thumbnails of your most-used pages, and you can easy add websites and apps to your Windows 8 Start page.</p><p>If you want something as much like iGoogle as possible, then <a href=\"http://www.ighome.com/\">igHome</a> is the first start page to try. It actually bills itself as the \"iGoogle Alternative\", and it still has the black menu bar for Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Images, Google News etc that Google so foolishly removed from its Search home page. It also has a Google search box, and it shows search results without the plethora of adverts you get with Google.</p><p>igHome is a bit boxy, but there are plenty of \"gadgets\" -- almost 200,000 -- albeit nearly all of them are RSS feeds.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ustart.org/#Home\">uStart</a> is a less-boxy attempt to replace iGoogle, and it has tabs but not a black menu bar. One of the tabs is an RSS reader that looks like a decent replacement for Google Reader, so this may appeal if you consume a lot of RSS feeds. Its search box also uses Google Custom Search, but results come with plenty of adverts as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://my.yahoo.com/\">My Yahoo</a> is another obvious alternative. It was around before Google launched iGoogle, and has many of the same features. Like igHome and others, it offers to import your iGoogle settings, if you saved them. Of course, its menu bar links to Yahoo's email, news and other services, not the Google equivalents, so it's not as useful if you don't use Yahoo. (There is a Gmail widget.)</p><p>My Yahoo has recently been redesigned, but I think my My Yahoo page looks horrible, and it would just take too much work to fix it. I also find the redesigned Yahoo Mail almost unusable, and I don't even like the redesigned Flickr. I'm not sure who Yahoo is aiming at nowadays. It might be you, but it's obviously not me.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.netvibes.com/\">NetVibes</a> is another pioneering start page or dashboard. It's really aimed at large businesses, and last year, it was taken over by the French giant, Dassault Systèmes. However, it does have an \"I'm just Me\" version with three options: Basic (free), VIP ($3.50 per month) and Premium ($499 per month). The VIP option provides support, while the Premium option includes analytics. Pick the Basic version and you have a choice of preconfigured dashboards including \"G refugee\". </p><p>Of all the startpage sites, Netvibes has made the most concerted effort to attract iGoogle readers, with a <a href=\"http://blog.netvibes.com/netvibes-a-new-home-for-igoogle-users/\">series of blog posts</a> and help for developers to <a href=\"http://blog.netvibes.com/uwa-documentation-remake-your-igoogle-gadgets-for-netvibes/\">remake their iGoogle gadgets</a>. The \"G refugee\" option looks like an excellent substitute for iGoogle, and it includes an RSS reader page that replaces the now defunct Google Reader. </p><p>Netvibes has a reputation for being somewhat hard to use, and if you start from scratch, it can take a long time to get things set up. The \"G refugee\" button seems to solve that problem in the short term, so I'm impressed. But if you plan to add tabs for more specialised purposes, you may have to grapple with native Netvibes.</p><p>Finally, there's <a href=\"http://protopage.com/\">Protopage</a>. This is a relatively small, independent operation but it has been attracting switchers from iGoogle over the past couple of years, including me. It doesn't look a bit like iGoogle, and it's missing loads of widgets: there's no Facebook, for example, no translations, and no Gmail. You have to set email up yourself. If you particularly valued iGoogle's vast collection of widgets, then Protopage is not for you.</p><p>On the other hand, Protopage is lightweight, very easy to use, and is a good way to track the most recent seven stories on news sites. This is the main reason I use it, and the reason my Protopage has two columns instead of a more flexible three, four or even five. It also has a handy search box and a set of common links in the search bar across the top: Google, Bing, Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia, Amazon, Twitter, YouTube etc. This makes it very easy to search for the same word or phrase across several the different sites. (If you don't like the sites on the search bar, you can change them, and you can change their order.) Finally, you can set Protopage as the home page on your browser.</p><p>Several personalised start pages have vanished since I last looked at this area, including LinkedFeed and the well-regarded PageFlakes, so I sense the whole category is in decline. It certainly doesn't go well with modern trends. The real value of a start page comes from packing a lot of different types of information into a single screen, and a big desktop monitor delivers the maximum value, whereas the trend is towards small, mobile screens. On mobiles, of course, the smartphone's main screen is already a start page, and Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 are obviously part of the same trend. (If you don't have Windows 8, you can add <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-new-tab-page/mgmiemnjjchgkmgbeljfocdjjnpjnmcg\">Awesome New Tab Page</a> to Google Chrome. Firefox users could try <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/\">New Tab Tools</a> or a similar utility.)</p><p>If you check out the websites I've mentioned, I think you will find at least one that appeals to you, even if you don't love it as much as iGoogle. The choice is probably between igHome and Netvibes' \"G refugee\", with Protopage offering a different approach that you might love or hate.</p>","headline":"iGoogle: what are the best alternatives?","trailText":"<p><strong>Ask Jack: </strong>Now Google has shut down iGoogle, Michael is looking for another way to personalise his start page</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/11/7/1383837235799/Netvibes-003.jpg","wordcount":"1000","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-12-07T18:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/nov/07/igoogle-alternatives","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2013/nov/07/igoogle-alternatives","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"technology/searchengines","webTitle":"Search engines","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/searchengines","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/searchengines","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jackschofield","webTitle":"Jack Schofield","rcsId":"GNL004401","r2ContributorId":"15761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jack_schofield_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jack Schofield is the Guardian's computer editor.

He didn't install them, so how did they get there and how can he remove them?","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>I recently updated Firefox, registered my free copy of Ad-Aware, and updated CCleaner. I then found two unwanted programs installed on my PC. One was Mobius (?), to do with mobile apps, and the other was My PC Backup, both of which I did not consciously download, and certainly never gave permission to be installed. The installation even included desktop shortcut icons! <br />My questions are: how were these programs downloaded, how did they install themselves without my permission, and how do I prevent further downloads of unwanted software programs?</em><br /><br />The vast majority of unwanted programs are either pre-installed when you buy a PC, or were bundled with a download that you wanted. A few are \"drive by\" installations, where malware is installed on the fly by infected websites. These almost always exploit a security hole in your PC's software. At the moment, the weakest link is Oracle Java in the browser. </p><p>I can't tell what has happened in this case, but all the programs you installed should have been registered with Windows' Add/Remove Programs utility. Go to the Windows 7 Control Panel, select \"Programs\" and click \"Uninstall or change a program\". The listing tells you the name of the program, the publisher, and the date it was installed. It should also be able to uninstall the program.</p><p>If Mobius and My PC Backup are not listed, check the dates when their shortcut icons were created. To do this, right-click the desktop icon, select \"Properties\" from the dropdown list, and click the \"General\" tab. This will tell you the date and time it was created, which is easier than finding the folder creation dates in Windows Explorer.</p><p>Next, click the \"Installed on\" heading in the Windows 7 uninstaller to sort the list by date, and see if any programs have the same date and time stamps as your rogues. This could show which of your downloads installed the unwanted programs. </p><p>I don't believe Mozilla would ever foist another program on you on principle, and because of its lucrative search deal with Google, it doesn't need the money. If you download CCleaner directly from <a href=\"http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard\">Piriform</a>, then it does include some foistware in the form of Google Chrome and the Google Toolbar for Internet Explorer. Google pays for foistware installations, which helps cover the cost of the free version of CCleaner, but the installation isn't deceptive. You can decline it by unticking the boxes. Lavasoft's Ad-Aware includes a toolbar and has previously bundled Blekko, but it's not generally known for foistware.</p><h2>Sources of foistware</h2><p>Of course, it's possible that one your chosen downloads has been repackaged by another site to include foistware that neither Mozilla nor Piriform knows about. It's therefore very important to download programs only via the original website, or from a trustworthy source such as <a href=\"http://allmyapps.com/\">All My Apps</a>. As when applying for passports etc, be extremely wary of Google links and Google adverts, <a href=\"http://blog.dynamoo.com/2013/10/google-ads-and-fff7ed-whats-wrong-with.html\">especially if you find it hard to distinguish between the two</a>. There are plenty of scammers who would happily charge you for free programs such as CCleaner and Firefox, or use them to install things you don't want.</p><p>But people usually install foistware by two other methods. First, the unwanted program is presented in such a way that you can easily miss it. I've been caught out by Adobe, and <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/a-close-look-at-how-oracle-installs-deceptive-software-with-java-updates-7000010038/\">Oracle can be appalling</a>. The only cure is vigilance. </p><p>Second, the unwanted program may be hidden from view. For example, if you click on the \"normal\" installation then you'll get the program you asked for plus one or two you didn't, such as the Ask toolbar. You should always click the \"Custom\" or \"Advanced\" installation button, which should allow you to untick any foistware programs you don't want. Of course, if you're dealing with a rogue package, it will install whatever it likes even if you tell it not to.</p><p>If you have any doubts, open the installation program (eg. ccsetup407.exe for CCleaner) in a <a href=\"http://www.sandboxie.com/\">Sandboxie</a> sandbox, which prevents it from making any changes to your PC. After you have seen what it wants to do, you can either move the installation program out of the sandbox or go to <a href=\"http://alternativeto.net/\">AlternativeTo.net</a> and pick a different program. There are usually several good alternatives.</p><p>\"Drive by\" attacks are mainly used to install small bits of malware rather than things that look like utilities. You can avoid almost all of these attacks by installing the latest security patches from Microsoft and, more importantly, other software suppliers such as Oracle, Adobe and Apple. I use Secunia's free <a href=\"http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/\">Personal Software Inspector</a> (PSI) to check for and install updates. It's worth remembering that most malware attacks use popular \"exploit kits\" such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackhole_exploit_kit\">Blackhole</a>, which try to exploit holes that were fixed months or even years ago.</p><p>Exploit kits typically target old versions of browsers and popular browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Acrobat and Oracle's Java. For this reason, I recommend uninstalling all versions of Java from your PC to see if you can avoid using it. If you must have it, make sure you only have the latest version installed, and that there are no earlier versions on your hard drive.</p><h2>Removing unwanted programs</h2><p>Ordinarily, unwanted programs are not hard to uninstall. You can do it using Windows, as mentioned above, or a third party program such as CCleaner or SlimCleaner. If you suspect something will be harder to uninstall than normal, use <a href=\"http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html\">Revo Uninstaller</a> instead.</p><p>I think CCleaner should be able to uninstall My PC Backup, if it's a legitimate program. To try this, click the \"Tools icon\" and check the \"Uninstall\" listing for your unwanted programs. My recommendation, however, is to download the free version of <a href=\"http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/\">Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a> (MBAM) to your desktop and run a quick scan. MBAM is good at removing stuff that your usual antivirus software has missed or thinks is a legitimate program. (Real malware doesn't usually install icons on your desktop.)</p><p>In August, someone <a href=\"https://forums.malwarebytes.org/index.php?showtopic=130988\">complained to Malwarebytes</a>, saying: \"I am the Product Manager for MyPC Backup, recently a customer has reported MalwareBytes is reporting our application as Malware\". (He described it as \"an automated backup tool\".) Malwarebytes responded that it was reported as a PUP or potentially unwanted program \"and not malware or malicious\". In a <a href=\"http://blog.malwarebytes.org/news/2013/07/malwarebytes-adopts-aggressive-pup-policy/\">blog post</a> on the general issue, the company says: \"Malwarebytes feels most of our users have no knowledge that these PUPs were installed and would like them removed.\" This fits your case exactly.</p><p>PUP was coined by MacAfee, and the acronym is now used by AVG, Avast, Lavasoft and many others.</p><p>So, Malwarebytes may be able to remove your PUPs whether they are legitimate programs or malware. If not, the <a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.com/antivirus-removal-tool?form=1\">Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool</a> is also worth a go, before resorting to a help forum such as <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/\">Bleeping Computer</a> or <a href=\"http://www.wilderssecurity.com/index.php\">Wilders</a>.</p><p>Note that in this case, we're assuming your PC is infected in some way and we're trying to remove malware, not to replace your current anti-virus product or provide long-term, full-time protection.</p><h2>Prevention</h2><p>How do you prevent it happening again? I've already mentioned keeping software and security patches up to date, which today is mostly an automated process. I've mentioned being vigilant and only downloading stuff from trusted sites. This should preclude falling for \"social engineering\" attacks such as downloading a new media player or codec to see a sexy/funny/personal video or whatever. You should also be vigilant about free music and free wallpaper offers, because those are the most obvious ways for scammers to bait their hooks.</p><p>Upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 or Windows 8 is another important step in making your PC more secure, but you've done that already. Anyone still using XP should plan to move <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx\">before 8 April 2014</a>, when Microsoft stops patching this antique operating system, and malware writers will be able to run riot. </p><p>Companies may be able to avoid the worst by using Group Policy to lock down their PCs, and in theory, you could do this with Local Group Policy in Windows 7. See Microsoft's guide, <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786941%28v=ws.10%29.aspx\">How Software Restriction Policies Work</a>. Anyone who fancies a go can watch a training program on YouTube, such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6i-iNzt43g\">Windows 7 Software Restriction Policies - Microsoft 70-680: 3.3</a>.</p>","headline":"Windows PUPs: how do I remove potentially unwanted programs?","trailText":"<p>Alan found two unwanted programs on his PC.

We have promised him a laptop as a reward for completing the course but are not sure which is best. He will use it primarily for school work but also to play Minecraft, which is a bit of an obsession. I don't want him complaining of 'lag' as this will cause him anxiety. <br />We were looking mainly at netbook-size machines as he is eight, but I looked at your recommended Asus 200E and the screen seems too small, so now we're looking at the Samsung Activbook 9, Acer Aspire S7 and Lenovo U330. Or another? We were hoping not to pay over £300 but are flexible if you advise to go for a higher spec.</em><br /><strong>Ed</strong><br /><br />It looks as though the \"best laptop for a child\" market has been overtaken by the \"best tablet for a child\" market, particularly for younger children. This has been reinforced by the decline of the netbook market, with Microsoft killing off Windows XP and declining to provide an ultra low cost version of Windows 8 to run on them. Indeed, it looks as though Arm-based tablets, laptops and hybrids running Windows RT are Microsoft's preferred solution for this market, though the market has yet to agree.</p><p>At the moment, hybrids like the Dell Venue 11 Pro, or the smaller Venue 8 Pro, look ideal for kids, because they work as both tablets and laptops. They are much like the Microsoft Surface Pro but cheaper because Intel Atom-powered. In your case, a tablet/hybrid is probably not the best solution. You're looking for a laptop that will help your son to exploit his new typing skills and play Minecraft, and presumably other games.</p><p>Minecraft is a Java program, which enables it to run on different platforms: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. There's also an <a href=\"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Minecraft-Xbox-360-Edition/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584111f7?nosplash=1&amp;DownloadType=Game\">Xbox 360</a> version and a <a href=\"https://minecraft.net/pocket\">Pocket Edition</a> for Apple's iOS and Google Android. Unfortunately, Java programs have a reputation for being slow – deservedly, in my experience – which suggests getting the fastest PC you can afford. </p><h2>Laptops for Minecraft</h2><p>I did a few searches to find the best laptop for running Minecraft. It seems to be a hot topic but one where there's no consensus. There's not even much useful information to be gained from Gamepedia's <a href=\"http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hardware_performance\">user benchmarks</a> beyond the obvious point that the results are extremely variable. However, the Minecraft Support Center's <a href=\"https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/325948-minecraft-system-requirements\">\"recommended system\"</a> makes it clear that the processor is less important than the graphics card. For the processor, it recommends an \"Intel Pentium D or AMD Athlon 64 (K8) 2.6 GHz\" – a low bar – while for the graphics it recommends a \"GeForce 6xxx or ATI Radeon 9xxx and up with OpenGL 2.1 Support (Excluding Integrated Chipsets)\".</p><p>The Support Center adds: \"If you have a laptop with a built-in (integrated) graphics card, rather than a dedicated card, it is highly suggested that you try the <a href=\"http://minecraft.net/demo\">demo</a> before purchase.\"</p><p>The problem is that most cheap laptops have integrated graphics, not dedicated graphics cards. Intel HD3000 integrated graphics are probably enough on a desktop PC, but HD3000 integrated graphics are much less capable on slow, mobile processors. I wouldn't want to recommend this without trying one. </p><p>A processor with HD4000 integrated graphics would be a better bet, which means a third-generation Intel Core iX chip, code-named Sandy Bridge. However, as <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-4000.69168.0.html\">Notebookcheck</a> warns: \"Depending on the processor model, the base and turbo clock rate may differ greatly resulting in different graphics performance of ULV parts compared to high end quad-core parts.\"</p><p>In other words, HD4000 in mobile or ultra-low voltage (ULV) chips is not going to perform as well as HD4000 in fast but hot desktop processors. A thin Ultrabook designed for low battery life and minimal fan use will probably not be the best choice.</p><h2>Some options</h2><p>The cheapest Core-based laptop I can see with HD4000 graphics is a 15.6-inch Asus X550CA-XO266H with a 1.4GHz Core i3, 4GB of memory and a 500GB hard drive for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ECBT63A/\">£364.39 at Amazon.co.uk</a>, or £585.10 with a Core i5. If you're going to spend that much on a PC with Intel integrated graphics, then the red Asus K55A-SX376H would be a better option. That gets you a much faster 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-3210M with 6GB or memory and a 500GB hard drive for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009YUF87M/\">£498</a>.</p><p>The Core i5 also has a SpeedStep feature – which increases the clock speed when needed – that the Core i3 lacks.</p><p>The Lenovo U330, which you mention, has a fourth-generation Haswell processor, a Core i5-4200U, but it has a slower clock speed (1.6GHz) and the same HD4000 graphics for a higher price: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-U330-13-3-inch-Touchscreen-Laptop/dp/B00DPERVS2/\">£634.53</a>. It's a nicer laptop and has a touch screen, but I wouldn't expect it to run Minecraft better. The Core i5-4200U provides better battery life, but it's not as fast as a Core i3-3110M or even a Pentium G860.</p><p>The Samsung ATIV Book 9 Lite, which you also mention, is best avoided for your son's purposes. It's attractive as a cheap Ultrabook with an SSD (solid-state disk) drive. However, the 1GHz-1.4GHz AMD A6-1450 processor is designed for very low power consumption (8W) and it's extremely slow. A modern Celeron or Pentium chip, such as the 987, would be faster. (PC Pro has a <a href=\"http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/laptops/383779/samsung-ativ-book-9-lite\">review</a>.)</p><h2>Laptops with graphics cards</h2><p>Stepping up to laptop with a built-in graphics card, as recommended for Minecraft, usually involves a step up in price, and a dramatic reduction in the number of options available. However, HP, Dell and some other firms have more affordable options.</p><p>For example, the 14in HP EliteBook 8460p has a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-2520M processor, 4GB of memory and a fast (7200rpm) 320GB hard drive. The second-generation processor is saved by the Radeon HD 6470M graphics with 1GB of memory. The Amazon price is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/EliteBook-Widescreen-7200rpm-graphics-Ethernet/dp/B005GIZO52/\">£599.99</a>, which is twice your preferred budget.</p><p>The EliteBook 8460p ships with 64-bit Windows 7 Professional, but check if this includes Windows 8. Business laptops are sold with Windows 8 Pro, partly because this includes downgrade rights to Windows 7 Pro, which is the business standard. This means there's a \"free\" upgrade to Windows 8 if required. (I notice that Acer is shipping business laptops in the UK with both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8 Pro, so you can choose which you want when you set it up.)</p><p>There's also the <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/uk/p/inspiron-15r-se-7520/pd?oc=cn15s02&amp;model_id=inspiron-15r-se-7520\">Dell Inspiron 15R Special Edition</a>, which seems to be aimed at the back-to-school market. This has a third-generation 2.6GHz Core i5-3230M with 4GB of memory, plus a <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Radeon-HD-7730M.72678.0.html\">Radeon HD 7730M</a> graphics card with its own 2GB of memory, for £499, including a year's in-home service.</p><p>The Inspiron 15 is big and a bit clunky – my son has owned two of them, and I bought the first – but they are generally good value workhorses.</p><p>The best value I can find today is the Fujitsu Lifebook AH532. This has a 2.4GHz Core i3-3110M processor with 4GB of memory and an Nvidia GeForce GT 620M graphics card with 1GB of memory for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fujitsu-Lifebook-AH532-15-6-inch-Laptop/dp/B00F36LAT6/\">£374.94</a>, as sold by Amazon. The normal price seems to be around £470. However, I've never seen this machine, and it would be a good idea to read a few <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Fujitsu-Lifebook-AH532-Notebook.81495.0.html\">reviews</a>. Get a hands-on if you can.</p><p>If you search for laptops with (roughly) 2GHz or faster Intel Core i3 or i5 processors with HD4000 graphics and/or dedicated Nvidia GeForce or AMD/ATI Radeon graphics, then you may be able to find something better.</p><p>This spec should be capable of running Minecraft reasonably well, though not with the highest frame rates, and probably not with the Fancy graphics option turned on.</p><p>Incidentally, you asked for a laptop, but a desktop is usually a better option for gaming. Desktop processors can be run hot, often from 95W (like my Core i5-2500K) to 130W, whereas laptops are trending down from 35W to 15W or less. This means <a href=\"http://www.bit-tech.net/blog/2013/05/25/don-t-be-fooled-by-laptop-cpus/\">a cheap desktop processor can often outperform a \"higher spec\" laptop chip</a>. A desktop tower case also provides room for high-powered but relatively cheap graphics cards, which are very easy to upgrade. Finally, you can fit a much better keyboard and a bigger screen.</p>","headline":"What's the best laptop for a child ... who plays Minecraft?","trailText":"<p>Ed wants a laptop for his eight-year-old son.

If you are a typical home user, you can probably do without it. If you are a business user, you may not have a choice. Many companies have used the Java language to develop business applications that run on servers, and this \"server-side\" Java is safe. It's the \"client-side\" Java running via web browser plug-ins that is not safe.</p><p>Note that Java has nothing to do with JavaScript, which is another language used to develop websites and apps. JavaScript was originally developed by a different company (Netscape) under a different name (LiveScript). The name was changed for marketing reasons that disgraced both the companies involved, neither of which survived.</p><p>Java has been in the news this year because of some \"zero day\" vulnerabilities exploited by malware writers. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack\">Zero day</a> means there is no patch for the hole, so users cannot protect themselves by updating their software.) This also happened last August, and The Register published a story saying <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/27/disable_java_to_block_exploit/\">Disable Java NOW, users told, as 0-day exploit hits web</a>.</p><p>In fact, Java became the main vehicle for malware attacks in the third quarter of 2010, when they increased 14-fold, according to Microsoft's Security Intelligence Report Volume 10 <a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/0/5/605BE103-9429-4493-898B-E3D50AB68236/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_volume_10_July-Dec2010_English.pdf\">(PDF)</a>. Things got worse, and Kaspersky, a leading anti-virus company, dubbed 2012 <a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software\">The year of Java vulnerabilities</a>. It said: \"Java security holes were responsible for 50% of attacks. Windows components and Internet Explorer were only exploited in 3% of incidents.\" Yes, it's that bad.</p><p>I therefore regard Java as an unnecessary security risk, and I removed it from our home PCs years ago. There were a few things I could no longer run, such as KeepVid for downloading YouTube videos and some ASDL speed tests, so I had to find alternatives. I suggest you do the same. Living without Java is much less of a challenge than living without Adobe Flash.</p><p>All programs have bugs and may have security holes, so why the Draconian approach? Sorry to say, I don't have enough confidence in Oracle's ability to fix it. Oracle didn't write Java, just inherited it when it bought the failing Sun Microsystems, and according to <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/30/oracle_java_security_analysis/\">The Register</a>: \"<a href=\"http://www.metasploit.com/\">Metasploit</a> founder HD Moore warned Oracle was still sitting on a backlog of Java flaws that will take up to two years to patch, even without the discovery of new flaws.\"</p><p>Oracle is good at selling high-priced products to large enterprises, but Java involves dealing with up to a billion non-paying consumers. In my view, Oracle's <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/oracle_speaks_up_on_java\">belated response</a> to the recent \"veritable media firestorm\" does not make the right noises about protecting consumers. It seems more concerned with defending its profit-making server-side and embedded Java businesses.</p><p>So, start by disabling Java in all your browsers. In Internet Explorer 8, for example, select Tools and then Manage Add-ons, and in Google Chrome, type chrome://plugins in the address bar. Sophos's <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/how-to-disable-java-chrome/\">Naked Security</a> blog has instructions for most popular browsers.</p><p>I also recommend uninstalling any other versions of Java that you can find via the Windows Control Panel. You may find three or four: in my experience, old versions of Java are not always removed. After that, run the free <a href=\"http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner\">CCleaner</a> program to clear out any bits left behind. (If you don't have CCleaner, download it from piriform.com, not some scam site or a Google ad.)</p><p>Next, go to the <a href=\"http://java.com\">java.com</a> website and click the link that says \"Do I have Java?\" The answer should be no.</p><h2>Re-installing Java</h2><p>If you know you must have Java installed, you can now do a clean installation of the latest version, either Java 6 to Update 39, or Java 7 Update 13. Java 6 is on the way out and won't be updated again. Some companies have stuck with it, possibly because of Java 7's terrible security reputation, but it has most of the same vulnerabilities. Mac users must update to the Java 7 Update 13 for Mac OS X.</p><p>If you are not sure you need Java, try running your PC for a few weeks to see if you can do without it. You will get a notification from any website that needs a Java browser plug-in. However, you must install it from java.com, because <a href=\"http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-poses-as-an-update-for-java-0-day-fix/\">some malware pretends to be Java update 11</a>.</p><p>Only install Java in a single web browser, and use this browser only for Java sites. For example, if you normally browse the web with IE or Chrome, install the Java plug-in in Firefox or Opera, or vice versa. Java is being attacked, and restricting it to one browser minimises the \"attack surface\".</p><p>Also, whenever you install or update Java, do it carefully. Oracle may try to install other software that you definitely do not want, such as the Ask toolbar. ZDNet's Ed Bott and Harvard Business School's Ben Edelman have analysed the problem in <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/a-close-look-at-how-oracle-installs-deceptive-software-with-java-updates-7000010038/\">A close look at how Oracle installs deceptive software with Java updates</a>. Don't get caught.</p><h2>Java on Macs</h2><p>Java is a cross-platform system, so the same vulnerabilities may be present on other operating systems besides Windows. Apple users have also suffered. In 2010, for example, there was a <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/10/koobface-worm-targets-java-on-mac-os-x/\">Mac OS X version of the Koobface worm</a>. Last year's Mac Flashback Trojan led to more than <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/04/05/mac-botnets-gaining-traction-using-drive-by-java-exploit/\">600,000 infected Macs being added to a botnet</a>, including 274 in Apple's home town, Cupertino.</p><p>Apple stopped including Java by default in OS X 10.7 (Lion), and has just used its XProtect software to block current versions of Java until they were patched. In effect, it treated Java as malware. This protected customers, but not everyone was pleased. After MacWorld UK reported the story (<a href=\"http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/news/?newsid=3424028\">Apple bans Java from Macs, businesses that rely on Java bereft</a>), editor Karen Haslam quipped on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarenhMW/status/297389313451237376\">Twitter</a>: \"Unfortunately we're one of the businesses affected... perhaps Apple doesn't want us to go to press!\"</p><p>InfoWorld magazine complained that <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/systems-management/apples-java-sabotage-bad-it-business-212193\">Apple's Java sabotage is bad IT business</a>. Since Apple is a consumer electronics company, I don't expect it's too bothered about corporate IT.</p><h2>Extra precautions</h2><p>I think everybody should be free to run whatever operating system and applications they like. However, you should be aware that running Java in the browser brings extra risk, and therefore you should take extra precautions.</p><p>(1) Always run the latest version of Java and make sure you install all the patches. At the moment, this may mean checking for updates every week, or even every day. You can do this with Secunia's <a href=\"http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/\">Personal Software Inspector</a>. (I wouldn't trust Java's built-in updater.)</p><p>(2) Run extra checks for malware using a different anti-virus product from the one you already have installed, especially if it's MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials). Two good free standalone checkers are <a href=\"http://www.malwarebytes.org/\">Malwarebytes AntiMalware</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.co.uk/security-scan\">Kaspersky Security Scan</a>.</p><p>(3) Make daily backups, and keep a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2011/jan/20/cloning-a-windows-hard-drive\">clone of your hard drive</a>. PCs are cheap but data may be irreplaceable.</p>","headline":"Java: should you remove it?","trailText":"<p><strong>Ask Jack:</strong> Following what Oracle called \"a veritable media firestorm\" about dangerous vulnerabilities in its Java software, Richard wonders if he should uninstall it.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/10/1326190162267/Java-script-code-003.jpg","wordcount":"1144","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-02-15T11:56:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/feb/08/java-remove-ask-jack-technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2013/feb/08/java-remove-ask-jack-technology","tags":[{"id":"technology/askjack","webTitle":"Ask Jack","type":"blog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"technology/apple","webTitle":"Apple","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/apple","references":[]},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/computing","references":[]},{"id":"technology/malware","webTitle":"Malware","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/malware","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/malware","references":[]},{"id":"technology/viruses","webTitle":"Viruses","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/viruses","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/viruses","references":[]},{"id":"technology/windows","webTitle":"Windows","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/windows","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet","references":[]},{"id":"technology/internet-explorer","webTitle":"Internet Explorer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet-explorer","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/internet-explorer","references":[]},{"id":"technology/firefox","webTitle":"Firefox","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/firefox","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/firefox","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-403730467","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/1/14/1358150745448/Java-logo-008.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Public Domain","altText":"Java logo","height":"276","credit":"Public Domain","caption":"Oracle described \"a veritable media firestorm\" about dangerous vulnerabilities in its Java software.

I have text to speech on my HP Pavilion laptop but (a) I am unable to slow it down enough for textbook type information as opposed to detective stories etc, and (b) it isn't practical to walk around behind a lawnmower carrying a laptop.</em><br /><strong>Bill Farman</strong><br /></p><p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is easy to do at a simple level, and Texas Instruments started making speech synthesis chips – as used in its Speak &amp; Spell toy – in the late 1970s. TTS then became common in computers during the next decade, starting with the Atari 1400XL home micro in 1983. (The Texas Instruments TI-99/4A did it before then, but only with its optional plug-in speech synthesiser module.)</p><p>As you appreciate, TTS is also part of Microsoft Windows, where it is currently used by Narrator to provide screen-reading facilities for people with impaired vision. In Microsoft Office 2010 and 2013, Speak is built into Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote. There are also lots of separate programs that either use Microsoft's SAPI (speech application programming interface) and Speech Platform software or bring their own TTS system.</p><p>If you have Microsoft Office, try the open source Microsoft Word add-in <a href=\"http://www.daisy.org/project/save-as-daisy-microsoft\">Save as DAISY</a>, which works with Word 2003, 2007 and 2010. This lets you select \"Save as DAISY\" from the Word menu and then \"Full DAISY\". This will save your RTF (Rich Text Format) or other document as an XML ebook and a synchronised MP3 audio file created using Microsoft's TTS software and the LAME encoding engine.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.daisy.org/\">DAISY</a> is the world standard for digital talking books, the name being derived from Digital Accessible Information System. It was developed in Sweden in the early 1990s and adopted by America's National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It makes audio files much easier to navigate.</p><p>There's a range of programs to handle DAISY files including DaisyWorm for the Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, and Go Read for Android.<br />Otherwise, you can play back the MP3 file using any MP3 player.<br /><a href=\"http://www.wordtalk.org.uk/Home/\">WordTalk</a> is another plug-in for Microsoft Word, and it's available free from Call Scotland at the University of Edinburgh. It allows you to change the voice and the speed of the speech, and save it as a WAV or MP3 file. It works with versions of Microsoft Word from Word 97 to 2010 but you must <a href=\"http://www.wordtalk.org.uk/Download/\">download the correct version</a>.</p><p>There are dozens of TTS programs for Windows, ranging in price from free to $100 or so, and some are listed in <a href=\"http://elearningindustry.com/subjects/tools/item/420-19-free-text-to-speech-tools-educators-tts-teachers\">19 free text to speech tools for educators</a> and <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/125305/the-best-text-to-speech-tts-software-programs-and-online-tools/\">The best text to speech (TTS) software programs and online tools</a>.</p><p>I can't say which is best, but <a href=\"http://www.cross-plus-a.com/balabolka.htm\">Balabolka</a> is worth a try. It supports a wide range of sources including RTF, PDF and many ebook formats, and offers a wide range of outputs including WAV, MP3, MP4, Ogg and WMA. There are the usual sliders to change the speed and pitch (fast/slow buttons are too crude to be useful). It supports both SAPI4 and SAPI5, so it works with a wide range of voices, both free and commercial. Balabolka is free.</p><p>Free alternatives include <a href=\"http://www.spesoft.com/free-text-to-mp3-converter.aspx\">Spesoft text to MP3 speaker</a>, and Zabaware's <a href=\"http://www.zabaware.com/reader/\">Ultra Hal TTS Reader</a>, which saves files in the WAV format.</p><p>Some paid-for solutions offer more features and/or produce better results. There's a free trial version of <a href=\"http://www.nextup.com/TextAloud/index.html\">Text Aloud 3</a> – which can also integrate with Microsoft Word – so you could download that and see if it's worth $29.95 to you.<br />There are also several websites where you can upload a file for processing and then download a converted version. I tried a few using Robert Frost's poem Fire and Ice, and <a href=\"http://soundgecko.com/\">SoundGecko</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yakitome.com/tts/index\">Yakitome</a> produced the best results. (I used <a href=\"http://www2.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php\">AT&amp;T's Natural Voices</a> as a reference point (<a href=\"http://192.20.225.36/tts/speech/ab3ad41387ea97e52671ea8dfde684b5.wav\">WAV</a>).</p><p>SoundGecko uses Windows Azure as its cloud platform so I thought I knew what to expect. However, it actually uses <a href=\"http://neospeech.com/default.aspx\">Neospeech</a> – which I hadn't heard of before – and the results were surprisingly good. I found it much better than <a href=\"http://www.naturalreaders.com/index.php\">Natural Reader</a>. I even preferred it to Edinburgh's <a href=\"http://www.cereproc.com/products/voices\">CereProc</a> which is famous for offering custom voices. (It did one for film critic Roger Ebert, and you can listen to its fake <a href=\"http://www.cereproc.com/files/bho_ad.wav\">Barack Obama</a>.)</p><p>SoundGecko has apps for leading mobiles – Apple, Android, Windows Phone – and can sync files to Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft SkyDrive. It's much simpler to create an MP3 from an RTF text file by using \"Save as\" from Word, but SoundGecko may appeal if you like the voicing and/or you're listening on a phone. The major catch would be if you needed any of the pro features, which cost $2.95 per month.</p><p>One final suggestion: most modern e-readers have a text-to-speech feature, so you could upload your RTF files to an Amazon Kindle (but not the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/26/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-review\">Paperwhite</a>) to listen to your files.</p><p>At the beginning, I said text-to-speech was \"easy to do at a simple level\". The problem is that it's very hard to do well. We have come a long way from flat robotic voices, but still don't have synthetic human voices that provide the right pronunciation, intonation and cadence over a wide range of topics. You just have to find the one you like best.</p><p>Most Windows users manage with the standard voice supplied with the operating system. This was Microsoft Sam in Windows XP and Microsoft Anna in Vista and Windows 7. There are three new ones in Windows 8 – Microsoft Hazel (UK female), David (US male) and Zira (US female) – and they are significantly better, as illustrated in this short <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-cfj3kkmOM\">YouTube video</a>.</p><p>In general, you need a big database and lots of processing power to get the very best results. This is why the TTS systems found in mobile phones are generally awful compared with PCs and Macs, whereas dedicated server-based systems such as Neospeech can produce even better results. It really depends on your taste, and how fussy you are. Our most famous TTS user, Professor Stephen Hawking, seems to manage just fine with his robotic voice.</p>","headline":"How to convert text documents into MP3 audio files","trailText":"<p>Bill Farman wants to convert his RTF text documents into MP3 files so he can listen to them while mowing the lawn.

But he could also think about different ways to share photos","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>I used to send and receive zipped pictures by email without problems using Windows XP. When I switched to Vista, however, the first time I wanted to unzip something, the computer produced a list of installed programmes and asked which one I wanted to unzip the file. As I did not have the faintest idea, I ticked the first one on the list, which happened to be Adobe Reader 9. As a result, I received then and ever after, a message saying Adobe 9 cannot open the file. I've tried countless ways to change this without success. I have been told that Vista has \"associated\" zip files with Adobe Reader and I cannot find any way to effect dis-association. Help! If I escape, what programs would open zip files in future?</em><br /><strong>Michael David</strong><br /></p><p>Files were originally zipped and unzipped using PKZip, a program written by the late Phil Katz (PK) in 1989. This file format became popular and it was \"given freely into the public domain\", so lots of other companies used it. In 1998, Microsoft built zip file support into Windows to offer \"compressed folders\", which would enable users to store more files on their hard drives. This was useful without being powerful enough to stop users who wanted a more sophisticated zip program from buying an alternative, which might lead to further anti-trust lawsuits.</p><p>With millions of programs using hundreds of file formats, some Windows XP users started to use the properties sheet for file associations. You can see this in XP by opening Windows Explorer, clicking Tools, selecting Folder Options, then going to the tab marked File Types. This lets you change a file association to a different program, should you so wish. The catch was that, because the zip function was built into Windows, there was no separate program for zip files. You hadn't installed a zip program in Vista so, I presume, you couldn't find an entry to use.</p><p>In Vista and Windows 7, the properties sheet has been replaced by a Control Panel utility: select Default Programs and choose the option that says \"Associate a file type or protocol with a program\". Alternatively, you can right-click on a zip file (or other file), select Properties, go to the General tab, and click the Change button to change.</p><p>The list of file associations is stored in the Windows registry, and since Windows depends on it, it's generally not a good idea to change it unless you know what you are doing. However, it is possible to change the registry by using simple text files that have a .reg file extension. There are lots of these files on the web.</p><p>Winhelponline.com has two useful pages devoted to reg files that anyone can download. There are separate pages covering <a href=\"http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html\">File association fixes for Windows Vista</a> and <a href=\"http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/file-asso-fixes-for-windows-7/\">File Association Fixes for Windows 7</a>. The Vista page includes fixes for 39 different file types, including avi, gif, html, mpeg, vbs and zip. </p><p>All you have to do is download and save zipfix_vista.reg, right-click on the file and select Merge, then restart your PC. (You will need to be an administrator, or Vista will not allow you to change the registry.)</p><p>Alternatively, Windows Annoyances has a page: <a href=\"http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article03-202\"><br />How do I turn off Compressed Folders (built-in support for ZIP files) in Windows Vista and XP?</a> This has files for turning Vista's zip support on (vistazip.reg) and off (vistaunzip.reg). Probably more people turn it off than turn it on.</p><p>In the end, however, you will probably be better off installing a separate program. Most of these can handle a wide range of different file compression formats, including RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, ACE, TAR, GZip, UUE and ISO, and will offer to set up the file associations for you. Corel's WinZip has historically been popular on Windows, but there are many free options including <a href=\" http://www.peazip.org/ \">PeaZip</a>, <a href=\"http://www.7-zip.org/\">7-Zip</a> and <a href=\"http://www.izarc.org/\">IZArc</a>. I'm not sure there is much to choose between them for most purposes, and personally, I prefer <a href=\"http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm\">WinRAR</a>.</p><p>You should also appreciate that there is not much point in zipping individual jpg images, because these are already highly compressed in a \"lossy\" format. The main benefit is that you can drop a number of images into a zip file or (in Windows) a \"compressed folder\" then send them all together as a single file. This is usually quicker and more reliable than adding numerous image files to one email.</p><p>Against that, image files are now a lot bigger than they used to be, and it's not unusual for cameras to produce jpg images that are 4MB to 6MB each. A bundle of images can become too large for some mail services, and will add to the strain on company mailboxes. Users are therefore finding other ways to share photos, including Facebook, Flickr, Photobucket and similar services. If you use the Windows Live suite, which replaced Outlook Express in Vista and Windows 7, then you can easily use Microsoft's free 25GB <a href=\"http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-upload-share-pictures\">SkyDrive</a> to share files and photos. SkyDrive lets you create folders and specify whether they are available to \"Everyone (public)\", \"My network\", \"Just me\" or \"Select people\". You can send links to pictures via email, and SkyDrive also works with Windows Phone 7 mobiles. It makes a lot more sense than emailing large files.</p><p>Another alternative is to use one of the file upload sites such as YouSendIt, RapidShare, FileFactory, MegaUpload and so on. There seem to be dozens. In the past, I've used <a href=\"http://www.multiupload.com/\">MultiUpload</a>. You upload your large file to this single site, and the recipient can download it from half a dozen sites (RapidShare, MegaUpload, Depositfiles etc), so they can pick the one they like. This is useful now that some UK internet service providers, including BT, filter traffic to some file download sites, rendering them more or less unusable. </p><p>If you are uploading files to one of these public repositories, you should use your zip program's password protection feature to keep the contents private.
