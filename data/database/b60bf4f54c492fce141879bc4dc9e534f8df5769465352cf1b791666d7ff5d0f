But it originally referred to a person's \"home territory\", the country or region where they lived. For Griffiths, our children have been cooped up indoors, imprisoned in front of their screens (whether television or computer), and they have lost all contact with their kith – with the woods and the wilds, the mountains and moors, the rivers and streams.

This confidence that all will end well leads democratic states to be complacent, allowing problems to fester, safe in the knowledge that, when it really counts, they'll solve them. Those problems eventually come to a head in the form of a grave crisis. But confronted with such a crisis, democracies usually do adapt just enough to survive. Confidence returns, which eventually turns into complacency and so it begins again. This is the confidence trap.

I've seen this alchemy at work on countless visits to schools, visits which have convinced me that poetry's narrative, rhythm and vibrant imagery is the real language of childhood. But poetry written for children is in danger of dying out, of sliding into fossilised irrelevance, cut off from modern verse. A classic such as Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses may be lovely, but it can't sustain the vital connection between children and poetry. Children also need poets who are still breathing.</p><p>The delicate machine which brings poetry books into the hands of children is in desperate need of repair. I used to help choose the poems for the <a href=\"http://www.childrenspoetrybookshelf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Children's Poetry Bookshelf</a>, the Poetry Book Society's book club for ages seven to 11, and I watched with horror as the submissions from publishers gradually dried up. Starved of funding and support, the club had to stop taking on new members in 2011. <a href=\"http://www.poetrybooks.co.uk/projects/41\" title=\"\">As PBS director Chris Holifield said</a>, it seemed that \"children's poetry in book form was close to extinction, with just a small number of new titles being published and not much backlist being kept in print.\"</p><p></p><p>No one doubts that a market for children's poetry exists. Children relish it, parents appreciate its accessibility and infinite re-readability, and teachers who've unlocked its potential in the classroom swear by it. In 2011, children's fiction and poetry editor Kate Paice summed up the dilemma of publishers <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/lbf-more-support-needed-childrens-poetry.html\" title=\"\">when she told the Bookseller</a>: \"A lot of bookshops seem quite scared of poetry. They don't know how to shelve it or how to sell it, and if we can't reach our market through bookshops then we can't sell to our market.\"</p><p></p><p>The fight back began in 2008, when an alliance of publishers, booksellers, educationalists and poetry organisations founded the <a href=\"http://www.poetrybooks.co.uk/projects/6/\" title=\"\">Children's Poetry Summit</a>. Now the writing school at Manchester Metropolitan University and Carol Ann Duffy's Manchester children's book festival have created an <a href=\"http://www.mmu.ac.uk/news/news-items/2212/\" title=\"\">international children's poetry prize worth £2,000</a>. Philip Gross and Imtiaz Dharker have joined me on a judging panel, sifting through more than 2,500 poems to create an illustrated anthology for readers aged five to 12, to be launched during the festival at the end of June. All we need now is booksellers brave enough to stock it.</p>","headline":"Why are booksellers afraid of children's poetry?","trailText":"<strong>Mandy Coe: </strong>Teachers, parents and poets alike know how children thirst for poetry.

Dyer explores our thirst for stories of hope in the face of disaster, from the real life tragedy of flight MH370 to literary fiction and the dramas of Hollywood","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The story of the disappearance of flight MH370, falling from the sky into the sea, is the opposite of the one that held the world's attention in 2010: the survival and reappearance, from the depths of the earth, of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/23/trapped-miners-alive-chile\" title=\"\">trapped Chilean miners</a>. While it has been established beyond doubt that the plane crashed into the ocean, with no survivors, the families of the dead understandably refuse to accept this conclusion. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, people are pulled from the wreckage of a collapsed building after the search and rescue efforts have given way to the grim duty of recovery. The loss a vessel with all hands, a mass death from which no one escapes, is not inconceivable, but the idea of such a thing being incommunicable is so dreadful that we cling to the hope of a survivor long after it is plausible. Hence the power and reassurance of the lines from Job quoted by Herman Melville in the epilogue to <em>Moby-Dick</em>. \"And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\" The black box embodies this idea of the survivor's story and testimony even in a situation where the loss of life has been total. Face to face with his fate, one of the last things Robert Redford's unnamed sailor does in the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155232/all-is-lost\" title=\"\"><em>All Is Lost</em></a> is to write a brief message, put it in a bottle and throw it overboard. All may be lost – but the hope is that this hand-scrawled version of the black box, will be found. If it is not … We have seen in the last few weeks the speed with which theories and conspiracies whoosh into the information vacuum. In the absence of reliable facts we are left with the lines repeated hypnotically by Conrad at the end of <em>The Secret Agent</em>: \"An impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang forever over this act of madness or despair.\" In a post-post-religious age the inexplicable has retreated, like some endangered animal, to the wild and dangerous places of the imagination. The flipside of this is an increasing hunger for such sightings, a thirst for stories of inexplicable survival.</p><p>An extreme example occurred shortly before MH370 went missing, when the Mexican fisherman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/12/homecoming-for-pacific-castaway-jos-salvador-alvarenga\" title=\"\">José Salvador Alvarenga</a> was found after drifting at sea for 13 months. Amazement that he had survived for so long on a diet of raw turtles and rain water soon turned to suspicion. This is hardly surprising given a history of fictional tales passing themselves off as fact – or of fact being turned into fiction – so lengthy that it reaches back to the dawn of the English novel. The real-life castaway Alexander Selkirk was the basis for Robinson Crusoe, whose adventures, the first edition claimed, were \"written by himself\", not by Daniel Defoe. Meticulously itemised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/williamgolding\" title=\"\">William Golding</a> in the novel <em>Pincher Martin</em>, the survival of the eponymous hero on a bare rock in the ocean is revealed, in the last lines, to have been not only a fiction – we knew that from the outset – but a parable. Even the fiction turns out to have been a fiction. Paradoxically, the more strictly stories of survival are stripped to their practical essentials the more readily they accumulate larger resonances. In his struggle to stay afloat Redford is like Sisyphus who, Camus insisted, we must imagine \"happy\". At one point, as one bit of ill-fortune is followed by another, Redford seems about to scream \"Fuck\". It never becomes a word, just a long howl of anguish: \"Fffwwuuuh…\" Apart from this moment, he is in his element. This is what he came to sea for. And it would be wrong, as we hear those fateful words, \"All is lost\", to take this as an admission of regret. It would be just as accurate to say that he has achieved his destination.</p><p>Compared with <em>All Is Lost</em>, <em>Cast Away</em> with Tom Hanks is a lavishly stranded epic. The aircraft in which Hanks and his colleagues are flying crashes into the sea, forced far from its presumed course by a storm. The search is called off, there are no survivors. But Hanks has survived, washed up on an island where he lives for four emaciated and bearded years on crabs, coconut milk and rain water. Various items from the plane float to the shore and prove useful – a pair of ice-skates is essential for sorting out his dental problems. But the best discovery, perhaps because it has no use value, is a Wilson volleyball. Hanks paints eyes and a mouth on it. Over the years, as it decays, it sprouts a tuft of hair and there develops, between man and ball, one of the great relationships in the history of cinema. In one scene, Hanks throws the ball away; afterwards there's a lovely post-row make-up with him on charming best behaviour – \"I know you, I know you!\" – as Wilson's usual silence acquires an impossible suggestion of hurt and sulk. This, of course, is not a relationship between equals. Wilson is not just Hanks's companion: he is also an altar and a god. A god created by the castaway's need. Eventually, after the two of them have left the island on a cobbled-together raft, Wilson is washed away. Hanks swims after him, reaches out his hand only to watch him drift from sight on what may or may not be Matthew Arnold's \"sea of faith\". Hanks, at that point, is so physically and psychically shattered as to be beyond hope and faith.</p><p>For most of <em>All Is Lost</em> the focus is so tight as to avoid the undertow of symbolic, religious or allegorical meaning – and is, as a result, unusually vulnerable to them. (Hamlet didn't call it a sea of troubles for nothing.) Redford is constantly trying to mend his boat. Unable to repair it he concentrates on slowing the rate of its deterioration. Even when he has only the brightness of his teeth to see by he's still trying something. That howl – \"Fffwwuuuh …\" – is the nearest he comes to prayer, after which he resumes the doomed chores of patching, pumping, fixing, plotting.</p><p>Shortly after seeing <em>All Is Lost</em> I saw the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/movies/charlie-victor-romeo-depicts-doomed-flights.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">film adaptation of the stage play <em>Charlie Victor Romeo</em></a>. Set in the cramped confines of the flight decks of aircraft as various real-life emergencies unfold, the dialogue – both between the crew and between crew and air traffic control – is derived entirely from transcripts from cockpit voice recorders. Some of the incidents end with the plane landing safely, others with the deaths of everyone onboard. During a Q&amp;A after the screening a member of the audience expressed surprise that there were no prayers, no mention of religion or god. The reason, it was explained, is that there's no time. In emergencies, as we have heard repeatedly in the last few weeks, pilots abide by the priorities of the abbreviation ANC: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. According to Tom Wolfe, test pilots such as Chuck Yeager who possess \"the right stuff\" are distinguished by the ability to think quickly and logically in suddenly catastrophic situations: \"I've tried A – I've tried B – I've tried C.\" The Chilean miners did a lot of praying, partly because they had so much time on their hands.</p><p>Which brings us back to where we began, to the hopes and prayers of families who had loved ones aboard MH370 and – spoiler alert – to the end of <em>All Is Lost</em>. Is the hand following a beam of light through the ocean and reaching down, Michelangelo-like, to the drowning Redford, an implausible cop-out or a religious salvation? Since these are, in a way, synonyms, it is both.</p><p>It is also strangely reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dhlawrence\" title=\"\">DH Lawrence</a>'s great long poem \"The Ship of Death\". Few people can have lived their lives with such a consciousness of death as Lawrence – though this often manifested itself as a wilful refusal to attribute his ill-health to the tuberculosis that would kill him. Even when he was forced to go to a sanatorium, the aptly-named Ad Astra, Lawrence grumbled, in one of his last letters, \"this place no good\". It's as though, having exhausted all other options, he&nbsp;could at least express chronic dissatisfaction with this world. But in the posthumously published poem he confronted his death directly, through the image of a boat sailing slowly into deeper and deeper darkness until it is completely enveloped by it:</p><blockquote><p>And everything is gone, the body is gone <br />completely under, gone,<br />entirely gone. <br />The upper darkness is heavy as the lower,<br />between them the little ship<br />is gone <br />she is gone.<br />It is the end, it is oblivion.</p></blockquote><p>Few pieces of writing bring the reader this close to the incommunicable experience of death, of nonexistence. The end is as uncompromising and absolute as the verdict that flight MH370 went into the water, that there are no survivors. But the poem is not at an end. It continues:</p><blockquote><p>And yet out of eternity a thread <br />separates itself on the blackness, <br />a horizontal thread<br />that fumes a little with pallor upon the dark. <br />Is it illusion? or does the pallor fume <br />A little higher? <br />Ah wait, wait, for there's the dawn, <br />the cruel dawn of coming back to life<br />out of oblivion.</p></blockquote><p>• Geoff Dyer's new book, <em>Another Great Day at Sea</em>, about life aboard an American aircraft carrier, will be&nbsp;published in May.</p>","headline":"Flight MH370 and the solace of survivors'

Turner on a&nbsp;sexually free, Lord of the&nbsp;Flies-like education at a school where the children made the rules","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>AS Neill, the headmaster and founder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/aug/19/summerhill-school-at-90\" title=\"\">Summerhill</a>, the \"free\" school in Suffolk where lessons are voluntary and children invent their own laws, is&nbsp;described in <em>A Conversation about Happiness</em> as \"a kindly grandfather figure … from another century\". However, the composite portrait of him in Mikey Cuddihy's ambivalent account of her 1960s childhood at Summerhill is not particularly flattering. The towering, corduroy-clad Scot was then in his 80s: \"With ears as big as a baby elephant's and hairs sprouting all over the place, his big veiny nose and his wrinkled, turkey neck, Neill is the only old man I know. The pipe, the accent, his huge feet in shiny lace-ups: he might as well be an alien from another planet.\" An anti-authoritarian and advocate of sexual freedom, Neill insisted staff and pupils swam naked in the school's outdoor pool: \"There is something ugly, wasted and obscene about Neill's red genitalia, flapping about,\" she writes.</p><p>Cuddihy was raised in New York and orphaned at the age of nine when her mother, a sometime alcoholic, was killed in a car crash (she may or may not have been drunk at the time). Her&nbsp;father had died the same way four&nbsp;years earlier. He was a scion of a wealthy Irish-Catholic family, the son of a publishing magnate and cousin of&nbsp;the Fords and Vanderbilts. Mikey and her siblings went to live with his brother, a former investment banker, who, after a messy divorce, had returned to university to study psychology. It was he who decided to send them, in the summer of 1962, to board at Summerhill. Neill's \"self-constructed, child-centred universe\" in Suffolk was, according to its creator, \"possibly the happiest school in the world\". The exiled Cuddihys seldom saw their American family, who they presumed were engaged in a vicious custody battle over them, and were encouraged to think of Neill as a foster parent.</p><p>Neill founded Summerhill in 1921 with only a handful of pupils. An analysand and devotee of the radical psychoanalyst and sexologist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron\" title=\"\">Wilhelm Reich</a>, he hoped to raise children there free of sexual repression, which he believed was the destructive force in society. \"We set out to make a school in which we would allow children freedom to be themselves,\" Neill wrote. \"In order to do this we had to renounce all discipline, all direction, all suggestion, all moral training, all religious instruction.\" His book, <em>Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing</em>, captured the mood of the counterculture and sold 2m copies in America during the 60s (the following decade, a German translation sold more than 1m). Though the publisher excised all references to&nbsp;Reich, who was considered too controversial a figure for an American audience, the book followed Reich's lessons on freedom and love. \"Sex with&nbsp;love is the greatest pleasure in the world,\" Neill wrote, \"and it is repressed because it is the greatest pleasure.\"</p><p>As a consequence of Neill's late-found fame in the States, American pupils at Summerhill outnumbered English kids by two to one. Most were from California, and arrived with suntans and white-blond hair. Cuddihy was greeted by an existing student with the question: \"Do you know how to play fuck-chase?\" The large Victorian building had been an army HQ during the war and the boarders slept in old army bunks, almost as if they were evacuees; dilapidated Nissen huts in the grounds served as makeshift classrooms. The youngest students, referred to as Tinies, were only four or five, \"all permanently shod in wellingtons with trousers tucked in, and ragged jumpers, snotty and frayed at the cuffs, and anoraks that they wear indoors as well as out\". During the weekly meetings, in which the entire school met to ratify rules and distribute fines and other punishments, they clung to the teachers \"like love-starved apes\".</p><p>Tourists flocked to Summerhill in busloads to view the 60 students in all their feral glory. \"Smiling couples stroll the grounds, arm in arm, as if they are visiting Monet's Garden at Giverny,\" Cuddihy writes. \"They find the school surprisingly drab. We are not the flower children they were expecting to find. We are scruffy little tykes, running around the place, climbing trees, swearing and wrestling each other to the ground.\" Cuddihy's grandmother, having sailed over from Park Avenue on the QE2, came to visit in a Rolls-Royce with liveried chauffeur, wearing&nbsp;a mink coat and doused in Chanel No 5. There were occasional celebrity visitors. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/24/usa.popandrock\" title=\"\">Joan Baez</a> arrived, after an argument with her boyfriend Bob Dylan, and taught Cuddihy some&nbsp;chords on the guitar. (With the proceeds of a London concert, she helped build Summerhill's outdoor pool.) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/leonard-cohen\" title=\"\">Leonard Cohen</a> also visited, before sending his stepson to the school.</p><p>In protest at being exhibits in some prelapsarian zoo, the kids voted to ban visitors from their Saturday meetings. Neill, who was keen to show off Summerhill's democratic workings, stormed out in anger. Cuddihy writes that this was \"the first and only time\" she saw him blow his fuse. On other occasions the pupils exercised their right to scrap all laws and a period of riotous anarchy would ensue. Cuddihy describes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/feb/18/redesigning-lord-of-the-flies\" title=\"\"><em>Lord of the Flies</em></a>-like scenario in which a group of boys decided to start a dictatorship in an attempt to restore order. There was then a revolution to depose them, followed in turn by a fascist coup. It was a visceral lesson in politics. They enjoyed \"freedom but not licence\", Neill reminded them of the responsibilities of self-government, and \"could do anything as long as it didn't bother anyone else\".</p><p>Neill, who regretted having used the&nbsp;lash in his early years teaching in Scotland, was the kind of man who would join a student in throwing stones at a greenhouse so as to undermine the subversive gesture. He was not, however, the most patient of teachers: \"Ach away with ye lassie; I've nae time fare the likes of you, you're wasting your time, and mine,\" he said, throwing Cuddihy out of his maths class. \"Go and find something more interesting to occupy yerself with!\" He&nbsp;also gave \"private lessons\", during which he practised wild psychoanalysis on students; in Cuddihy's case these sessions focused on her Catholicism and his suspicions of her feelings of guilt about sex. She felt her peers were \"too like siblings to contemplate romance\". It&nbsp;was common for students to get married in mock weddings, and they were allowed to sleep together. Neill's wife would take older girls to Harley Street to be fitted with Dutch caps.</p><p>More worryingly, sexual relations between students and teachers were also common. Neill's 16-year-old daughter Zoë, who has run the school since 1985, was a contemporary of Cuddihy's and is described walking around \"arm in arm\" with her boyfriend, the French teacher. Neill's 35-year-old stepson Myles, who taught pottery in \"the best-equipped classroom in the school\", had a bedroom opposite the girls' dormitory where female students liked to listen to records and&nbsp;smoke. According to Cuddihy, he went&nbsp;out with some of the more senior pupils. \"Myles can get away with it, he has a special dispensation,\" Cuddihy writes. Another teacher was forced to&nbsp;leave after drunkenly groping some older girls. Summerhill was and remains essentially a family business. Because of the isolation and poor pay, she notes, \"the young, sparky teachers never stay\".</p><p>Cuddihy's evocative memoir is written with a deliberate naivety, similar to that of the child narrator in Esther Freud's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/fiction.books.estherfreud\" title=\"\"><em>Hideous Kinky</em></a>, but it seems odd that the tone doesn't seem to change significantly in the last third of her book, which describes what happened to her after she left Summerhill. Like many former students, she was drawn to the&nbsp;creative professions, and is now an artist and lecturer at the University of Brighton. (She also went on an unsuccessful date with Gordon Brown.) Having swallowed Neill's rhetoric of a&nbsp;happy childhood, later revelations make her question how his philosophy played out in practice, and her uncle's real reasons for sending her there. \"You'll be entering a world where people are repressed, emotionally crippled, and taught to hate,\" Neill warned school leavers. \"Tread carefully.\"</p><p>• Christopher Turner's book about Wilhelm Reich, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007507740\" title=\"\"><em>Adventures in the Orgasmatron</em></a>, is out from Fourth Estate.</p>","headline":"A Conversation About Happiness, review – a childhood at Summerhill","trailText":"<p><strong>Christopher Turner </strong>on a&nbsp;sexually free, Lord of the&nbsp;Flies-like education at a school where the children made the rules</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395673270444/Summerhill-school-004.jpg","wordcount":"1341","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T11:55:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/28/conversation-happiness-summerhill-school-review-mikey-cuddihy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/28/conversation-happiness-summerhill-school-review-mikey-cuddihy","tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/schools","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/schools","references":[]},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/education","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/education/education","references":[]},{"id":"profile/christopher-turner","webTitle":"Christopher Turner","r2ContributorId":"50237","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopher-turner","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/christopher-turner","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433205081","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395673265161/Summerhill-school-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Ed Thompson","altText":"Summerhill school","height":"54","credit":"Ed Thompson","caption":"Neill’s ‘self-constructed, child-centred universe’ … Summerhill.

And when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/bbc-arts-release.html\" title=\"\">the big announcement</a> came this week, in director general Tony Hall's presentation detailing \"the biggest arts push for a generation\", literary initiatives were indeed mentioned, but&nbsp;on inspection they don't amount to&nbsp;much that's new.</p><p>Noticeably they're largely short-lived projects, annuals not perennials: there's no sign of a topical books show or books documentary series. Dead writers will have to await their anniversaries to be feted (next up: a Dylan Thomas season), while the only hope for living ones who are not global celebrities lies in the multi-arts programmes, <em>Imagine</em>, <em>The Culture Show</em> and, until it was scrapped this week, Wark's <em>The Review Show</em>. Although the BBC is to replace Sky as the Hay festival's broadcast partner – focusing on authors, but tellingly in their second lives as performers.</p><p>Hall returned to the BBC after 12 years running the Royal Opera House and the performing arts are the big winners in his plans. (which can be seen as giving them at least equal status with, and potentially dethroning, the visual arts, long dominant in BBC priorities). His most eye-catching literary announcements involved treats on stages: more <em>Hollow Crown</em> Shakespeare history plays following those in 2012, Gemma Arterton (below) in a candlelit <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em>.</p><p>\"BBC to offer more books coverage\", the Bookseller dutifully enthused, but beyond the 10-day wonder of Hay it's hard to see what qualifies as \"more\" about books and writing, as opposed to play-scripts and acting: Radio 2, 3 and 4 will continue their existing coverage; <em>Imagine</em> will be profiling a novelist – Philip Roth – as it already regularly does; and Melvyn Bragg will once more be extolling favourite writers.</p><p>Nor is the promise of a remake of the 1969 landmark series <em>Civilisation</em> automatically a reason for bookworms to rejoice, since Kenneth Clark's grand tour was as notorious for privileging art and architecture in its definition of civilisation – hence only a few writers were squeezed in, mostly Renaissance geniuses and Romantics – as it was for Eurocentricity. If one of the BBC's plethora of art lovers is chosen as&nbsp;the new Clark, literature is liable to be marginalised again.</p><p>Hall's plans appear to leave BBC books-related output much as it is: flourishing if poorly coordinated on radio, but the Cinderella of the art-forms on television, suspected of being irremediably unsexy and so without a dedicated programme (unlike film or pop music), or documentary series of such frequency that they often overlap (unlike the visual arts), or a festival lasting eight weeks (unlike classical music). Try to name a BBC television books presenter who is on screen as often as, say, Andrew Graham-Dixon or Alastair Sooke, and you get an idea of the problem.</p>","headline":"Hopes for greater books

Twenty-one years later she finally dies, confronting the remaining three with their own roles in her drawn-out death.</p><p>Such, more or less, is the premise of&nbsp;Yiyun Li's new novel. It's a simple enough story, and one that lends itself naturally to the familiar double time-frame structure of countless mysteries in which present lives are rocked by the reverberations of a crime buried deep in their shared past. Depending on the author's sensibility, the structure can be a way of building pure suspense, or of revealing unexpected psychological depths in the cast of characters. Li, pictured, who has been justly showered with awards for her previous three books, seems to be aiming for both. In theory that ought to qualify the book for the much-prized category of literary thriller, but I'm not sure it quite fulfils either aspect of that hybrid genre.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the present lives of the three survivors, which occupy a large chunk of the book, are required by the plot to be punitively bleak and sterile – the spiritual equivalent of the victim's physical poisoning – and as a result make for some pretty dull reading. Two of the three survivors have moved to the US. The third has stayed on in Beijing, caring for Shaoai, the victim. The depictions of the two emigres, especially, offer little reward for the effort of following them through their green-card marriages and sad divorces, their studiedly boring jobs and growing isolation. Yes, their lives are true to a certain Middle-American blandness of tone and texture, but in itself that's not enough to make them interesting.</p><p>Partly, also, there's something problematic in the prose itself. Li's past work has shown that she is capable of writing powerfully, but in much of this book she indulges a habit of moralising authorial commentary that clogs the flow of individual scenes, and casts an aura of ponderous solemnity over the action. It's not that the comments aren't illuminating; they sometimes are, but they are often so complicatedly expressed that by the time you've deciphered them, you've also disengaged from the moment they were supposed to illuminate. Here's one that trapped me for an eternity in its looping coils: \"But there was no point apologising: a man unable to extricate himself from the mercy of others has to find some balance in those who put their lives at his mercy.\" Others, for all their intricate articulation, struck me as plain banal: \"She was not armored against that danger as she might have thought; no, she was not protected at all: only those who do not seek answers are safe from being touched.\" It's an odd effect: Henry James meets Confucius.</p><p>About halfway through – dangerously late, though not fatally – things pick up. By now, the three survivors have begun to emerge from their blurrily similar lives into distinct individuals with distinctly different claims on our sympathy: sweet-natured Moran with her possibly culpable innocence; Ruyu, a study in deliberate icy-heartedness, fully worthy of her own self-appraisal as a \"lonely, vicious, remorseless orphan\" and yet not unsympathetic; Boyang, doomed to an ineffectual decency … The story, circling slowly backwards, has finally come close enough to its originating crime for the reader to understand the forces binding these characters (until now, they've seemed to inhabit three barely connected novels). Meanwhile, the crime itself has begun to accumulate resonances that turn it into something more than just the hook for a gruesome thriller.</p><p>Shaoai, it transpires, was a political rebel; an ardent supporter of the Tiananmen protest movement, who before her poisoning had already sacrificed her own future for the sake of that brutally suppressed revolt. Bitter at the cowardly silence of her fellow school-students in the aftermath of the massacre, she taunts and goads them mercilessly. Consequently her murder, though not on the face of it a political act, compels a political reading. In her, the hopes of a more open China are slowly and agonisingly extinguished. The allegory is given elegiac force by periodic speculations on the ghostly alternate histories that run alongside history itself. \"In a parallel world Shaoai would have made a brilliant career for herself,\" Moran reflects. \"The best life is the life unlived,\" Boyang concludes, \"and Shaoai would be the only one to have a claim to that truth.\"</p><p>It works well as fable, and there's enough complexity in Shaoai's character for it to work well as fiction, too. Far from portraying her as a saint, Li&nbsp;makes her a difficult, unlikable teenager, with a gift for spreading misery, and a distinctly predatory sexuality. The scenes between her and&nbsp;Ruyu – who arrives as an orphan to share her home and bed, and in whom she meets her match in terms of iron will and unyielding self-possession – have a chilly incandescence. In their austere power, you see what Li is capable of as a writer.

The Turkish government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\" title=\"\">restricted access to the micro-blogging website</a>, and prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  indicated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/turkey-erdogan-facebook-youtube-ban-elections\" title=\"\">the ban could be extended further</a>, saying he would not \"leave this nation at the mercy of YouTube and Facebook\" and pledging to \"take the necessary steps in the strongest way\".</p><p>On Thursday, he appeared to follow up that threat as Turkish media reported that the country's telecommunications authority (TİB) had blocked YouTube as a \"precautionary administrative measure\". The latest curbs came hours after an audio recording of a high-level security meeting was leaked on the video-sharing website. Turkey previously banned YouTube in 2007, but lifted the ban three years later.</p><p>According to PEN, the Twitter ban currently remains in place despite an administrative court order on 26 March ordering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban\" title=\"\">its suspension pending a court judgment</a>.</p><p>Pamuk, who won the Nobel in 2006, not long after Turkish state prosecutors had charged him with \"insulting Turkishness\" for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/12/nobelprize.awardsandprizes\" title=\"\">remarks he made to an interviewer</a>, told the Guardian \"there were times in Turkey when free speech was equally bad … as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/turkey.youtube\" title=\"\">in 2008 when YouTube was closed</a>. But at that time we were at least hopeful about the future. Not now. The situation here is going from bad to worse, and even towards terrible.\"</p><p>Pamuk's translator Maureen Freely, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/maureen-freely-pen-friendship\" title=\"\">new president of English PEN</a>, added: \"The real worry, I think, is that Erdoğan now seems to have the power to do whatever he wishes, whenever he wishes. And that is why we're so concerned about what he'll do next, to silence dissenters and crush opposition wherever he sees it.\"</p><p>The signatories to the letter point to the fact that Turkey ranks 154th&nbsp;among 180 countries on the <a href=\"https://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php\" title=\"\">World Press Freedom Index</a>, saying that even today, \"translators, editors, publishers, poets and writers face criminal proceedings and even imprisonment for legitimate expression under a variety of legislative fetters\". <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org/turkey-focus-2013-muharrem-erbey\" title=\"\">PEN particularly highlighted the case of Muharrem Erbey</a>, a human rights lawyer and writer who was arrested in 2009, and who is currently in prison awaiting trial. PEN believes the charges against the author are politically motivated, and that Erbey is being held because of his alleged affiliation with Kurdish political parties. The free speech organisation is calling for his immediate release.</p><p>In their letter, the writers – from Turkey and around the world – are asking Turkey's leaders \"not to retreat from democracy and its keystone, freedom of speech; but rather to recognise their obligations under international treaties and to lift the block on Twitter with immediate effect\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433193842'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2011/2/17/1297959958419/Cif-Elif-Shafak-007.jpg' alt='Cif: Elif Shafak' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'Democracy in Turkey is sorely lacking' … Turkish writer Elif Shafak was tried for 'insulting Turkishness'</figcaption></figure><p>\"We urge them to remember that this beautiful country will be stronger and happier when, and if, it appreciates pluralism, diversity and the freedom of words,\" they write. \"We welcome the administrative court in Ankara's decision to suspend the [Twitter] ban ahead of a full judgment and urge the telecommunications authority to restore access to Twitter immediately.\"</p><p>The Turkish author Elif Shafak, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/21/turkey.world\" title=\"\">who was also tried for \"insulting Turkishness\"</a> following the publication of her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/29/fiction.features1\" title=\"\">The Bastard of Istanbul</a>, is one of the authors to sign the letter. \"Turkey's rulers need to understand that democracy is not solely about getting a majority of votes in the ballot box. Far beyond that, democracy is a culture of inclusiveness, openness, human rights and freedom of speech, for each and every one, regardless of whichever party they might have voted for. It is the realisation of the very core of democracy that has been sorely lacking in Turkey today,\" said Shafak, whose trial – based on words uttered by fictional characters in her novel – went on for a year before charges were dropped.</p><p>The letter comes in the wake of a <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/turkey-end-human-rights-violations-against-writers-and-journalists\" title=\"\">new report from PEN International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org\" title=\"\">English PEN</a> on the Gezi Park protests last year, and their impact on freedom of expression. \"The excessive use of police force, as well as widespread media censorship and reprisals against journalists and users of social media, starkly illustrated the shortcomings of Turkish democracy in its lack of pluralism and disregard for fundamental rights and freedoms,\" says the report. It also lists the \"human rights violations\" that took place during the protests and calls on the Turkish government to, among other things, ensure freedom of expression is respected  and peaceful protestors are not \"arbitrarily detained\". PEN International and English PEN also wants the right to peaceful assembly included in Turkey's proposed new constitution.</p>","headline":"Turkey and Twitter: major authors join PEN International

Not only did he condemn many people, perhaps hundreds, to cruel and ignominious deaths, he also clandestinely manipulated some of the&nbsp;leading figures in western security services for decades, charming out of them all manner of the most sensitive information and passing it on to the KGB. As more than one of his dupes ruefully observed, he fooled them all.</p><p>Yet what kind of power is it that the double agent enjoys? Of the people Philby moved among – wives, lovers, children, friends, fond colleagues – not&nbsp;a single one was taken into his confidence. He hugged his secret to him and, one presumes, fed his ego on&nbsp;it. That is a kind of power, certainly. \"Philby enjoyed deception,\" Macintyre writes. \"Like secrecy, the erotic charge of infidelity can be hard to renounce. Some men like to parade their knowledge. Others revel in the possession of&nbsp;information that they decline to share, and the private sense of superiority that this brings.\"</p><p>Even his Russian handler, the suave and sophisticated Yuri Modin, who ran the Cambridge spy network, found Philby to be an enigma. Modin wrote of him: \"He never revealed his true self. Neither the British, nor the women he lived with, nor ourselves [the KGB] ever managed to pierce the armour of mystery that&nbsp;clad him … in the end I suspect that Philby made a mockery of everyone, particularly ourselves.\"</p><p>This is surely right, but only to a point. Philby would have hotly denied the charge of mockery. In an interview with the journalist Phillip Knightley in Moscow in 1988, he was adamant: \"I don't like deceiving people, especially friends, and contrary to what others think, I feel very badly about it.\" Bad he may have felt, but he never faltered. After his defection to Moscow he was joined by his third wife, Eleanor, who one day asked him what was more important in his life, her and their children, or the Communist party. \"The party, of&nbsp;course,\" he answered. One reads this exchange with a shiver, yet with a certain admiration, too. How many of us would have the steel to give ourselves over so unwaveringly to a cause?</p><p>In all the books, articles and memoirs in which Philby has figured it is striking how little attention, indeed, how much credence, is given to his belief in&nbsp;the communist revolution. The&nbsp;question is asked over and over: how could he do it? How could he deceive his family, friends and colleagues? How could he betray so many agents in the field, to&nbsp;be shot at border posts or sent into the Lubyanka to face torture and execution? The answer, at one level, is&nbsp;simple. He had&nbsp;a faith, and he never lost it.</p><p>For those whom he deceived, Philby had to be made into a grandmaster of duplicity, a great and terrible genius; if&nbsp;he were anything less, they would seem even more careless, gullible and plain stupid than they were. The fact is, however, Philby was a perfectly ordinary product of his time and milieu, except for one thing, the ferocity of his commitment to a cause. \"What Philby's enemies described as betrayal,\" Macintyre writes, \"he saw as&nbsp;loyalty.\" For all his clubbability, for all the drinks parties he gave and the cricket matches he attended, Philby was a fanatic, and fanaticism is something that we in the secular and more or less democratic west find almost impossible to understand.</p><p>Simply put, we have forgotten what it is to be seized by the force of an idea. <a href=\"http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/index.html\" title=\"\">Isaiah Berlin</a>, contemplating the \"ideological storms\" that swept through the 20th century, cautioned that \"it is as well to realise that these great movements began with ideas in people's heads: ideas about what relations between men have been, are, might be, and should be; and to realise how they came to be transformed in the name of a vision of some supreme goal in the minds of the leaders, above all of the prophets with armies at their backs.\"</p><p>For all that we might marvel at Philby's unwavering loyalty to the party, it is easy to sympathise with the&nbsp;wounded bafflement of the people who were closest to him professionally, or who thought themselves closest to&nbsp;him, such as his MI6 colleague Nicholas Elliott and the CIA chief James Jesus Angleton, both of whom he took in, chewed on, and spat out with not a moment's hesitation or, for all his protestations, real remorse.</p><p>Philby's friend and fellow spy, the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a>, famously remarked that \"in the lost childhood of&nbsp;Judas Christ was betrayed\". In the case of Philby, commentators reach back into his earliest days in search of a&nbsp;solution to the conundrum that he represents. There are those who point to the love-hate relations between him and his doughty father, the Arabist St John Philby, as the source of a violent drive towards duplicity and betrayal. It&nbsp;seems a dubious proposition.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432323108'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395079407738/kim-philby-002.jpg' alt='kim philby' width='140' height='215' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In this context it is useful to turn to <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849546997\" title=\"\"><strong>Kim Philby: The Unknown Story of the KGB's Master Spy</strong></a>, the late Tim Milne's finely written and refreshingly unhysterical book. He and&nbsp;Philby were pupils together at Westminster, where Milne's first and peculiarly apposite memory of his friend is of \"a very small boy happily trying to squash a bigger boy behind a&nbsp;cupboard door\". Milne, grandson of the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh, would later serve in MI6 – was there anyone in that circle who did not do his and sometimes even her stint as a spy? – and is sceptical of the Oedipal theory as an explanation of Philby's betrayals. St John Philby had been a popular success at Westminster, but \"Kim was uninterested in trying to emulate … these successes, nor did he give the impression of having turned his back on them because he knew he would fall short of his father's achievement: it was merely that he thought he had better things to do.\"</p><p>Philby travelled in Germany as a student – Milne gives fascinating and revealing accounts of his friend's behaviour and attitudes at this time – and later he worked as a journalist in Spain, where, thanks to his cover as a&nbsp;Nationalist sympathiser, he was decorated by Franco himself; it was one&nbsp;of the many ironies of Philby's extraordinary life that besides this signal honour he was also awarded medals by both Britain and the Soviet Union.</p><p>As with many young Englishmen of&nbsp;his generation, the spectacle of the Nazi takeover in Germany, and then of the atrocities of the Spanish civil war, drove him to communism. Unlike most of the others, however, he dedicated his life to the overthrow of capitalism. But did he truly believe in the cause? Milne writes, \"To become a communist is one thing; to remain a communist is&nbsp;quite another\" and goes on to quote Philby's own account of the Pascalian wager that he made: \"It cannot be so&nbsp;very surprising that I adopted a Communist viewpoint in the 1930s; so&nbsp;many of my contemporaries made the same choice. But many of those who made that choice in those days changed sides when some of the worst&nbsp;features of Stalinism became apparent. I stayed the course.\" With that mixture of candour and what Greene called Philby's \"chilling certainty\" there is no arguing.</p><p>Yet we must beware of being lulled into accepting Philby's own estimate of&nbsp;himself and his motives. Nothing in&nbsp;life is simple, and in Philby's life in particular every layer gave on to other, deeper layers. There is the fact that for all his leftwing convictions he was also a snob. \"In some ways,\" Macintyre shrewdly suggests, \"Philby's story is that of a man in pursuit of ever more exclusive clubs,\" and what could be more exclusive than a club that has only one member?</p><p>And then there is the performance itself, in which a move was never missed or a line fluffed. Nietzsche recognised that to be truly convincing to others a man must learn to impersonate himself; as one of his closest friends observed of Philby, \"he was the greatest actor in the world\". And at the&nbsp;start of each day's performance he&nbsp;must pray, along with Samuel Butler: \"Vouchsafe O Lord to keep us&nbsp;this day without being found out.\"</p><p>It might seem that by now Philby as a subject had been done to death, but as these two books amply illustrate, he&nbsp;is still a source of fascination and&nbsp;wonderment. Macintyre writes with&nbsp;the diligence and insight of a journalist, and the panache of a born storyteller, concentrating on Philby's friendship with and betrayal of Elliott and of Angleton, his pathetically dedicated admirer at the top of the CIA. Macintyre's account of the verbal duel between Elliott and Philby in their final confrontation in Beirut in 1963 is&nbsp;worthy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnlecarre\" title=\"\">John le Carré</a> at his best – and indeed, Le Carré contributes an afterword, which is as eloquent in what it does not say as in what it does. Milne, for his part, treats his old friend&nbsp;and deceiver with surprising tenderness. \"I do not regret knowing him,\" he writes. \"He enriched my world for many years and I owed a lot&nbsp;to him.\" The Philby charm held good to the bitter end.</p><p>And speaking of ends, have we learned all there is to know about Philby the master spy? What exactly did Yuri Modin mean when he spoke of Philby having made \"a mockery of everyone, particularly ourselves\"? When it comes to spying, Jim Angleton used to say, we are in a hall of mirrors, in which everything is reflected doubly, triply, endlessly…</p><p>• John Banville's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781447236689\" title=\"\"><em>The Black-Eyed Blonde</em></a><em> </em>(written as Benjamin Black) is published by Mantle.

But Robert Aickman has never enjoyed a readership which extends beyond the cult. Now the literary publisher Faber &amp; Faber is hoping to change all that, as it prepares to mark the late author's centenary year by bringing a selection of his long out-of-print novels back on to shelves.</p><p></p><p>The press is planning reissues of Aickman's novels The Late Breakfasters and The Model, both of which have been out of print for decades, to mark the centenary of the author's birth in June. Faber will also release new editions of Aickman's story collections Cold Hand in Mine, Dark Entries, The Wine-Dark Sea and The Unsettled Dust, previously only available via print-on-demand, or as limited hardback editions. The books will feature new introductions from Reece Shearsmith and the author Richard T Kelly, and afterwords by friends of Aickman, including the horror novelist Ramsey Campbell.</p><p></p><p>According to the publisher, Aickman has been rated as \"an absolute master of the horror genre ... among the cognoscenti\" for many years. His fans include Neil Gaiman, who once compared reading Aickman to \"watching a magician work\" and often not even being \"sure what the trick was. All I know is that he did it beautifully.\" For Shearsmith, \"every story you read by Aickman has something lurking within it that will stay with you long after you have finished reading it.\"</p><p></p><p>Aickman himself called his tales \"strange stories\", a description which captures the feel of a haunting tale like The Fetch, in which the protagonist is pursued by a faceless wraith, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/oct/29/scary-stories-halloween-robert-aickman\" title=\"\">The Hospice</a>, in which a travelling businessman stays in a hotel for the night only to notice, while eating dinner, that \"a central rail ran the length of the long table a few inches above the floor. To this rail, one of the male guests was attached by a fetter round his left ankle.\"</p><p></p><p>Aickman will also be honoured at this year's World Fantasy Convention in Arlington, Virginia. \"He seems always to proceed from a rather grey-toned realism where detail accumulates without fuss, and the recognisable material world appears wholly four-square – until you realise that the narrative has been built as a cage, a kind of personal hell, and our protagonist is walking toward death as if in a dream,\" says Kelly in his introduction, adding that \"so elegantly and comprehensively does Aickman encompass all the traditional strengths and available complexities of the supernatural story that, at times, it's hard to see how any subsequent practitioner could stand anywhere but in his shadow\".</p>","headline":"Robert Aickman to be honoured with resurrection of horror classics","trailText":"Faber &amp; Faber to release reissues and new editions of cult author's books to mark his centenary year, writes <strong>Alison Flood</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937618675/Reece-Shearsmith-and-Neil-004.jpg","wordcount":"442","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-27T13:34:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/27/robert-aickman-resurrection-out-of-print-horror","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/27/robert-aickman-resurrection-out-of-print-horror","tags":[{"id":"books/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/horror","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/horror","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/neilgaiman","webTitle":"Neil Gaiman","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/neilgaiman","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/neilgaiman","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433151144","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937627222/Reece-Shearsmith-and-Neil-009.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","altText":"Reece Shearsmith and Neil Gaiman","height":"276","credit":"Getty Images","caption":"Paying tribute … Aickman's celebrity fans Reece Shearsmith and Neil Gaiman Photograph: Getty Images","width":"460"}}]},{"id":"gu-image-433151145","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395937618675/Reece-Shearsmith-and-Neil-004.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","altText":"Reece Shearsmith and Neil Gaiman","height":"84","credit":"Getty Images","caption":"Reece Shearsmith and Neil Gaiman Photograph: Getty Images","width":"140"}}]}]},{"webTitle":"What are the great sentences in genre fiction?","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-27T16:04:03Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","id":"books/booksblog/2014/mar/27/what-are-the-great-sentences-in-genre-fiction","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nqzn","standfirst":"What makes a world-class literary sentence, and can genre writers ever compete with stylists such as Jane Austen or James Joyce?","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>What makes a great literary sentence? I've been thinking about this in advance of a <a href=\"http://oxfordliteraryfestival.org/literature-events/2014/march-29/the-genre-fiction-debate\">debate I'm chairing</a> at the Oxford literary festival this weekend on whether there is any difference between literary and genre fiction. </p><p>Then, as if from the depths of my subconscious, up popped <a href=\"http://theamericanscholar.org/ten-best-sentences/#.UzPyvPbV3e5\">a blog from The American Scholar</a> listing their editorial team's 10 favourite sentences. (Well, 11, actually, as they threw in Truman Capote as a bonus.) </p><p>As befits a scholarly outfit, the authors listed were mostly high literary standards, ranging from Jane Austen and Dickens to  F Scott Fitzgerald and Toni Morrison. It was only in the comments section that the genre writers began to trickle in.</p><p>William Gibson's Neuromancer made an appearance with: \"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.\"  </p><p>Douglas Adams brought his inimitable humour to the show with  \"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't\" from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. <br /> <br />Both of these are science fiction, which is interesting, because when I conducted my own watercooler conversation on the Guardian books desk about great sentences from genre fiction, it was SF examples that poured forth.</p><p>Iain M Banks was nominated for \"An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.\" (That's from  Excession.)</p><p>M John Harrison, a genre stylist if ever there was one, was also mentioned. Reviewing Harrison's novel Light back in 2002, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/02/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.iainbanks\">Iain Banks picked out two gems</a>: \"She had the impatience of a 14-year-old - that life had not allowed her to remain 14, she could sometimes imply, was her special tragedy\", and \"Suddenly he understood this as a condition of things... there it would be, a boiling, inexplicable, vertiginous similarity in all the processes of the world, roaring silently away from you in ever-shifting repetitions, always the same, never the same thing twice.\"</p><p>From spy fiction, John le Carre could not have realised how prophetic the following sentence would come to seem 40 years after publication of  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/17/reading-group-tinker-tailor-le-carre\">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</a>: \"The more identities a man has, the more they express the person they conceal.\"  </p><p>But, as with so many of the great lines from crime and thrillers, this has an aphoristic brilliance. Where, in genre fiction,  is the luminescence of James Joyce's \"I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race\" (from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/24/james-joyce-portrait-of-the-artist-john-crace-digested-classics\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>)?</p><p>Or the existential brilliance of Samuel Beckett's  \"The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\"  (from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/jun/04/samuel-beckett-manuscript-murphy-in-pictures\">Murphy</a>)?</p><p>Is there anything to match these in genre writing?

A fine-art graduate, she brings the same high-concept sensibility and visual flair to her second book, which follow two Antarctic expeditions set a century apart.</p><p>In both time schemes, three people are chosen from among their fellow explorers to land on a tiny island – a&nbsp;lump of rock named Everland in honour of John Evelyn, the man bankrolling the 1912 expedition. The&nbsp;scientists of 2012 know all about the disastrous first voyage: it's been immortalised by the captain's diaries and a classic film they regularly show on movie nights in the comfortably temperature-controlled Antarctic base. They know about the callousness of Napps, leader of the three, who with Millet-Bass, an uncomplicated ox of a man, abandoned poor Dinners when supplies were running low and bad weather made rescue look impossible. When the rest of the crew eventually managed to land on Everland, they found a frostbitten Dinners on the point of death sheltering under an upturned boat: it was obvious to all what must have happened.</p><p>No one has set foot on Everland since, but Decker, Jess and Brix are as eager in 2012 to sign up for a field trip as Napps, Millet-Bass and Dinners were a century before. Decker, the leader, is an old hand on his final trip; Jess is the terrifyingly efficient field assistant; Brix is enthusiastic but untested. They'll be tagging seals and penguins, but the purpose of the trip is mostly symbolic: that's why there are only three of them pitted against the icy wilderness. After all, that went so swimmingly before …</p><p>As the two expeditions unfold in tandem, each trio dependent on their fellows for survival in one of the most hostile places on earth, parallels quickly become clear. Three is, as Brix notes, a remarkably \"divisive\" number, and there is a dreamer in each group who really shouldn't be there. The strong resent the weak; the weak hate themselves; and the leaders wonder what they would do, if pushed, to survive. Hunt's descriptions of the logistics of Antarctic voyages in the different eras are fascinating: the first&nbsp;trip so brutally dangerous, it is vanishingly unlikely that a living body can survive it. Death saturates the whole endeavour, not least for the ponies and dogs, who \"started as an engine and ended as fuel\". Eyes change colour; hair becomes patched with white; every sailor is irrevocably altered in mind and body.</p><p>For Decker, Jess and Brix, backup is a mere couple of hours away and their supplies consist of hi-tech ready meals and painkiller gel rather than kidney soup and tobacco; but once on Everland, they are not much less vulnerable than the men who were there before them. The Antarctic climate suspends both healing and decay; a pat of butter will retain the knife marks of a previous century, and the tiniest cut stays open for months. Time, in this sense, hardly passes, so it makes perfect sense that the explorers should find themselves speaking each other's words. Echoes between the two&nbsp;missions resound throughout the&nbsp;book, as though they are calling to&nbsp;each other across the decades. Men a&nbsp;hundred years apart describe the Antarctic experience as one intensifying moment: \"an endless single day&nbsp;growing darker by the hour\" and&nbsp;an \"endless single day\", \"getting whiter\". A patch of orange lichen both teams remark on has spread just one millimetre in a century; a frozen body waits, eternally preserved. It is a place outside time – but one that can kill you in minutes.</p><p>Set against such endless indifference, human lives barely register; yet the characters insist throughout that \"every day has a consequence\". The meaning and worth of life, and the manner of leaving it, become intensely&nbsp;important on the knife edge of survival; the historical version of the&nbsp;1912 expedition, with its heroes and villains, is overturned by the tense unfolding of what really happened.</p><p>Hunt's first book didn't quite fulfil the promise of its audacious conceit, but her second is nothing short of stunning: an adventure story, a psychological investigation of physical&nbsp;and mental breakdown, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;remarkable account of weather and endeavour. Her stylishly unshowy prose lays Antarctica out before us,&nbsp;from looming giant bergs and shimmering light effects to dirty ice and sodden sand, the epic desolation and the sudden riots of wildlife. Her descriptions of the landscape, as well as of the intense cold and its effects on&nbsp;the body – intestines feeling like \"a&nbsp;frosted coil of rope\", the compulsion to keep swallowing to avoid one's throat glazing over – are remarkably vivid, but the structural patterning of&nbsp;the book also adds a metaphysical aspect. Those heroic Edwardian adventurers, so remote in space and time, come into heartbreakingly clear focus: Millet-Bass, out on the ice in the&nbsp;dark, wondering why \"he'd had this idea that he could afford to say everything of importance at some other distant point\". Hunt's measured&nbsp;restraint, her dry humour and idiosyncratic eye have created something very powerful and unusual&nbsp;indeed.</p>","headline":"Everland by Rebecca Hunt review – a stunning Antarctic adventure","trailText":"Explorers vie with the weather and themselves in Hunt's vivid and stylish tale, says <strong>Justine Jordan</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395674396921/antarctica-003.jpg","wordcount":"850","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T23:05:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/27/everland-rebecca-hunt-antarctica-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/27/everland-rebecca-hunt-antarctica-review","tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"profile/justinejordan","webTitle":"Justine Jordan","rcsId":"GNL366450","r2ContributorId":"15933","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Justine Jordan is the Guardian's deputy literary editor</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/justinejordan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/justinejordan","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/antarctica","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432863780","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395674393472/antarctica-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Nick Garbutt/Barcroft Media","altText":"antarctica","height":"54","credit":"Nick Garbutt/Barcroft Media","caption":"'A place outside time – but one that can kill you in minutes.'

If he continues to spend his time in New Mexico, he could easily complete the book by year's end and start the final editing and promotional process for a fall release.\")</p><p>But at Martin's publisher, HarperCollins, his publisher Jane Johnson tells me this morning that there's no date lined up \"until George delivers, and I have no idea when that will be.

Is there anyone of reading age who hasn't heard of Shakespeare? It's hard to imagine. Is there anyone, in fact, who wouldn't recognise this sentiment: \"Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an Englishman's constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct.\"</p><p></p><p>The prose is 200 years old (it's Crawford, speaking in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten\" title=\"\">Jane Austen</a>'s Mansfield Park), but the sentiment – references to Englishmen aside – could have come from last week. While I'm quoting Jane Austen, the response to Crawford's remark is just as interesting:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree ... from one's earliest years. His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk Shakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To know him in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly is, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>I won't pretend to be able to read Shakespeare well aloud. In fact, here's my confession. If you asked me, I'd probably say I know Shakespeare \"pretty thoroughly\", but the truth is that I haven't paid much attention to him for longer than I'd care to admit. I read a lot in my teens, a bit in my 20s, and hardly any in the last few years.</p><p></p><p>I'm guessing there must be plenty of other people out there in a similar position. So this 450th anniversary seems like a great excuse to get reacquainted with the great man. The only question is where to start. I know where to stop. Generally when inviting nominations for the Reading group, I suggest we could also look at writers and novels directly influenced by the main subject. But since, in Shakespeare's case, that means just about everything written in English after his death, let's not go there. Instead, let's focus only on the Bard himself. There are 38 (according to most people) plays to choose from, a whole bunch of sonnets, and a few narrative poems. Some of them are so good that they still seem like miracles, more than 400 years after they first arrived. All nominations will be gratefully received – and since we're sticking to one author, why don't we have a vote? Over to you.</p><p></p><p></p>","headline":"Choose April's Reading group: William Shakespeare","trailText":"He is the world's best-known writer – and perhaps one of its least read.

Take Käthe Kollwitz's etching <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/kathe-kollwitz-self-portrait-hand-at-the-forehead-selbstbildnis-mit-der-hand-an-der-stirn-1910-published-c-19461948\" title=\"\"><em>Self-portrait with Hand to her Forehead</em></a>, reproduced in James Hall's new book. The head and hand fill the entire plate, leaving no room for anything else. The heavy, repeated lines form dark shadows on and around the head, while the eye under the hand is obliterated by darkness. Yet&nbsp;her face presses forward, as if she were leaning on the kitchen table, offering us, with inescapable intimacy, a memory of the suffering and sadness she witnessed in the poor quarter of Berlin where her husband worked as a doctor. The viewer need know nothing of this: it is all there in her look.</p><p>Whatever stance they promote, be it pompous or playful or merely pleasing, self-portraits have much to say. They can show success or indulge in self-mockery; advertise a new aesthetic or celebrate a marriage. \"Certainly he likes his face; what is wrong with that?\" writes Gowing of the self-portraitist (again confining his thoughts to his own gender). \"Naturally he is not without vanity, without a little conceit few men could&nbsp;bear their mirrors of their lives. Moreover, the painter's opinion of himself is a part of his equipment. He&nbsp;needs his conceit, as an opera singer does. Pride and a certain exultation nourish any physical skill.\" Again, the accuracy of this is borne out by illustrations in Hall's book; most memorably so by <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw00371/James-Barry-Dominique-Lefevre-James-Paine-the-Younger\">James Barry's cool sideways glance</a>, or by the fresh and <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw05282/Sir-Joshua-Reynolds?LinkID=mp03755&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=0\" title=\"\">original pose adopted by the youthful Reynolds</a> as he shades his eyes with his raised arm. But there is much else going on in <em>The Self-Portrait: A Cultural History</em>, as&nbsp;it departs radically from the popular belief that the sole purpose of self-portraits is to bring us into contact with the artist's soul.</p><p>It's hard to understand why self-portraits, as a genre, have until now been so little discussed. They include some of the greatest works of all time. Among those featured in this book are <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-family-of-felipe-iv-or-las-meninas/\" title=\"\">Velázquez's <em>Las Meninas</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search.html?no_cache=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;tx_damzoom_pi1[showUid]=2364\" title=\"\">Courbet's <em>The Artist's Studio</em></a>, as well as such masterpieces as <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/listings/2012/rembrandt-at-work\" title=\"\">the 1665 self-portrait by Rembrandt at London's Kenwood House</a>, a painting seemingly devoid of any agenda other than what it feels like&nbsp;to carry into old age the weight of being human. Yet despite such riches, this genre has, until now, remained largely overlooked (<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5893547/A-Face-to-the-World-On-Self-Portraits-by-Laura-Cumming-review.html\" title=\"\">Laura Cumming's recent book</a>, <em>A Face to the World</em>, is an&nbsp;exception), existing merely as subset&nbsp;within portraiture, which is a relatively&nbsp;under-investigated subject. Perhaps the huge diversity within self-portraiture, and its leaning towards bombast, have kept scholars at bay. Be that as it may, Hall has now created a cultural map of this field, and he charts its development in&nbsp;terms that relate to the interests or intellectual climate of each period.</p><p>Nothing about this book is predictable. Hall, while acknowledging that portraiture was pioneered by the&nbsp;Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, argues&nbsp;that a coherent starting point for self‑portraiture is the middle ages, because it was an age preoccupied with&nbsp;personal salvation and self-scrutiny. One illustration, c943-57, shows a tiny St Dunstan prostrate before a giant figure of Christ, seeking absolution by touching his robe. It is&nbsp;one of the many surprises in this survey, for Hall's illustrations, though always&nbsp;deftly chosen in relation to his argument, are often little known. He presents the engraving by Israhel van Meckenem, <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/i/israhel_van_meckenem,_self-por.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Self-Portrait With His Wife</em></a>, c1490, which is indeed as Hall describes it – \"one of the most delightful and intense double portraits ever made\". The two heads are squeezed together, making a tight fit within the space. Every detail compels attention: the curls escaping from Israhel's cap, the tops of his wife's breasts, pushed above&nbsp;the neckline of her tight dress, or the way the outline of her bonnet gives a heart-shaped frame to her face. Nothing could better explain Hall's claim that, as the 16th century approached, artists began putting themselves more in the picture – physically, socially and stylistically – for portraiture had become more naturalistic and more concerned with&nbsp;the individual.</p><p>Hall makes knowing use of contingent details. He is an expert on the various kinds of mirrors which aided the development of self-portraiture. He inevitably focuses at one point on the circular convex mirror on the back wall of the National Gallery's <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jan-van-eyck-the-arnolfini-portrait\" title=\"\"><em>The Arnolfini Portrait</em></a> and agrees with others that Van Eyck is probably one of the three figures reflected in it. He notes also the inscription on the wall above the mirror, \"Jan van Eyck was here\", but&nbsp;does not engage with the debate as to whether or not a marriage is taking place; and, if it is, whether or not we can look on the picture as the equivalent to a marriage certificate. Elsewhere, however, Hall accesses vast tracts of knowledge with an easy familiarity, as he travels through the centuries and across Europe to the present day.</p><p>It appears that, up until 1490, the production of self-portraits remained modest and spasmodic. During the Renaissance, the genre benefitted from&nbsp;the \"heroisation\" of the artist, though in time this led on to its polar opposite, the mock-heroic self-portrait. The obvious example of this is the <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html/m/michelan/3sistina/lastjudg/4lastjud.html\" title=\"\">scrunched-up likeness of his own features which Michelangelo gave to&nbsp;the flayed skin</a>, held up by St&nbsp;Bartholomew in the <em>Last Judgment</em> on&nbsp;the end wall of the Sistine Chapel, an identification which many accept, although it was not put forward until&nbsp;1925. Hall, a specialist on Michelangelo,&nbsp;connects this flayed self‑portrait to Michelangelo's interest in the shedding of skins, be it his own, or the outer \"skin\" of a marble block which the sculptor removes, in order to reveal the life within. The flaying or shedding of a skin or two becomes an act of cleansing and therefore an \"imitation\" of Christ's Passion.There are many instances where Hall's arguments take us down unexpected routes. He also moves his survey on through his identification of historical shifts. At one moment he discusses the importance of self-portraitists found in their studios; then, in the 18th century, he observes them buffeted by contrary passions, while in the 19th century they are shown seeking a return home, to more rooted forms of expression. The pursuit of the elusive self, it seems, never ends.</p><p>No mention of the \"selfie\" is made in Hall's discussion of the modern and&nbsp;contemporary period, but he does note&nbsp;that self-portraits today flood the internet and that children at school are&nbsp;required to make them. Van Gogh remains a role model, with his fierce expressiveness. Hall is acute on the&nbsp;tense, short-lived partnership between&nbsp;Van Gogh and Gauguin in the&nbsp;four-room Yellow House at Arles. Van Gogh's decision to portray himself and&nbsp;Gauguin by means of two rush-seated chairs is well-known. But Hall enhances perception by pointing to the way both face inwards, as if towards each other, and therefore ape paired portraits from the Renaissance where each sitter turns slightly towards the other. Van Gogh also introduces the theme of the serial-self-portraitist that continues in the work of Frida Kahlo, Cindy Sherman, Gilbert and George and Antony Gormley, to name just a&nbsp;few, all of whom Hall deals with lightly&nbsp;but tellingly.</p><p>There is never a dull passage in this book: the detail is crisply imparted; the&nbsp;content richly arcane at times, but more usually profoundly human; the ideas come freshly coined. Hall manages to retain the intellectual high ground while writing with verve and enthusiasm. It is a creditable achievement, and, like all the best gifts, comes beautifully wrapped, in book production of the highest quality.</p>","headline":"The Self-Portrait: A Cultural History –

shines through a clanking plot in the Newsnight presenter's haunting story of love and memory","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Kirsty Wark, pictured, is a respected BBC presenter, fronting <em>Newsnight</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Review Show</em>. It's one thing to&nbsp;present, with great intelligence, programmes about the arts, and another to submit a first novel to the scrutiny of one's peers. Part romance, part family history, mother-and-daughter fable and meditation on memory, <em>The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle</em> has qualities of heart that balance its often gauche plot handling.</p><p>Nonagenarian Elizabeth Pringle, a&nbsp;lifelong resident of the island of Arran, bequeaths her house to a virtual stranger. Years back Elizabeth was captivated by the sight of a holiday visitor from mainland Scotland, Anna Morrison, passing with a baby in a pram: a long-haired, blithe, hippyish mother, and a singing child. Anna, on impulse, asked Elizabeth to tell her if she was ever thinking of selling her home. Decades pass. Elizabeth never forgets the mother and baby – for reasons revealed late in the story.</p><p>As the novel opens, we meet Anna's&nbsp;child as a grown woman, Martha Morrison. Her mother now has&nbsp;dementia. Martha, burdened and&nbsp;forlorn, is drawn to Arran as to a&nbsp;magnet. What she finds there is a &nbsp;\"feeling of knowing the ground beneath her\". Arran is bountiful in other, less credible, ways. It affords a&nbsp;Polish carer for Anna,&nbsp;long-lost kin and a lover.</p><p>The plot of <em>The Legacy of&nbsp;Elizabeth Pringle</em> tends to&nbsp;clank and grind. Its romance elements are&nbsp;cliched and the sex&nbsp;scenes truly excruciating. Pacing feels ponderous in the middle sections. While Elizabeth's first-person narrative, a memoir composed just before her death, is&nbsp;deftly handled, the&nbsp;alternating third-person account from Martha's perspective can seem prolix. But something of&nbsp;great worth and beauty gleams through the narrative and haunts the reader with its imaginative truth.</p><p>That centre is Elizabeth herself as&nbsp;she recapitulates her singular life. Not&nbsp;much, in truth, has happened. She&nbsp;nearly married. She taught – \"I&nbsp;was&nbsp;an exceptional teacher.\" Elizabeth lost a father at the end of&nbsp;the&nbsp;first world war, a lover in the second. She cherished her house, garden and friendships. She walked around Arran. And yet, in the deeper sense, everything has happened. Both ordinary and extraordinary, Elizabeth recollects and composes her own life. It's a portrait of a woman who lives with harrowing integrity.</p><p>In old age Elizabeth befriends two younger men, Niall and Saul, who both – rivalrously – mourn her passing. Her relationship with Saul, a Buddhist monk, is especially remarkable: \"We&nbsp;must have made an odd sight – companions separated by more than fifty years, an elderly spinster in a&nbsp;tweed skirt and stout shoes and a&nbsp;tall&nbsp;weather-beaten Buddhist in his&nbsp;colourful garments, on occasion carrying a tall shepherd's crook with a&nbsp;fluttering multi-coloured pennant.\" Wark's presentation of a unique love unalloyed by sexuality is original and enthralling. What is possible in old age? Everything, it seems, while memory serves.</p><p>The novel ripples with unease at the mortality of memory. \"Eventually,\" says Martha's mother, \"the dark will cover me.\" But what Anna cannot recall, Arran restores. Martha inherits in Saul a kind of messenger from the dead: \"It was you, wasn't it, in the pram?\" The erotic scenes with Niall are&nbsp;less persuasive than Anna's convergence with Elizabeth. Her \"heart hammered as it came to her that she and Elizabeth Pringle had existed in the same space ...&nbsp;Was Elizabeth somewhere deep in Martha's memory?\"</p><p><em>The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle</em> is a hymn to the stark beauty of the island of Arran. There may be new visitors looking for&nbsp;Elizabeth.</p><p>· Stevie Davies's <em>Awakening</em> is published by Parthian.</p>","headline":"The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle review – Kirsty Wark's first novel gleams with beauty","trailText":"Truth shines through the clanking plot in a haunting story of love and memory, says <strong>Stevie Davies</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395663469313/Kirsty-Wark-003.jpg","wordcount":"554","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T23:05:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/27/legacy-elizabeth-pringle-kirsty-wark-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/27/legacy-elizabeth-pringle-kirsty-wark-review","tags":[{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"media/kirsty-wark","webTitle":"Kirsty Wark","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/kirsty-wark","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/kirsty-wark","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stevie-davies","webTitle":"Stevie Davies","r2ContributorId":"48873","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevie-davies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/stevie-davies","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432845017","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395663464995/Kirsty-Wark-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Murdo MacLeod","altText":"Kirsty Wark","height":"54","credit":"Murdo MacLeod","caption":"Kirsty Wark … 'original and enthralling in her presentation of a unique love unalloyed by sexuality'.

But what of the worst mums in fiction?","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>A quick glance at the racks of Mother's Day cards would turn anyone off motherhood: of course we love our mothers, but really – would we truly express it like that? And is there a faint feeling that the more extreme, gushing cards might be chosen by those whose relationships with their mothers are not, in fact, perfect? So it might be refreshing to take a turn round some imperfect parents in fiction: here we go with the bad mothers' literary litany.</p><p>Mrs Bennet from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/pride-prejudice-200th-anniversary\" title=\"\">is always Exhibit A</a> – but her real crime seems to be that she embarrasses her sensitive children. Read it as a teenager and you wince for poor mortified Lizzie and Jane, thinking perhaps of times when our own mother said the wrong thing. The older reader – more robust, a parent – can think it is the positive duty and pleasure of a mother to embarrass her child from time to time, to stop them getting on their high horse. And, as apologists of Mrs B have pointed out, at least she is trying to do something about the family's woeful situation: she appreciates the poverty and misery that will face them all if marriages are not made. Perfect papa Mr B – so lovely, so witty at the expense of his family – appears not to give a toss about what will happen to his daughters.</p><p>Charles Dickens had an extremely difficult relationship with both of his parents – they were feckless, and he felt they let him down badly – and mothers do not come off well in the books. His picture of his own mother is Mrs Nickleby – mother to Nicholas and Kate – and is quite painful. She is incompetent, foolish, and no good in a sickroom – \"coming into the room with an elaborate caution, calculated to discompose the nerves of an invalid rather more than the entry of a horse-soldier at full gallop\" – very unhelpful given the amount of illness and nursing occurring in the oeuvre. Mrs Copperfield, horribly, fails to protect David from his stepfather, while Bleak House's Mrs Jellyby lets the children fall downstairs and get their heads stuck in railings because she is so busy with her charitable works.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/marilynne-robinson\" title=\"\">Marilynne Robinson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\" title=\"\">Housekeeping</a>, Lucille and Ruth's mother commits suicide, leaving them to face an uncertain future. In Nick Hornby's About a Boy, the mother attempts suicide in a situation where the boy Marcus will find her and – much worse – cuts his hair for him (\"fashion is stupid, baa, sheep\"), part of what stops him fitting in at school.</p><p>The mother in Arthur Ransome's children's classic, Swallows and Amazons, is something of a cipher, but her inability to make basic decisions does mean she receives one of the finest telegrams in all literature. Asked if the children may go on an adventurous sailing-and-camping expedition, the absent father replies, heartlessly: \"Better drowned than duffers if not duffers will not drown.\"</p><p>In children's books of that era (the Ransome was published in 1930), parents are nearly always absent or dead in order to clear the decks for adventure and excitement, and in some adult books the same easy path is taken. The over-productive romance writer Ruby M Ayres gave us a very bad mother in her 1924 book Ribbons and Lace. The heroine, who changes her name to Linda Lovelace (yes really) is left to fend for herself and her grandmother when her father dies, leaving them penniless – the mother wanders off in search of a better life, although she does turn up again when there is some prospect of Linda marrying money. She is rotten through and through, as you feel Ayres might have put it herself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433070146'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2011/8/24/1314179894456/Still-from-Channel-4s-The-007.jpg' alt='Still from Channel 4's The Illustrated Mum' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Compulsive viewing... The TV version of The Illustrated Mum. Photograph: Channel 4</figcaption></figure><p>In modern children's books, mothers are often just plain unsatisfactory. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/may/11/costabookaward.jacquelinewilson\" title=\"\">The Illustrated Mum</a> is one of Jacqueline Wilson's many examples (tattoos and bipolar disorder), while the parents of Roald Dahl's Matilda (the small person's Carrie) are splendidly grotesque. Mrs Wormwood chose \"looks not books\". Dahl knew what he was doing: to good middle-class parents, disapproving of reading is the worst mistreatment, worse than Barbie dolls and sweets.</p><p>There are spectacularly neglectful mothers in Philip Hensher's 2011 King of the Badgers, and in Dennis Lehane's thriller Gone Baby Gone (1998) – the Lehane ending on a decision concerning the mother that must have every reader (or viewer of the 2007 film) debating the rights and wrongs of the case. These are both very working-class women – but negligence crosses the boundaries. Lady Montdore in Love in a Cold Climate greets her only daughter after the death of her first child with \"So the poor little baby died, I expect it was just as well, children are such an awful expense\". The various mothers in Vita Sackville-West's The Edwardians (1930, looking back at pre-first world war days), are heartless and unable to understand their daughters, ready to marry them off to the highest bidder. One of the daughters in the book, in love with a penniless artist, is told by her mother's friend to marry the lord who is also on the scene and, with a hideous wink, \"we'll see what can be done about the painter afterwards.\"</p><p>Evelyn Waugh's Brenda Last (in the 1934 novel Handful of Dust) takes some kind of prize: her lover and her child are both called John, and when she is told \"John is dead\" she is relieved that it is the child. The main thought that this provokes is \"How much did Waugh hate his first wife to write this fictionalised version of her?\"</p><p>But perhaps the worst one of all is in The Manchurian Candidate – she is (<strong>spoiler</strong>) controlling her brainwashed son as an assassin on orders from the KGB.</p><p>At this point we sense that Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole is ready to insist that his mother Pauline should be added to the list – but I reject that totally. She is a Mother Courage for the age, spending the child benefit on gin and fags, endless boyfriends in tow, but always turning up for her children – she's a fictional mother for real mothers to relate to.</p><p>Mothers can't win – they are mean to their children, they fail to protect them from fathers, stepfathers and random new boyfriends, they are too protective, or not enough. Looking at the literature of mothers over the past 200 years, the striking thing is that the vast majority of it is written from the perspective of a child (albeit a grown-up one) and not a parent – scores to settle, grudges to chase, fair enough. It's only slowly, and in recent years, that the voice of the mother has come out – the odd middlebrow novel of the kind Virago and Persephone rescue (<a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/consequences.html\" title=\"\">EM Delafield</a> or <a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/someone-at-a-distance.html\" title=\"\">Dorothy Whipple</a>) and more recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/16/fiction.features\" title=\"\">Margaret Drabble</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/14/julie-myerson-lost-child-review\" title=\"\">Julie Myerson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/09/biography.features\" title=\"\">Rachel Cusk</a>.</p><p>But still, I'm betting there won't be much change in the proportion of bad mothers in novels. The ground is too fertile. Which are the fictional mothers you love to hate?</p>","headline":"Bad mothers in books: a literary litany","trailText":"<p>As Mother's Day looms, we are surrounded by saintly images of perfect matriarchs.

I'm approaching this, incidentally, as the hypothetical parent to whom the book is addressed, rather than the adolescent, whom it also seeks to engage; if I were an adolescent reading this, I would have set fire to it and hurled it into dry woodland, to express my rage and also&nbsp;to impress my friends.</p><p>Most immediately irksome, apart from the amateurish illustrations, are the paternalistic instructions in how this book should be read. \"You may want to experience the book in whatever approach is best for you after reading Part I … If you enjoy learning by blending concepts and facts with science and stories, reading the book from front to back might be best …\" What this means in practice is that the&nbsp;book does not progress from hypothesis, via evidence, to credible thesis, but rather, tosses out theses and half-theses and notions and fancies like a wise and kindly man feeding seed to birds.</p><p>Siegel considers at the outset why we should take seriously the proposition of supporting and nurturing adolescent changes, rather than fearing and rejecting them. \"With all the problems our world faces today … never before have we so desperately needed a way to think beyond our usual strategies to create innovative ways of sustainable living on our precious planet. My suggestion to you is that the power of the adolescent mind has just that spark of emotion and social drive, just that push to explore new solutions to old ways of doing things, that may save life&nbsp;on our planet.\"</p><p>I struggled somewhat with the meaning of this – is it that teenagers have solutions within them right now, the imagination and originality to avert&nbsp;the environmental apocalypse? Because if so, surely the last thing we should be doing is bending our own brains to make the effort to understand why they want to go to the shops with their friends when they already have all the eye shadow they need? Surely we should be putting them in some kind of hothouse where their ideas can&nbsp;really make a difference?</p><p>It's possible that he means something&nbsp;different – that adolescents treated with sensitivity now will retain enough of their optimism to become the adults that can solve our planetary problems. But this is also difficult to substantiate: why haven't the rest of&nbsp;us&nbsp;grown into these pro-social, intellectually ambitious adults? What grounds do we&nbsp;have to offload these burdens on to&nbsp;the next generation? I&nbsp;mean, I'm no sentimentalist, I'd certainly leave it to them if I thought they were up to it; but I see no reasonable grounds for believing that, however empathically we manage to&nbsp;treat them during their intensely flexible brain period.</p><p>But hey, it doesn't matter, apparently, because \"even if we don't buy into the idea that adolescents will save the world, at least understanding brain science may help explain how we can encourage a teen to decide to call home or come in by one in the morning instead of three.\"</p><p>If it's intended as bathos, this fails; the sombre mood created by the spectre of global scarcity isn't alleviated by the light-hearted, hackneyed kicker. Actually, I don't think Siegel does have that intention; I&nbsp;think these are all just seed, cast before us. \"You want to believe they'll save the world? They may! Or maybe you just want them to call once in a while? We can do that too!\"</p><p>And yet there is something else in his writing, some quality of patience and warmth. Sara, a patient (some names have been changed) was having&nbsp;trouble allowing her son his independence. \"To a certain extent, she had been relying on him as an attachment figure, as if he were a parent and she his young child. Of course this meant that his moving away for a year was absolutely terrifying. Sara needed to learn to soothe the 'younger Sara'…\" There is a&nbsp;gentleness and acceptance in his tone; it made me realise that there is more to this phenomenon (and the book has been extremely successful) than desperate parents who will read&nbsp;anything.</p><p>By exhibiting exactly the traits he counsels – humility and self-awareness, though he would call it the COAL toolkit (curiosity, openness, acceptance and love – don't get me started on the acronyms) – he neutralises the hostility that I (critics and adolescents being in this respect indistinguishable) would naturally exhibit.</p><p>So I may as well admit to finding some of his arguments appealing and even beautiful. He insists on the plasticity of the brain, the fact that it&nbsp;can change at any age, open itself up&nbsp;to&nbsp;different approaches, access different areas, always increase its power. His counsel has a determined, unswervable generosity: it insists that&nbsp;you do think about your own attachments, what fears of rejection or loss you might be masking, in the fears you think are for your children. Although the practical advice is the most repetitive area, it does speak of an intense, humane desire on&nbsp;the author's part to do more than promulgate ideas: to get his readers actively interrogating their own feelings, actively extending their own&nbsp;empathy, actively \"harmonising\" that process (his word), so that self‑examination isn't indulgent or isolating, but rather, is the beginning of&nbsp;honesty.</p><p>The book is an extension of <a href=\"http://www.drdansiegel.com/about/mindsight/\" title=\"\">Siegel's work on \"mindsight\"</a> – this process of&nbsp;insight, empathy and integration –&nbsp;explained in sentences that occasionally I don't understand. \"Information is when energy flow represents something … And this movement across time, this flow that we are saying is an aspect of the mind, is all about energy and information and&nbsp;how it changes across time.\" I&nbsp;remember someone's dad saying to me when I started university and was intimidated by a lecturer: \"I used to think when someone said something I didn't understand, that they were more intelligent than me. Now I just think they're not expressing themselves very well.\"</p><p>But even in remembering that to criticise him, I make Siegel's deeper point: that sensitive adults, who don't have to be parents, who talk to you honestly, who can see your distress and don't belittle it, who understand your point of view and put theirs in a way that doesn't patronise you – those people will stay with you for the rest of&nbsp;your life.</p>","headline":"Brainstorm review – 'How to cope with teenagers'","trailText":"Daniel J Siegel's bestselling exploration of the purpose and power of the teenage brain may not be thoroughly scientific in its approach, but it does make for an honest inquiry","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395769741335/human-brain.-Image-shot-2-004.jpg","wordcount":"1134","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T16:42:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/27/brainstorm-review-daniel-j-siegel-can-adolescent-brain-save-world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/27/brainstorm-review-daniel-j-siegel-can-adolescent-brain-save-world","tags":[{"id":"books/scienceandnature","webTitle":"Science and nature","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/scienceandnature","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/scienceandnature","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"books/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/society","references":[]},{"id":"profile/zoewilliams","webTitle":"Zoe Williams","rcsId":"GNL458943","r2ContributorId":"16584","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/19/1379597898133/Zoe-Williams.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733751535/ZoeWilliams.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoewilliams","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/zoewilliams","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432969223","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395769736224/human-brain.-Image-shot-2-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Alamy","photographer":"Sebastian Kaulitzki / Alamy","altText":"human brain.

I only want for you to be happy. But I would also like to hurt you because you have earned it and in order to tame you like a little wild animal. So be careful, you.\"</p><p>Later, in the letter which has been ripped up, the author writes of how he doesn't like Morpurgo's friends \"because I am a little jealous of them and don't like the fact that you look forward to being with them\", adding: \"I know I cannot keep you in a cage like a bird.\"</p><p>The collection of letters and photographs are to be auctioned at the New York antiquarian book fair next week by booksellers Peter Harrington, who are expecting they could fetch up to £47,500.</p><p>\"[The letters] show romantic flirting, and a rather sadistic side to Fleming as well,\" said senior specialist Adam Douglas. \"They were written so early in his career that he was of course not famous … so the chances of somebody keeping this kind of material are quite low … They're by an author well before he became an author, playing around with the things he would turn to gold.\"</p><p>The same letter in which Fleming talks of how he would like to hurt Morpurgo also reveals a more loving side to the relationship, with the author writing: \"I'd like to sleep with you just once and do nothing to you, just wrap my arms around you and hold you tight and find you there when I wake up.\"</p><p>Fleming also includes two illustrations for Morpurgo: the first, inscribed with \"<em>Wo ich Dich küssen will</em>\" – \"where I want to kiss you\" – is of a pair of eyes and a pair of feet with kisses at the \"implied mouth, breasts and vagina positions\", says Peter Harrington in its catalogue. The second, titled \"<em>Ich will mit Dir</em>\" – \"I want to ... with you\", is of a door with a Do Not Disturb sign on it, with two pairs of shoes on each side.</p><p>Fleming's biographer Andrew Lycett said the author spent time in Austria in the late 1920s before studying at Geneva University, working at Reuters, and in 1933 joining the small London bank Cull &amp; Co. He appears to have met Morpurgo in Austria in 1934, as he liked returning to the country, said Lycett.</p><p>The letters are not all dated, but those with dates place the relationship in 1934 and 1935, when Fleming would have been in his mid-20s.</p><p>Morpurgo, born four years after the author, in 1912, would go on to marry Julius Jakob David Essinger in 1939. The couple, and their two-year-old daughter, died in Auschwitz, said Peter Harrington.</p><p>The bookseller bought the collection at auction, and believes they were originally sold by a descendent of Morpurgo's family. \"These letters show the trajectory of a passionate youthful romance, when Fleming was an unmarried man in his 20s,\" said Lycett.</p><p>Fleming's emotions are seen passing through the full range of an affair as the letters progress. Early on, he is filled with loving good humour, writing that \"I only want to kiss you and say nothing. It makes no sense, but I send you the pieces – of my HEART!!!!\", and teasing Morpurgo, whom he calls a \"high class ninny\".</p><p>Later, things take on a sourer note, with Fleming writing: \"You, if you wanted to hurt me, you have done so and you can be glad that you have brought our friendship to a hideous end.\" He tells Morpurgo: \"I have found myself feeling like a child in front of its malicious governess. At the end, I could do no right and everything was a personal injury to you.\"</p><p>The whereabouts of the letters Morpurgo, who would have been in her early 20s at the time, wrote to Fleming are not known, but her missives were clearly fiery in tone. At one point Fleming writes: \"I have always called you Morpurgo and you live as Morpurgo in my reminiscences, and Morpurgo you will remain, swear as much as you like.

obituary","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-26T18:31:20Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2014/mar/26/lucius-shepard","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nq9q","standfirst":"Author of fiction that defied classification","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Lucius Shepard, an American writer whose elegant style and idiosyncratic imagination made his fiction more or less unclassifiable, was often identified with the magic realists of South America. He was also accepted in the US as a more conventional science fiction and fantasy author. But, essentially, his beautiful writing  set him apart from any genre that might have had claims to adopt him.</p><p>Shepard, who has died aged 70 of complications from a stroke, came late to writing and was nearly 40 before his first work was published. Although he wrote several novels, his favoured format was the novella, a difficult and uneconomic vehicle for publishers; this preference almost certainly held back the recognition he deserved.</p><p>Nonetheless he was a multiple award-winner and his work was of a consistently high order. Soon after his first publication in 1983, he won the <a href=\"http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/campbell.htm\" title=\"John W. Campbell Award\">John W Campbell award</a> for best new writer in science fiction (1985), and claimed a <a href=\"http://www.sfwa.org/nebula-awards/\" title=\"Nebula Award\">Nebula award</a> the following year for a novella, called R&amp;R, that was later incorporated into his second novel, Life During Wartime (1987). He also won the <a href=\"http://www.shirleyjacksonawards.org/\" title=\"Shirley Jackson Award\">Shirley Jackson award</a> for his novella Vacancy (2009).</p><p>Shephard's death leaves the sense that his best work had not yet been done. His writing has hardly been published in the UK, although ebooks have recently become available and one of his best works, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780575089921\" title=\"The Dragon Griaule\">The Dragon Griaule</a>, was issued in 2013 in Britain. His writing was shielded from wider appreciation because of its association with the science fiction genre.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lucius-shepard.com/\" title=\"Lucius Shepard website with biography\">Shepard was born in Lynchburg</a>, Virginia, but was raised in the resort town of Daytona, Florida. His parents, Lucy and William, were both teachers. Lucy, who taught Spanish, took the family to Latin America several times, which had a lasting influence on Lucius's work. In Florida, he grew up taking the presence of the ocean for granted, but was fascinated by the closeness of the tracts of bush behind the strip malls and racetracks of Daytona. He claimed to have seen a wild black panther in the forest, which he suspected might have been the last one alive in the US.</p><p>His father used threats and violence to force him to read the classics, ensuring that he grew up familiar with Thucydides and Shakespeare – but also with an abiding fear and hatred of home life. Well-read but traumatised, he left at the first opportunity, boarding a freighter for Ireland at the age of 15. It was the beginning of a long period of restless travel, and for years he crisscrossed Europe, Asia and North Africa.</p><p>Returning to the US, Shepard entered the <a href=\"http://unc.edu/\" title=\"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, where he met and married Joy Wolf. They dropped out of college several times to travel, often to Latin America. During one journey to California in 1967, their car broke down in Detroit, and to pay for the repairs they were forced to stay in the city and take jobs. There Lucius joined the first of several rock bands – he found the itinerant lifestyle and drugs culture compatible with his own outlook. His son Gullivar was born at this time. Later he returned to Chapel Hill to complete his course.</p><p>In 1980, as a turbulent marriage was coming to an end, Shepard attended a <a href=\"http://clarion.ucsd.edu/\" title=\"Clarion Writers Workshop\">Clarion writers' workshop</a> at Michigan State University. He felt at the time that his life was in ruins, and writing gave him a purpose. He responded well to the literary guidance offered by visiting authors such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/25/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"Damon Knight\">Damon Knight</a>, <a href=\"http://katewilhelm.com/sample-page/\" title=\"Kate Wilhelm\">Kate Wilhelm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kitreed.net/\" title=\"Kit Reed\">Kit Reed</a>. Although he had long been writing for his own interest, after the workshop he began creating in earnest for publication.</p><p>Politically, Shepard was an American liberal, a stance recognisable in his journalism as well as his fiction. He was enthusiastic about American football and boxing, and was a regular film reviewer for the <a href=\"http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/\" title=\"Magazine of Fantasy  Science Fiction\">Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</a> – making clear whenever possible his dislike of mainstream Hollywood films.</p><p>He is survived by Gullivar.</p><p><em>• </em>Lucius Shepard, writer, born 21 August 1943; died 18 March 2014</p><p></p><p><em>• </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QObAlkuVcIk\" title=\"YouTube\">BBC Radio 4 dramatisation of Shepard's story Delta Sly Honey</a></p>","headline":"Lucius Shepard obituary","trailText":"Author of fiction that defied classification","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395854767916/lucius-shepard-006.jpg","wordcount":"676","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-09T16:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/26/lucius-shepard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/26/lucius-shepard","tags":[{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/science-fiction","webTitle":"Science fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/science-fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/science-fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/fantasy","webTitle":"Fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fantasy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fantasy","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"profile/christopher-priest","webTitle":"Christopher Priest","r2ContributorId":"43435","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/29/1301401255908/Christopher-Priest-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Christopher Priest is a British novelist.

While it has been established beyond doubt that the plane crashed into the ocean, with no survivors, the families of the dead understandably refuse to accept this conclusion. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, people are pulled from the wreckage of a collapsed building after the search and rescue efforts have given way to the grim duty of recovery. The loss a vessel with all hands, a mass death from which no one escapes, is not inconceivable, but the idea of such a thing being incommunicable is so dreadful that we cling to the hope of a survivor long after it is plausible. Hence the power and reassurance of the lines from Job quoted by Herman Melville in the epilogue to <em>Moby-Dick</em>. \"And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\" The black box embodies this idea of the survivor's story and testimony even in a situation where the loss of life has been total. Face to face with his fate, one of the last things Robert Redford's unnamed sailor does in the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155232/all-is-lost\" title=\"\"><em>All Is Lost</em></a> is to write a brief message, put it in a bottle and throw it overboard. All may be lost – but the hope is that this hand-scrawled version of the black box, will be found. If it is not … We have seen in the last few weeks the speed with which theories and conspiracies whoosh into the information vacuum. In the absence of reliable facts we are left with the lines repeated hypnotically by Conrad at the end of <em>The Secret Agent</em>: \"An impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang forever over this act of madness or despair.\" In a post-post-religious age the inexplicable has retreated, like some endangered animal, to the wild and dangerous places of the imagination. The flipside of this is an increasing hunger for such sightings, a thirst for stories of inexplicable survival.</p><p>An extreme example occurred shortly before MH370 went missing, when the Mexican fisherman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/12/homecoming-for-pacific-castaway-jos-salvador-alvarenga\" title=\"\">José Salvador Alvarenga</a> was found after drifting at sea for 13 months. Amazement that he had survived for so long on a diet of raw turtles and rain water soon turned to suspicion. This is hardly surprising given a history of fictional tales passing themselves off as fact – or of fact being turned into fiction – so lengthy that it reaches back to the dawn of the English novel. The real-life castaway Alexander Selkirk was the basis for Robinson Crusoe, whose adventures, the first edition claimed, were \"written by himself\", not by Daniel Defoe. Meticulously itemised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/williamgolding\" title=\"\">William Golding</a> in the novel <em>Pincher Martin</em>, the survival of the eponymous hero on a bare rock in the ocean is revealed, in the last lines, to have been not only a fiction – we knew that from the outset – but a parable. Even the fiction turns out to have been a fiction. Paradoxically, the more strictly stories of survival are stripped to their practical essentials the more readily they accumulate larger resonances. In his struggle to stay afloat Redford is like Sisyphus who, Camus insisted, we must imagine \"happy\". At one point, as one bit of ill-fortune is followed by another, Redford seems about to scream \"Fuck\". It never becomes a word, just a long howl of anguish: \"Fffwwuuuh…\" Apart from this moment, he is in his element. This is what he came to sea for. And it would be wrong, as we hear those fateful words, \"All is lost\", to take this as an admission of regret. It would be just as accurate to say that he has achieved his destination.</p><p>Compared with <em>All Is Lost</em>, <em>Cast Away</em> with Tom Hanks is a lavishly stranded epic. The aircraft in which Hanks and his colleagues are flying crashes into the sea, forced far from its presumed course by a storm. The search is called off, there are no survivors. But Hanks has survived, washed up on an island where he lives for four emaciated and bearded years on crabs, coconut milk and rain water. Various items from the plane float to the shore and prove useful – a pair of ice-skates is essential for sorting out his dental problems. But the best discovery, perhaps because it has no use value, is a Wilson volleyball. Hanks paints eyes and a mouth on it. Over the years, as it decays, it sprouts a tuft of hair and there develops, between man and ball, one of the great relationships in the history of cinema. In one scene, Hanks throws the ball away; afterwards there's a lovely post-row make-up with him on charming best behaviour – \"I know you, I know you!\" – as Wilson's usual silence acquires an impossible suggestion of hurt and sulk. This, of course, is not a relationship between equals. Wilson is not just Hanks's companion: he is also an altar and a god. A god created by the castaway's need. Eventually, after the two of them have left the island on a cobbled-together raft, Wilson is washed away. Hanks swims after him, reaches out his hand only to watch him drift from sight on what may or may not be Matthew Arnold's \"sea of faith\". Hanks, at that point, is so physically and psychically shattered as to be beyond hope and faith.</p><p>For most of <em>All Is Lost</em> the focus is so tight as to avoid the undertow of symbolic, religious or allegorical meaning – and is, as a result, unusually vulnerable to them. (Hamlet didn't call it a sea of troubles for nothing.) Redford is constantly trying to mend his boat. Unable to repair it he concentrates on slowing the rate of its deterioration. Even when he has only the brightness of his teeth to see by he's still trying something. That howl – \"Fffwwuuuh …\" – is the nearest he comes to prayer, after which he resumes the doomed chores of patching, pumping, fixing, plotting.</p><p>Shortly after seeing <em>All Is Lost</em> I saw the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/movies/charlie-victor-romeo-depicts-doomed-flights.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">film adaptation of the stage play <em>Charlie Victor Romeo</em></a>. Set in the cramped confines of the flight decks of aircraft as various real-life emergencies unfold, the dialogue – both between the crew and between crew and air traffic control – is derived entirely from transcripts from cockpit voice recorders. Some of the incidents end with the plane landing safely, others with the deaths of everyone onboard. During a Q&amp;A after the screening a member of the audience expressed surprise that there were no prayers, no mention of religion or god. The reason, it was explained, is that there's no time. In emergencies, as we have heard repeatedly in the last few weeks, pilots abide by the priorities of the abbreviation ANC: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. According to Tom Wolfe, test pilots such as Chuck Yeager who possess \"the right stuff\" are distinguished by the ability to think quickly and logically in suddenly catastrophic situations: \"I've tried A – I've tried B – I've tried C.\" The Chilean miners did a lot of praying, partly because they had so much time on their hands.</p><p>Which brings us back to where we began, to the hopes and prayers of families who had loved ones aboard MH370 and – spoiler alert – to the end of <em>All Is Lost</em>. Is the hand following a beam of light through the ocean and reaching down, Michelangelo-like, to the drowning Redford, an implausible cop-out or a religious salvation? Since these are, in a way, synonyms, it is both.</p><p>It is also strangely reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dhlawrence\" title=\"\">DH Lawrence</a>'s great long poem \"The Ship of Death\". Few people can have lived their lives with such a consciousness of death as Lawrence – though this often manifested itself as a wilful refusal to attribute his ill-health to the tuberculosis that would kill him. Even when he was forced to go to a sanatorium, the aptly-named Ad Astra, Lawrence grumbled, in one of his last letters, \"this place no good\". It's as though, having exhausted all other options, he&nbsp;could at least express chronic dissatisfaction with this world. But in the posthumously published poem he confronted his death directly, through the image of a boat sailing slowly into deeper and deeper darkness until it is completely enveloped by it:</p><blockquote><p>And everything is gone, the body is gone <br />completely under, gone,<br />entirely gone. <br />The upper darkness is heavy as the lower,<br />between them the little ship<br />is gone <br />she is gone.<br />It is the end, it is oblivion.</p></blockquote><p>Few pieces of writing bring the reader this close to the incommunicable experience of death, of nonexistence. The end is as uncompromising and absolute as the verdict that flight MH370 went into the water, that there are no survivors. But the poem is not at an end. It continues:</p><blockquote><p>And yet out of eternity a thread <br />separates itself on the blackness, <br />a horizontal thread<br />that fumes a little with pallor upon the dark. <br />Is it illusion? or does the pallor fume <br />A little higher? <br />Ah wait, wait, for there's the dawn, <br />the cruel dawn of coming back to life<br />out of oblivion.</p></blockquote><p>• Geoff Dyer's new book, <em>Another Great Day at Sea</em>, about life aboard an American aircraft carrier, will be&nbsp;published in May.</p>","headline":"Flight MH370 and the solace of survivors'

from Zadie Smith, Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk, Salman Rushdie and other writers says Turkey's social media ban is an 'unacceptable violation of the right to freedom of speech'","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Turkey's Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk has said that the situation in his country \"is going from bad to worse and even towards terrible\" following the government's attempts to block access to Twitter, as a phalanx of major writers, from Zadie Smith to Günter Grass, line up to state their \"grave concern\" about \"the freedom of words\" in Turkey today.</p><p>The authors, who also include Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Karl Ove Knausgaard, and Grass and Pamuk's fellow Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek, have added their names to a joint letter from <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org\" title=\"\">PEN International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org\" title=\"\">English PEN</a> which calls last week's ban on Twitter \"an unacceptable violation of the right to freedom of speech\". The Turkish government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-prime-minister\" title=\"\">restricted access to the micro-blogging website</a>, and prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  indicated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/turkey-erdogan-facebook-youtube-ban-elections\" title=\"\">the ban could be extended further</a>, saying he would not \"leave this nation at the mercy of YouTube and Facebook\" and pledging to \"take the necessary steps in the strongest way\".</p><p>On Thursday, he appeared to follow up that threat as Turkish media reported that the country's telecommunications authority (TİB) had blocked YouTube as a \"precautionary administrative measure\". The latest curbs came hours after an audio recording of a high-level security meeting was leaked on the video-sharing website. Turkey previously banned YouTube in 2007, but lifted the ban three years later.</p><p>According to PEN, the Twitter ban currently remains in place despite an administrative court order on 26 March ordering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/turkish-court-lifts-twitter-ban\" title=\"\">its suspension pending a court judgment</a>.</p><p>Pamuk, who won the Nobel in 2006, not long after Turkish state prosecutors had charged him with \"insulting Turkishness\" for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/12/nobelprize.awardsandprizes\" title=\"\">remarks he made to an interviewer</a>, told the Guardian \"there were times in Turkey when free speech was equally bad … as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/turkey.youtube\" title=\"\">in 2008 when YouTube was closed</a>. But at that time we were at least hopeful about the future. Not now. The situation here is going from bad to worse, and even towards terrible.\"</p><p>Pamuk's translator Maureen Freely, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/maureen-freely-pen-friendship\" title=\"\">new president of English PEN</a>, added: \"The real worry, I think, is that Erdoğan now seems to have the power to do whatever he wishes, whenever he wishes. And that is why we're so concerned about what he'll do next, to silence dissenters and crush opposition wherever he sees it.\"</p><p>The signatories to the letter point to the fact that Turkey ranks 154th&nbsp;among 180 countries on the <a href=\"https://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php\" title=\"\">World Press Freedom Index</a>, saying that even today, \"translators, editors, publishers, poets and writers face criminal proceedings and even imprisonment for legitimate expression under a variety of legislative fetters\". <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org/turkey-focus-2013-muharrem-erbey\" title=\"\">PEN particularly highlighted the case of Muharrem Erbey</a>, a human rights lawyer and writer who was arrested in 2009, and who is currently in prison awaiting trial. PEN believes the charges against the author are politically motivated, and that Erbey is being held because of his alleged affiliation with Kurdish political parties. The free speech organisation is calling for his immediate release.</p><p>In their letter, the writers – from Turkey and around the world – are asking Turkey's leaders \"not to retreat from democracy and its keystone, freedom of speech; but rather to recognise their obligations under international treaties and to lift the block on Twitter with immediate effect\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433193842'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2011/2/17/1297959958419/Cif-Elif-Shafak-007.jpg' alt='Cif: Elif Shafak' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'Democracy in Turkey is sorely lacking' … Turkish writer Elif Shafak was tried for 'insulting Turkishness'</figcaption></figure><p>\"We urge them to remember that this beautiful country will be stronger and happier when, and if, it appreciates pluralism, diversity and the freedom of words,\" they write. \"We welcome the administrative court in Ankara's decision to suspend the [Twitter] ban ahead of a full judgment and urge the telecommunications authority to restore access to Twitter immediately.\"</p><p>The Turkish author Elif Shafak, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/21/turkey.world\" title=\"\">who was also tried for \"insulting Turkishness\"</a> following the publication of her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/29/fiction.features1\" title=\"\">The Bastard of Istanbul</a>, is one of the authors to sign the letter. \"Turkey's rulers need to understand that democracy is not solely about getting a majority of votes in the ballot box. Far beyond that, democracy is a culture of inclusiveness, openness, human rights and freedom of speech, for each and every one, regardless of whichever party they might have voted for. It is the realisation of the very core of democracy that has been sorely lacking in Turkey today,\" said Shafak, whose trial – based on words uttered by fictional characters in her novel – went on for a year before charges were dropped.</p><p>The letter comes in the wake of a <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/turkey-end-human-rights-violations-against-writers-and-journalists\" title=\"\">new report from PEN International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org\" title=\"\">English PEN</a> on the Gezi Park protests last year, and their impact on freedom of expression. \"The excessive use of police force, as well as widespread media censorship and reprisals against journalists and users of social media, starkly illustrated the shortcomings of Turkish democracy in its lack of pluralism and disregard for fundamental rights and freedoms,\" says the report. It also lists the \"human rights violations\" that took place during the protests and calls on the Turkish government to, among other things, ensure freedom of expression is respected  and peaceful protestors are not \"arbitrarily detained\". PEN International and English PEN also wants the right to peaceful assembly included in Turkey's proposed new constitution.</p>","headline":"Turkey and Twitter: major authors join PEN International

Teasing out this book's many strands, influences and implications has been fascinating – and bewildering. What does it all mean? I'm still not sure. Maybe nothing, if you believe <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ATalkWithPhilipK.DickOnHour25In1976\" title=\"\">what the author said</a> in 1976:</p><blockquote><p>\"You don't just write whatever comes into your head while you're sitting there in front of the typewriter. When I wrote UBIK, I got about 12 pages done and couldn't think of anything else, so l just wrote whatever came into my mind. I wrote it from my unconscious: I let the right hemisphere of my brain do all the thinking, and I was as surprised as anybody as to what came out. In France, of course, it's considered a great novel because it doesn't make any sense; in France, it's a r<em>oman de pataphysique</em>.\"</p></blockquote><p>Darn it! But the fact that all that complication and drama in Ubik may not add up to anything also enables it to add up to everything. It is a novel of infinite possibility. It's a bravura display of narrative uncertainty. And Dick is a master at holding his readers' attention while everything falls apart.</p><p>All of which makes me very pleased to announce that we're going to be joined by Jeff VanderMeer at 1pm on Friday 28 March for this month's live webchat. Anyone who has read VanderMeer's award-winning fiction – and especially his latest novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/05/annihilation-review-jeff-vandermeer-afraid-turn-page\" title=\"\">Annihilation</a> - will be aware that this writer also knows a thing or two about keeping his readers guessing. And since definite answers about Ubik are so hard to come by, it seems a good idea to alter our usual formula slightly and question someone who has an affinity for Dick's kind of writing as well as expertise on the author's life and times.</p><p>Annihilation is full of the unease and mystery that make Dick's books so fascinating – and notably, in fine Philip K Dick style – it was <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/lincolnmichel/jeff-vandermeer\" title=\"\">inspired by a dream</a>.  Judging by the buzz about the book, and the reviews its been getting, that was an excellent night's work.</p><p>I'm sure it's going to be intriguing to hear about the creation of this work, not to mention VanderMeer's influences, what he thinks of Dick himself and his opinions on the history of this kind of speculative fiction. Although we have invited Jeff primarily as a creative artist, it's also worth noting that he's no slouch on this latter subject, having co-edited a number of highly respected SF anthologies such as <a href=\"http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2011/08/30/table-of-contents-the-weird-edited-by-ann-and-jeff-vandermeer/\" title=\"\">The Weird</a>. While I'm noting his qualifications, I should also say that he is the winner of two World Fantasy awards as well as a finalist for the Hugo awards and significantly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick_Award\" title=\"\">the Philip K Dick award</a>. (He has also chaired the panel of judges for the latter.) He was also the editor and publisher of <a href=\"http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2012/07/01/cheeky-frawg-news-stepan-chapmans-pkd-award-winning-the-troika/\">The Troika by Stepan Chapman</a>, which won a PKD award and was very influenced by Philip K Dick and Ubik.</p><p>But really, I don't need to say much more to introduce Jeff VanderMeer because his words speak for themselves. You can <a href=\"http://io9.com/read-the-mesmerizing-first-chapter-of-jeff-vandermeers-1520682658\" title=\"\">read the first chapter of Annihilation here</a>.

Not only did he condemn many people, perhaps hundreds, to cruel and ignominious deaths, he also clandestinely manipulated some of the&nbsp;leading figures in western security services for decades, charming out of them all manner of the most sensitive information and passing it on to the KGB. As more than one of his dupes ruefully observed, he fooled them all.</p><p>Yet what kind of power is it that the double agent enjoys? Of the people Philby moved among – wives, lovers, children, friends, fond colleagues – not&nbsp;a single one was taken into his confidence. He hugged his secret to him and, one presumes, fed his ego on&nbsp;it. That is a kind of power, certainly. \"Philby enjoyed deception,\" Macintyre writes. \"Like secrecy, the erotic charge of infidelity can be hard to renounce. Some men like to parade their knowledge. Others revel in the possession of&nbsp;information that they decline to share, and the private sense of superiority that this brings.\"</p><p>Even his Russian handler, the suave and sophisticated Yuri Modin, who ran the Cambridge spy network, found Philby to be an enigma. Modin wrote of him: \"He never revealed his true self. Neither the British, nor the women he lived with, nor ourselves [the KGB] ever managed to pierce the armour of mystery that&nbsp;clad him … in the end I suspect that Philby made a mockery of everyone, particularly ourselves.\"</p><p>This is surely right, but only to a point. Philby would have hotly denied the charge of mockery. In an interview with the journalist Phillip Knightley in Moscow in 1988, he was adamant: \"I don't like deceiving people, especially friends, and contrary to what others think, I feel very badly about it.\" Bad he may have felt, but he never faltered. After his defection to Moscow he was joined by his third wife, Eleanor, who one day asked him what was more important in his life, her and their children, or the Communist party. \"The party, of&nbsp;course,\" he answered. One reads this exchange with a shiver, yet with a certain admiration, too. How many of us would have the steel to give ourselves over so unwaveringly to a cause?</p><p>In all the books, articles and memoirs in which Philby has figured it is striking how little attention, indeed, how much credence, is given to his belief in&nbsp;the communist revolution. The&nbsp;question is asked over and over: how could he do it? How could he deceive his family, friends and colleagues? How could he betray so many agents in the field, to&nbsp;be shot at border posts or sent into the Lubyanka to face torture and execution? The answer, at one level, is&nbsp;simple. He had&nbsp;a faith, and he never lost it.</p><p>For those whom he deceived, Philby had to be made into a grandmaster of duplicity, a great and terrible genius; if&nbsp;he were anything less, they would seem even more careless, gullible and plain stupid than they were. The fact is, however, Philby was a perfectly ordinary product of his time and milieu, except for one thing, the ferocity of his commitment to a cause. \"What Philby's enemies described as betrayal,\" Macintyre writes, \"he saw as&nbsp;loyalty.\" For all his clubbability, for all the drinks parties he gave and the cricket matches he attended, Philby was a fanatic, and fanaticism is something that we in the secular and more or less democratic west find almost impossible to understand.</p><p>Simply put, we have forgotten what it is to be seized by the force of an idea. <a href=\"http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/index.html\" title=\"\">Isaiah Berlin</a>, contemplating the \"ideological storms\" that swept through the 20th century, cautioned that \"it is as well to realise that these great movements began with ideas in people's heads: ideas about what relations between men have been, are, might be, and should be; and to realise how they came to be transformed in the name of a vision of some supreme goal in the minds of the leaders, above all of the prophets with armies at their backs.\"</p><p>For all that we might marvel at Philby's unwavering loyalty to the party, it is easy to sympathise with the&nbsp;wounded bafflement of the people who were closest to him professionally, or who thought themselves closest to&nbsp;him, such as his MI6 colleague Nicholas Elliott and the CIA chief James Jesus Angleton, both of whom he took in, chewed on, and spat out with not a moment's hesitation or, for all his protestations, real remorse.</p><p>Philby's friend and fellow spy, the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a>, famously remarked that \"in the lost childhood of&nbsp;Judas Christ was betrayed\". In the case of Philby, commentators reach back into his earliest days in search of a&nbsp;solution to the conundrum that he represents. There are those who point to the love-hate relations between him and his doughty father, the Arabist St John Philby, as the source of a violent drive towards duplicity and betrayal. It&nbsp;seems a dubious proposition.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432323108'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395079407738/kim-philby-002.jpg' alt='kim philby' width='140' height='215' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In this context it is useful to turn to <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849546997\" title=\"\"><strong>Kim Philby: The Unknown Story of the KGB's Master Spy</strong></a>, the late Tim Milne's finely written and refreshingly unhysterical book. He and&nbsp;Philby were pupils together at Westminster, where Milne's first and peculiarly apposite memory of his friend is of \"a very small boy happily trying to squash a bigger boy behind a&nbsp;cupboard door\". Milne, grandson of the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh, would later serve in MI6 – was there anyone in that circle who did not do his and sometimes even her stint as a spy? – and is sceptical of the Oedipal theory as an explanation of Philby's betrayals. St John Philby had been a popular success at Westminster, but \"Kim was uninterested in trying to emulate … these successes, nor did he give the impression of having turned his back on them because he knew he would fall short of his father's achievement: it was merely that he thought he had better things to do.\"</p><p>Philby travelled in Germany as a student – Milne gives fascinating and revealing accounts of his friend's behaviour and attitudes at this time – and later he worked as a journalist in Spain, where, thanks to his cover as a&nbsp;Nationalist sympathiser, he was decorated by Franco himself; it was one&nbsp;of the many ironies of Philby's extraordinary life that besides this signal honour he was also awarded medals by both Britain and the Soviet Union.</p><p>As with many young Englishmen of&nbsp;his generation, the spectacle of the Nazi takeover in Germany, and then of the atrocities of the Spanish civil war, drove him to communism. Unlike most of the others, however, he dedicated his life to the overthrow of capitalism. But did he truly believe in the cause? Milne writes, \"To become a communist is one thing; to remain a communist is&nbsp;quite another\" and goes on to quote Philby's own account of the Pascalian wager that he made: \"It cannot be so&nbsp;very surprising that I adopted a Communist viewpoint in the 1930s; so&nbsp;many of my contemporaries made the same choice. But many of those who made that choice in those days changed sides when some of the worst&nbsp;features of Stalinism became apparent. I stayed the course.\" With that mixture of candour and what Greene called Philby's \"chilling certainty\" there is no arguing.</p><p>Yet we must beware of being lulled into accepting Philby's own estimate of&nbsp;himself and his motives. Nothing in&nbsp;life is simple, and in Philby's life in particular every layer gave on to other, deeper layers. There is the fact that for all his leftwing convictions he was also a snob. \"In some ways,\" Macintyre shrewdly suggests, \"Philby's story is that of a man in pursuit of ever more exclusive clubs,\" and what could be more exclusive than a club that has only one member?</p><p>And then there is the performance itself, in which a move was never missed or a line fluffed. Nietzsche recognised that to be truly convincing to others a man must learn to impersonate himself; as one of his closest friends observed of Philby, \"he was the greatest actor in the world\". And at the&nbsp;start of each day's performance he&nbsp;must pray, along with Samuel Butler: \"Vouchsafe O Lord to keep us&nbsp;this day without being found out.\"</p><p>It might seem that by now Philby as a subject had been done to death, but as these two books amply illustrate, he&nbsp;is still a source of fascination and&nbsp;wonderment. Macintyre writes with&nbsp;the diligence and insight of a journalist, and the panache of a born storyteller, concentrating on Philby's friendship with and betrayal of Elliott and of Angleton, his pathetically dedicated admirer at the top of the CIA. Macintyre's account of the verbal duel between Elliott and Philby in their final confrontation in Beirut in 1963 is&nbsp;worthy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnlecarre\" title=\"\">John le Carré</a> at his best – and indeed, Le Carré contributes an afterword, which is as eloquent in what it does not say as in what it does. Milne, for his part, treats his old friend&nbsp;and deceiver with surprising tenderness. \"I do not regret knowing him,\" he writes. \"He enriched my world for many years and I owed a lot&nbsp;to him.\" The Philby charm held good to the bitter end.</p><p>And speaking of ends, have we learned all there is to know about Philby the master spy? What exactly did Yuri Modin mean when he spoke of Philby having made \"a mockery of everyone, particularly ourselves\"? When it comes to spying, Jim Angleton used to say, we are in a hall of mirrors, in which everything is reflected doubly, triply, endlessly…</p><p>• John Banville's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781447236689\" title=\"\"><em>The Black-Eyed Blonde</em></a><em> </em>(written as Benjamin Black) is published by Mantle.

But what of the worst mums in fiction?","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>A quick glance at the racks of Mother's Day cards would turn anyone off motherhood: of course we love our mothers, but really – would we truly express it like that? And is there a faint feeling that the more extreme, gushing cards might be chosen by those whose relationships with their mothers are not, in fact, perfect? So it might be refreshing to take a turn round some imperfect parents in fiction: here we go with the bad mothers' literary litany.</p><p>Mrs Bennet from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/pride-prejudice-200th-anniversary\" title=\"\">is always Exhibit A</a> – but her real crime seems to be that she embarrasses her sensitive children. Read it as a teenager and you wince for poor mortified Lizzie and Jane, thinking perhaps of times when our own mother said the wrong thing. The older reader – more robust, a parent – can think it is the positive duty and pleasure of a mother to embarrass her child from time to time, to stop them getting on their high horse. And, as apologists of Mrs B have pointed out, at least she is trying to do something about the family's woeful situation: she appreciates the poverty and misery that will face them all if marriages are not made. Perfect papa Mr B – so lovely, so witty at the expense of his family – appears not to give a toss about what will happen to his daughters.</p><p>Charles Dickens had an extremely difficult relationship with both of his parents – they were feckless, and he felt they let him down badly – and mothers do not come off well in the books. His picture of his own mother is Mrs Nickleby – mother to Nicholas and Kate – and is quite painful. She is incompetent, foolish, and no good in a sickroom – \"coming into the room with an elaborate caution, calculated to discompose the nerves of an invalid rather more than the entry of a horse-soldier at full gallop\" – very unhelpful given the amount of illness and nursing occurring in the oeuvre. Mrs Copperfield, horribly, fails to protect David from his stepfather, while Bleak House's Mrs Jellyby lets the children fall downstairs and get their heads stuck in railings because she is so busy with her charitable works.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/marilynne-robinson\" title=\"\">Marilynne Robinson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\" title=\"\">Housekeeping</a>, Lucille and Ruth's mother commits suicide, leaving them to face an uncertain future. In Nick Hornby's About a Boy, the mother attempts suicide in a situation where the boy Marcus will find her and – much worse – cuts his hair for him (\"fashion is stupid, baa, sheep\"), part of what stops him fitting in at school.</p><p>The mother in Arthur Ransome's children's classic, Swallows and Amazons, is something of a cipher, but her inability to make basic decisions does mean she receives one of the finest telegrams in all literature. Asked if the children may go on an adventurous sailing-and-camping expedition, the absent father replies, heartlessly: \"Better drowned than duffers if not duffers will not drown.\"</p><p>In children's books of that era (the Ransome was published in 1930), parents are nearly always absent or dead in order to clear the decks for adventure and excitement, and in some adult books the same easy path is taken. The over-productive romance writer Ruby M Ayres gave us a very bad mother in her 1924 book Ribbons and Lace. The heroine, who changes her name to Linda Lovelace (yes really) is left to fend for herself and her grandmother when her father dies, leaving them penniless – the mother wanders off in search of a better life, although she does turn up again when there is some prospect of Linda marrying money. She is rotten through and through, as you feel Ayres might have put it herself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433070146'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2011/8/24/1314179894456/Still-from-Channel-4s-The-007.jpg' alt='Still from Channel 4's The Illustrated Mum' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Compulsive viewing... The TV version of The Illustrated Mum. Photograph: Channel 4</figcaption></figure><p>In modern children's books, mothers are often just plain unsatisfactory. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/may/11/costabookaward.jacquelinewilson\" title=\"\">The Illustrated Mum</a> is one of Jacqueline Wilson's many examples (tattoos and bipolar disorder), while the parents of Roald Dahl's Matilda (the small person's Carrie) are splendidly grotesque. Mrs Wormwood chose \"looks not books\". Dahl knew what he was doing: to good middle-class parents, disapproving of reading is the worst mistreatment, worse than Barbie dolls and sweets.</p><p>There are spectacularly neglectful mothers in Philip Hensher's 2011 King of the Badgers, and in Dennis Lehane's thriller Gone Baby Gone (1998) – the Lehane ending on a decision concerning the mother that must have every reader (or viewer of the 2007 film) debating the rights and wrongs of the case. These are both very working-class women – but negligence crosses the boundaries. Lady Montdore in Love in a Cold Climate greets her only daughter after the death of her first child with \"So the poor little baby died, I expect it was just as well, children are such an awful expense\". The various mothers in Vita Sackville-West's The Edwardians (1930, looking back at pre-first world war days), are heartless and unable to understand their daughters, ready to marry them off to the highest bidder. One of the daughters in the book, in love with a penniless artist, is told by her mother's friend to marry the lord who is also on the scene and, with a hideous wink, \"we'll see what can be done about the painter afterwards.\"</p><p>Evelyn Waugh's Brenda Last (in the 1934 novel Handful of Dust) takes some kind of prize: her lover and her child are both called John, and when she is told \"John is dead\" she is relieved that it is the child. The main thought that this provokes is \"How much did Waugh hate his first wife to write this fictionalised version of her?\"</p><p>But perhaps the worst one of all is in The Manchurian Candidate – she is (<strong>spoiler</strong>) controlling her brainwashed son as an assassin on orders from the KGB.</p><p>At this point we sense that Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole is ready to insist that his mother Pauline should be added to the list – but I reject that totally. She is a Mother Courage for the age, spending the child benefit on gin and fags, endless boyfriends in tow, but always turning up for her children – she's a fictional mother for real mothers to relate to.</p><p>Mothers can't win – they are mean to their children, they fail to protect them from fathers, stepfathers and random new boyfriends, they are too protective, or not enough. Looking at the literature of mothers over the past 200 years, the striking thing is that the vast majority of it is written from the perspective of a child (albeit a grown-up one) and not a parent – scores to settle, grudges to chase, fair enough. It's only slowly, and in recent years, that the voice of the mother has come out – the odd middlebrow novel of the kind Virago and Persephone rescue (<a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/consequences.html\" title=\"\">EM Delafield</a> or <a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/someone-at-a-distance.html\" title=\"\">Dorothy Whipple</a>) and more recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/16/fiction.features\" title=\"\">Margaret Drabble</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/14/julie-myerson-lost-child-review\" title=\"\">Julie Myerson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/09/biography.features\" title=\"\">Rachel Cusk</a>.</p><p>But still, I'm betting there won't be much change in the proportion of bad mothers in novels. The ground is too fertile. Which are the fictional mothers you love to hate?</p>","headline":"Bad mothers in books: a literary litany","trailText":"<p>As Mother's Day looms, we are surrounded by saintly images of perfect matriarchs.

Kat Duff is of the 'capitalism ate my sleep' school and wants a return to old-fashioned ways","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p><em>The Secret Life of Sleep</em> started out as a&nbsp;blog, for the \"sleepy, the sleepless and the curious\" written by a \"licensed counsellor\" from the New Mexican desert. It does pretty much what a drowsy browser might expect: supplies a photo of its smiling, spry author on one tab; and on another, a series of posts reflecting on sleep in a mellow, hippyish sort of way, decorated with bits of impressionist art and pictures of sleepy kittens. <em>The Secret Life of Sleep</em> book seems – except for the kitten pics – to be exactly the same. The chapters are post length and retain their chummy tone and cosy verbs, pitched neatly in the blog-place that is neither letter nor literature: \"I invite you to join me at&nbsp;the shore (of&nbsp;sleep) where we can peep into the watery depths, tickle our toes in the waves, and leave the dry land of our days behind!\"</p><p>And afloat we soon are, still on the internet's infinite, provenance-free sea of reference, where accredited sleep scientists and \"dream researchers\", scientific studies and personal anecdote, can all bob about together. The going is a little sluggish, for the posts/chapters are loosely arranged and repetitive. Sometimes, too, there is a dramatic anti-science lurch, as when Duff confesses that she \"has no way of knowing for sure\" whether her uncle, in intensive care some miles away, \"actually came to my bedside in some form\" during a dream. And the lack of firm history may make you feel queasy when, for example, Duff speculates that \"Frère Jacques\", a song based on the vigorous clanging of the matins bells, \"may have had its origins in a culture that discourages sudden awakenings\"; or when she announces that \"French writer Michel de Montaigne\" lived in the 18th century.</p><p>Never mind: out here on the info-ocean, it has always been hard to tell fact from algorithm-swollen factoid. We chug on, choppily. From the depths, an argument emerges, and actually, it's not mellow at all. In fact, it&nbsp;is quite political, as indeed is a lot of recent thinking about sleep. Under the&nbsp;homey styling, Duff proves to be of&nbsp;the new \"capitalism ate my sleep\" school of thought, with spiritual knobs on. Not only does she accept as&nbsp;a&nbsp;\"discovery\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783\" title=\"\">historian Roger Ekirch's&nbsp;extremely contentious hypothesis</a> that \"preindustrial folk\" didn't expect to&nbsp;sleep through the night, but habitually sat around for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours in the&nbsp;middle, meditating and raising their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin\" title=\"\">prolactin</a>; but she speculates that \"our preindustrial ancestors\" were better at waking up, too. They came to \"waking awareness slowly, yawning and rolling over, cuddling and cooing with bedmates\", she imagines, in a&nbsp;scene perilously close to a kitten pic. Curiously, my friend Antigona, who grew up on&nbsp;a&nbsp;thoroughly \"preindustrial\" smallholding&nbsp;in Kosovo, doesn't recall this, nor any \"visiting\" or \"brewing of beer\" in the middle of the night. She does remember, though, working late, overcrowding, long vigils tending the sick and children – how long do you think you can share a bed with a baby in preindustrial nappies? – and, especially as a mother, being constantly, desperately sleep-deprived.</p><p>Antigona was certainly superstitious about her dreams, however, and half-awake a lot of the time – both states that Duff seems to prize. Duff does not think we should \"divide and polarise the worlds we inhabit by day and by night\", and is against all modern inventions to help us do so: clocks, especially the alarm variety; artificial light; alcohol; caffeine (which she seems to implicate in the slave trade); chocolate; all drugs from chloral hydrate to Provigil; the oxygen that sleep apnea sufferers need to get through the night; and&nbsp;even the teddy bear, or&nbsp;transitional object, which here&nbsp;is a byproduct of westerners' chilly insistence on solo sleeping, \"a&nbsp;demonstration of (the baby's) innate&nbsp;creative resourcefulness in satisfying needs for physical contact\". Lullabies, you&nbsp;may be happy to learn,&nbsp;are&nbsp;culturally universal, and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;all right.</p><p>Inevitably, Duff spends a lot of time at the cot: partly because she is not at&nbsp;all interested in the sexual side of sleep; mostly because this is where sleep theorists and behaviourists and anthropologists and Mumsnetters always end up – peering, like Varka in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/sleepy.htm\" title=\"\">Chekhov's story \"Sleepy\"</a>, at a baby with colic. \"The baby's crying. For a&nbsp;long&nbsp;while he has been hoarse and exhausted with crying, but he still goes on screaming, and there is no knowing when he will stop.\" This is the sharp end of sleep, where the truism of modern therapy – that we are less happy and successful than we ought to&nbsp;be because our parents didn't love us enough in infancy – comes up against the actuality of being parents ourselves, determined to avoid that huge, yet nebulous thing: psychic damage to our infants.</p><p>It's the business end of feminism, too: how much of your preciously realised self&nbsp;are you willing to lose to your biologically determined role as a&nbsp;mother? Or to new or old ideas of how a mother should be? How much of&nbsp;your own rest are you willing to sacrifice? Especially if, like Varka, you are exhausted yourself. \"Her eyes are glued together, her head droops, her neck aches. She cannot move her eyelids or her lips, and she feels as though her face is dried and wooden, as though her head has become as small as the head of a pin.\"&nbsp;</p><p>What to do? It's no use looking to science for clear directives, for there are at least as many studies demonstrating that babies may be safely left to self-soothe as there are showing the opposite. Even Duff tiptoes a little around the contentious area of leaving the baby to cry – \"some might even say&nbsp;abandon\" – she says, saying it. But&nbsp;mostly her answer is of a&nbsp;piece with her other ideas: in accordance with the&nbsp;precepts of Jean Liedloff's <a href=\"http://www.continuum-concept.org/\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Continuum Concept</em></a>, the baby should be held all night, whether awake, asleep, wetting, or wailing, and&nbsp;this will avoid raised cortisol levels, depression in later life, and that&nbsp;teddy bear problem. Varka's solution is more direct and&nbsp;short term: she strangles the baby.</p><p>Varka is 13 and a serf, an authentic \"preindustrial\" figure drawn from Chekhov's experience as a doctor. Perhaps it was such a Cinderella who first told one of our folk tales that feature a feather bed. There are many of them – a comfortable bed is right up&nbsp;with protein meals, gold plates and&nbsp;ever-laying hens as an object of fetish – but perhaps \"The Princess and&nbsp;the Pea\" is the finest. Twenty mattresses and still not able to sleep – there goes a&nbsp;member of the ruling class! Duff is right to identify that many&nbsp;of us are sleepless princesses, now, prickled by anxiety and text messages, by lights and to-do lists and rubbish on the internet; and right, too,&nbsp;that the intersection of the new science of the brain and our myths about sleep is a&nbsp;fascinating area. But the notion that sleep is&nbsp;an Edenic, universal, good which we&nbsp;have only recently lost through our&nbsp;capitalistic sins – really, what princesses are we, to&nbsp;have thought up&nbsp;such a pea?</p>","headline":"The Secret Life of Sleep review – personal and politicised reflections","trailText":"<p>Is it time to throw your alarm clock away?

Welcome to the 'overwhelm'. Brigid Schulte's book is a prescription for treating our doing-too-much culture","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>In 1930, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-maynard-keynes\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a> predicted that within a century, we would work only 15 hours a week. Just over two decades later, a fresh-faced vice-president called Richard Nixon volunteered that, by 1990, Americans would retire at the age of 38. And yet somehow, despite all the gadgets and gizmos that were supposed to set us free from drudgery – dishwashers, disposable nappies, Skype – many people in the developed world now feel they are working harder than ever.</p><p>Brigid Schulte (pictured) calls this \"the overwhelm\". The Washington Post reporter's engaging book – which is by turns a pop science explainer, self-help guide and subtle feminist polemic – aims to discover why some of us feel there simply aren't enough hours in the day. She sympathises: juggling family and career, and feeling guilty about neglecting both, she is \"scattered, fragmented, exhausted\". Not only is she doing too much – she feels she should always be doing more.</p><p>It is a common sentiment, particularly among working mothers; I&nbsp;recently sat in a room full of high-profile women in the media, discussing how they made it to the top. The answer, again and again: working part-time when their children were young, and in one case, having a stay-at-home husband. They were proof you couldn't \"have it all\", if&nbsp;that meant working 60 hours a week while raising a young family. \"With work, if it had been all or nothing, I&nbsp;would have chosen nothing,\" one said.</p><p>That is Schulte's diagnosis, too: by far the most leisure-time-starved group in society are mothers (particularly single mothers). It took decades for researchers to realise this, because they initially regarded childcare and housework as leisure time (most were men). This isn't a book that hammers you with its feminist credentials, but there is an&nbsp;unavoidably gendered aspect to our ideas of what constitutes \"real work\", even though you'd be hard-pressed to argue that a screaming toddler is the easy option compared with piddling round on Microsoft Excel.</p><p>But even as an increasing number of&nbsp;women work full-time outside the home, our attachment to traditional gender roles is hard to shake. Mothers still do far more housework and childcare than fathers, even when both&nbsp;parents work – and dads' time with their kids is often in the company of their partner, making them the \"helping\" parent, or the \"fun\" parent. Mums get to be the \"supervisory parent\", and therefore can't ever really relax. (In gay&nbsp;couples, the roles are much more likely to be equitably shared.) Such women experience free time in tiny gobbets, all the while hoping there isn't anything important in their stack of unread emails, and that odd smell isn't cat sick under the stairs again.</p><p>Fighting \"the overwhelm\" means identifying the problem, and there are three villains in this book: our jobs, our&nbsp;expectations and ourselves. Give a&nbsp;small cheer here if you live in Europe, because it turns out that America really, really hates its citizens and wants them to be unhappy. \"The US is&nbsp;the only advanced economy that doesn't guarantee workers paid time off,\" Schulte writes. \"Nearly one-quarter of all American workers get no paid vacation, most of them low-wage and part-time workers.\" Oh, and don't expect any paid maternity leave either; there is no legal requirement to offer it. All this is a legacy of the religious right's dominance in the 1970s, when firebrands such as <a href=\"http://buchanan.org/blog/\" title=\"\">Pat Buchanan</a> decided that nurseries were probably a plot to indoctrinate children and make them into tiny commies. Schulte gazes longingly towards Scandinavia, with its family-friendly policies, but the US situation sounds so bad I even felt a&nbsp;twang of pride for Blighty.</p><p>The next cause of the overwhelm is&nbsp;a construct Schulte calls the \"ideal worker\". The ideal worker is&nbsp;the perfect capitalist machine-part, never seizing up or breaking down, always ready for overtime or foreign travel, never missing a day to look after a sick child or parent. Many businesses are in the grip of \"presenteeism\", imagining that there is a&nbsp;perfect correlation between time spent with&nbsp;bum on office chair and productivity. There isn't: research shows most people can only do eight hours of quality work a day. After that, they are just desk meat, surreptitiously playing Solitaire in a&nbsp;browser window or daydreaming about dinner. A macho long-hours culture hurts men just as much as women: when new dads ask for flexible working, they get burned both by the assumption they are not dedicated to the job and the assumption they are big old Girlie Men.</p><p>We can't blame everything on heartless employers, though. The relatively affluent have to take some responsibility for worshipping at the Altar of Overwork, an attitude Schulte calls \"busier than thou\". Just as having a tan became a status symbol once it denoted that you could afford foreign holidays, so being overwhelmed is a&nbsp;badge of honour for middle-class professionals. Oh, between Jonny's clarinet lessons and my Mandarin classes and Steve getting promoted to partner, I&nbsp;don't have a minute to myself, they trill. Having no free time makes the point you don't just have a&nbsp;job. You have a&nbsp;career. You&nbsp;are Going Somewhere.</p><p>Schulte's prescription is simple: decide whether you love the bragging rights of being busy enough to live in a&nbsp;debilitating whirlwind of activity. If&nbsp;you don't, perhaps leave the clarinet unmolested and the boxercise class undone. As for housework, one researcher's message to women is refreshingly simple: be a slattern. \"Do&nbsp;you have to be able to do open-heart surgery on the kitchen floor?\" he&nbsp;asks. Also, make sure Himself pulls his weight.</p><p>This book's strength is mixing research and anecdote in a lively, accessible way, with a reporter's eye for&nbsp;detail. I underlined a passage about&nbsp;\"establishing metrics to measure success and feedback loops to course-correct\" to remind me just how refreshingly little hand-wavy mumbo-jumbo there is elsewhere. The obvious criticism is that Schulte's message speaks largely to uptight overachievers in creative fields, and being told to lobby for a four-day week or a 4pm hometime won't cut much ice if you are on the minimum wage or a zero-hours contract. (The author does acknowledge that the figure for average working hours is misleading because it obscures the gulf between the crazy-busy top of the labour market and the underemployed bottom, yet is&nbsp;otherwise prone to breezy generalisations.) But, of course, a book like this can't hope to tackle every aspect of&nbsp;such a complex subject, and even if it did, no one would have time to read the result. There just aren't enough hours in the day.</p>","headline":"Overwhelmed: Work, Love and Play When No One Has the Time – review","trailText":"<p>Too busy? Welcome to the 'overwhelm'.

There is no obvious reason why the evolution of this crowded, traumatised, violent metropolis in India in the early decades of the 21st century should follow that of New York, London or Paris in another place and another time. Delhi will remain as it is.</p><p>Judging by the content of the previous pages, this is a frightening prospect. Dasgupta has provided a welcome corrective to the reams of superficial travel writing describing the whimsical, the exotic, the booming or simply the poverty-stricken in India. His is a much more complex, darker story and it is no surprise that his book is peopled by the corrupt, the tragic and the terrified.</p><p>Dasgupta was born and raised in the UK and his work thus fits in a long tradition of nonfiction writing on India by outsiders who are also insiders. The idea to take Delhi, and more particularly its new \"bourgeoisie\", as a subject is a very good one. Through an unflinching portrayal of the arrogant, aggressive, ultra-materialistic new wealthy in the Indian capital he makes broad points about India a generation after the major wave of economic reform which unleashed a savage capitalism in the country.</p><p>\"If I do something, I do it for myself, I do it for my family and I do it for my friends… For nobody else,\" says one interviewee, a hugely rich industrialist. Another, the troubled and driven scion of a big business dynasty, talks of the \"contempt\" he thinks he would feel for the workforce, who toil on the construction sites which make his family's fortune. He \"thinks he would feel\" because he has not actually viewed their prison-like accommodation, with its filth, disease, danger and overcrowding. To these people, and many others like them, the poor are invisible, airbrushed out of reality.</p><p>But the book is more than a critique of global capitalism and India's version of it. After all, Dasgupta's talents are as&nbsp;a writer, a chronicler and an observer, not an economist. It is an investigation of the essential violence which underpins all relations in the city, that is the essence of the place.</p><p>Dasgupta traces this back to the destruction in 1947 of the erudite, spiritual, syncretic civilisation that united Muslims and Hindus in the city. There are many earlier traumatic events too – the razing of the city by a series of conquerors over a millennium – but it is the massive violence that accompanied the partition of British India, the exodus of so many Muslims, the influx of huge numbers of scared, stunned, bitter refugees from the Punjab, which defined Delhi's dark soul. This marks, Dasgupta writes, \"the birth of what can be recognised as contemporary Delhi culture. This is why the city seems so emotionally broken… so threatening… The residual trauma, like DDT in the food chain, became more concentrated with time.\" Delhi's obsession with money, property, power and outward display is the \"diametric opposite\" of the detached, spiritual outlook of the city's wealthy before 1947, Dasgupta says. Here, instead of meaning a celebration of community, the word \"communal\" indicates sectarian conflict.</p><p>The emasculation experienced by northern Indian men during partition, when women were subjected to atrocious violence, plays its role in explaining another significant feature of modern Delhi. In one of the bleakest passages in this bleak book, Dasgupta talks of the \"low-level, but widespread, war against women whose new mobility made them not only the icons of India's social and economic changes but also the scapegoats\". Independent women threaten a deeply fragile masculine identity and are punished, often publicly, as a result.</p><p>The gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a bus on Delhi's streets in December 2012 marked an inflection point in the general narrative overseas about the city. The attention it attracted was due in large part to the previous perception of the city as the capital of a country that was \"emerging\", a process which in the west is seen as a uniform and smooth ascent of hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>But change generates enormous tensions which often lead to great violence. This is true right across south Asia. If major conflicts alive at the end of the last century such as those in Nepal, Kashmir or Sri Lanka have cooled, many others, at a lower level, have sprung up. These include anti-Muslim attacks in Myanmar, gang wars in the tiny island nation of the Maldives, the lethal street politics of Bangladesh, the criminals who kill in Pakistan's Karachi, Islamic extremist groups on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, conflicts over land, water, mineral resources, caste and, increasingly, values in India. This is certainly an emerging region in economic terms. But it is also an extremely violent one. This does not contradict the growth story, but it is an inherent part of it.</p><p>Dasgupta's unstated but apparent nostalgia for rural life – a feature of many critiques of the urban from both left and right wing – sometimes jars. There is nothing particularly bucolic about India's villages, and urbanisation combined with industrialisation is almost certainly the only way that sufficient wealth can be generated for future generations to enjoy a better life. It is simply not the case that most people in India are worse off now than 20 or 30 years ago, as a glance at figures for literacy, life expectancy, maternal mortality and so on makes clear. Gains are grossly unequal, but real.</p><p>Perhaps this is clutching at straws. Dasgupta may well think so. His final warning is that Delhi, as it is not as it might be, is the future, and not just of India's cities but of hundreds of others across the planet.</p>","headline":"Capital review – Rana Dasgupta's perceptive exploration of modern Delhi","trailText":"<p>Rana Dasgupta's powerful study suggests the savage realities of modern-day Delhi will not be changing any time soon, writes <strong>Jason Burke</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395060980921/capital-delhi-review-rana-006.jpg","wordcount":"981","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-24T22:59:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/capital-review-rana-dasgupta-modern-delhi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/23/capital-review-rana-dasgupta-modern-delhi","tags":[{"id":"books/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/society","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/society","references":[]},{"id":"world/delhi","webTitle":"Delhi (News)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/delhi","references":[]},{"id":"cities/cities","webTitle":"Cities","type":"keyword","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/cities","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/cities/cities","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/india","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jasonburke","webTitle":"Jason Burke","rcsId":"GNL001549","r2ContributorId":"15798","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/2/1267538178716/Jason-Burke.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jason Burke is the south Asia correspondent of the Guardian and the Observer newspapers.</p><p>In more than a decade as a staff correspondent with the papers, Burke has reported on a wide range of subjects in countries from Algeria to Cambodia, from Uzebkistan to Zimbabwe. </p><p>Based in Pakistan from 1998 to 2002,  reporting from Afghanistan under the Taliban and during the war of 2001, he has returned to Pakistan and Afghanistan many times since.

Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs) would roll out on patrol into, say, Fallujah and when they hit a bomb – \"32,000lb of steel lifting and buckling into the air\" –&nbsp;the immediate fear of the&nbsp;survivors was that this would be followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of explosions from mines laid to have&nbsp;maximum impact on anyone approaching or escaping the initial carnage. The image stuck in my&nbsp;mind because that's what this collection of short stories is: a daisy chain of incendiary fictional accounts of frontline military experience in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, carefully deployed to detonate in the reader's mind one after another.</p><p>Phil Klay is an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/phil-klay-desire-serve-my-country-us-marine\" title=\"\">ex-marine who served in Iraq</a>. But, in the present context, this is not what distinguishes him: what matters is that he is also a scrupulous and skilful writer. And <em>Redeployment</em> is the real thing – a vivid and vital battery of war stories that does not rely solely&nbsp;on its subject matter for impact (although, make no mistake, the subject certainly has impact).</p><p>I must admit, though, I struggled with the first few pages. I can't stand&nbsp;the clear-as-a-mountain-creek regular‑guy style so beloved of the faux-masculine tough-but-vulnerable narrative. And for a page or two, <em>Redeployment</em> read to me as if it was&nbsp;written by a rogue Jack Daniels copywriter: \"It was good. We got back on the plane and passed the fuck out. Woke up in America.\" Lots of \"roger\" this and \"roger\" that, and sentences like, \"Sweat a little of the alcohol out,&nbsp;too.\" Here we go, I thought, 300&nbsp;pages&nbsp;from some poor, screwed-up acronym‑spewing marine who finds himself intellectually embarrassed to discover&nbsp;that human beings have rich, deep and dark inner lives. Read <em>War and Peace</em>, soldier.</p><p>I was wrong. This was but a single voice. And, as I read on through the collection, the opening title story revealed itself not to be a sign of&nbsp;limitation but of the book's range. For&nbsp;it is definitely in the combined effect of&nbsp;the&nbsp;stories that <em>Redeployment</em> garners its power and earns the comparisons to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/specials/obrien-vietnam.html\" title=\"\">Tim O'Brien's writing on Vietnam</a> that it has been getting in America. Indeed, Klay's gifts become more apparent with each new narrator and circumstance: his reach, his tonal&nbsp;control, his observational sophistication, the sheer emotional torque of his narratives. By the end, he&nbsp;had convincingly inhabited more than a dozen different voices and I felt I had learned more about Iraq than in any documentary or factual account.</p><p>In my favourite piece, \"Prayer in the Furnace\", a self-examining chaplain berates himself for daring to suggest that some good would come of suffering. He finds himself \"disgusting\" and \"vile\". He receives a&nbsp;startlingly beautiful letter from his mentor and writes a sermon citing Wilfred Owen. He is compassionate, despairing, desperate, resolved, courageous, cowardly, a foolhardy failure and a dogged success of a man, all at the same time. Not easy to achieve in 38 pages.</p><p>In \"Money as a Weapons System\", which reminded me of Joseph Heller's <em>Catch-22</em>, we witness a brilliantly cast&nbsp;Provincial Reconstruction Team struggle to make sense of the chaos. At&nbsp;great risk to all, the protagonist drives out to a water treatment plant – dark, rusted, locked – trying to locate Kazemi, the chief engineer. Eventually, Kazemi turns up and tells them that the Americans have built the wrong pipes which will deliver water at too&nbsp;great a pressure and blow up thousands of Sunni bathrooms; but as a Shi'a, he's loath to turn on the water for Sunnis because he'll be murdered. Nothing happens. Kazemi is killed anyway. Meanwhile, the team are delivered a consignment of baseball uniforms by a millionaire philanthropist, \"the mattress king of northern Kansas\", before they move on to a bee-keeping project with a handful of Iraqi widows.</p><p>Here we have a series of increasingly sophisticated portraits of&nbsp;men pulled apart by competing and&nbsp;contradictory feelings. It's no coincidence that Klay's secondary subject is male sexuality – its isolation, its neediness, its lust, pride, sometime sensitivity, sometime cauterisation. He&nbsp;writes with striking perception and&nbsp;unusual honesty about his soldiers' relationships with wives, girlfriends and lap dancers, as&nbsp;well as the Iraqi girls they see (often&nbsp;through cross hairs). There's some funny stuff – a platoon all get herpes because they're using the same \"pocket pussy\". There's some brutal stuff – an anecdote in the story \"In Vietnam They Had Whores\" that I'll leave you to read. But it is interesting that the horror of war allows Klay to smuggle in an uncustomary male frankness that makes Roth, Amis and&nbsp;the gang look elliptical and effete.</p><p>The thing that impressed me most, though, was Klay's behind-the-scenes skill with language. For the most part, the stories are planed and worked in that meticulous American manner. The&nbsp;dialogue is a lesson in how to render the rhythms of natural speech.

Over 90 volumes written in a mere 20 years: the&nbsp;rate of composition alone is enough to make one feel faint. And, if&nbsp;you have A-level French or better, however rusty it may be, there's the nagging sense that you also ought to be&nbsp;reading them in French ...</p><p>Here is an extremely elegant way around this problem, which will not only provide you with a thorough feeling for the joys of Balzac but will do&nbsp;so without the massive digressions that can clog up the longer works (hag‑ridden by debt, he wrote like a&nbsp;maniac to fend off his creditors, and&nbsp;sometimes you can tell he's channelling the French equivalent of&nbsp;Private Eye's Phil Space in order to&nbsp;get to his daily word-count).</p><p>Here are nine stories and novellas, all nicely translated by Linda Asher, Carol Cosman and Jordan M Stump with only the rare, jarring Americanism (\"Say ...\" for \"<em>mais voilà </em>...\"; forgivable); and a very good introduction by academic Peter Brooks, who writes insightfully and without jargon. The stories feature characters from the <em>Comédie</em> – some of them are,&nbsp;in a sense, a trial run for the larger&nbsp;works; but all are in their way fully achieved.</p><p>Brooks quotes Oscar Wilde: \"the 19th century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac's.\" When Wilde said that, it was one of his great gags with a solid vein of truth in it; now, the&nbsp;truth is even more obvious. Only Dickens can compete on such terms; and if you go by output alone, Balzac blows him away. I would also say that delightful and brilliant though Dickens is, Balzac is quite simply the superior novelist, more on the alert against mawkishness. You can't imagine a&nbsp;Wildeism about Balzac along the lines&nbsp;of only a heart of stone not being moved to laughter by the death of Little Nell. Balzac is, basically, more grown up. You get the sense that you&nbsp;are reading an undeceived, undeceivable adult – albeit one with a&nbsp;highly developed sense of the melodramatic, and the potency of story itself. Many of his stories are enfolded within themselves – narrator passing on the story told by a character he meets, etc – and sometimes I found myself thinking of a large-scale version of the miniaturist Stefan Zweig.</p><p>Again and again, though, Balzac returns, obliquely but obsessively, to&nbsp;the fact of his extraordinary facility for creation; his characters lose themselves in thoughts and imaginings about the lives of people they see in the street. One of his most intriguing and compelling characters, the money-lender Gobseck in the eponymous story, describes himself as you imagine Balzac might: \"Do you think it's nothing, this power to see into the most secret recesses of the human heart, to engage another person's heart, to see it all stripped naked? It&nbsp;is&nbsp;always drama, always different: hideous wounds, deathly sorrows, love scenes, griefs likely to end beneath the waters of the Seine, a young man's pleasures that lead to the scaffold, despairing laughter, and sumptuous celebrations.\" That, essentially, is Balzac's work: never a dull moment, with ruin or scandal always but a step&nbsp;away, lovers declaring that they must love so-and-so or die – and then delivering on that oath. (This occurs in&nbsp;\"Sarrasine\".)</p><p>Balzac was also incredibly influential. Without him, no Proust, no&nbsp;Flaubert, and – who knows? – no&nbsp;realism. He was also one of the novelists who appreciated that, above all, a novel is a means of transport between very different modes of experience. He wanted, in real life, to&nbsp;build a spiral staircase between the&nbsp;Jardin de Luxembourg and the catacombs beneath; and that's a fairly obvious metaphor for how he saw his grand work, as a bridge between the highest and lowest of society. And the&nbsp;great thing about work this entertaining is that it's still exciting nearly 200 years on; so it isn't just a bridge, it's a fully functioning time machine. I strongly recommend you&nbsp;hop in.</p>","headline":"The Human Comedy: Selected Stories by Honoré de Balzac – review","trailText":"<p><strong>Nicholas Lezard's paperback of the week: </strong>Here is an extremely elegant way to experience the joys of Balzac without learning French</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680214565/Honore-de-Balzac-006.jpg","wordcount":"652","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T17:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard","tags":[{"id":"books/fiction-in-translation","webTitle":"Fiction in translation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction-in-translation","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction-in-translation","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard's choice","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholaslezard","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard","rcsId":"GNL034660","r2ContributorId":"16172","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374241286766/Nicholas-Lezard.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicholas Lezard is a literary critic for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaslezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholaslezard","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-433121869","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395680206275/Honore-de-Balzac-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Roger Viollet/Getty Images","photographer":"Lapi","altText":"Honore de Balzac","height":"54","credit":"Lapi/Roger Viollet/Getty Images","caption":"Better than Dickens … Honoré de Balzac.

A new Val McDermid, set at the Edinburgh festival. As it's against the law to write a book about the Edinburgh festival without someone discovering a&nbsp;dead standup comedian bobbing about in the Water of Leith, and as McDermid excels at crime fiction, I was tempted to bolt the door and gobble the book down in one sitting. But this novel is a very different proposition indeed, part of The Austen Project, a&nbsp;series that includes Joanna Trollope's take on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/27/joanna-trollope-sense-sensibility-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>, and promises to bring us <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Curtis Sittenfeld and <em>Emma</em> by Alexander McCall Smith, all&nbsp;with a contemporary setting.</p><p>So instead of reading gothic romance, for example, Catherine Morland reads <em>Twilight</em>; instead of letters brought in by maids, they post on Facebook, and so on. These aren't short stories or exercises in style; they are full-length novels, months of work from busy authors at the top of their game. The book itself is perfectly diverting; it follows the original plot&nbsp;very closely, and it is funny and brilliantly written. People who think of&nbsp;McDermid as a dark, intense writer will have a much lighter, jollier time – anyone who has tried to heave their way to a bar in the Assembly Rooms in&nbsp;August is probably experiencing something similar to a dance at the Bath Pump Rooms in the early 19th century.</p><p>But the real question is, why? Why do it? Who's it for? The world is neck-deep in Austen knock-offs, from the sensational (<em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em>, <em>Clueless</em>) to the lamentable (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1985019/\" title=\"\"><em>Austenland</em></a>). As an author, she has not just been done to death, she has been pounded, repeatedly and continuously, with a stick made out of a dead horse.</p><p>Austen's beautifully observed work had much to say about the marriage market, money, love and their confluence in human emotions. And McDermid echoes it, the message being, presumably, that in the world of&nbsp;practicality versus passionate love – sense and sensibility – nothing ever really changes. But we know this already: from <em>Lost in Austen</em>, from the&nbsp;evergreen Andrew Davies BBC adaptations, from PD James's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/31/death-comes-to-pemberley-pd-james\" title=\"\"><em>Death Comes to Pemberley</em></a>, from every Romantic novelist who ever wrote about a grumpy but, happily, solvent man.</p><p>And simply to take the plot seems peculiar when what makes Austen so great is the voice, the insight, the feeling for humanity (this is doubly true for <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, which may be her funniest novel, but in plot terms isn't the most watertight). Genius is eternal. There is no need to turn a barouche into a Triumph Spitfire. What would make a much more interesting project would be to take an author venerated in their time but difficult to read now; someone should have a shot at Guillaume de Lorris.</p><p>Weirdly, in its incredibly high-stakes world of lifelong mating, and despite its constipated, joke-free prose, <em>Twilight</em> – the novel beloved of McDermid's Catherine Morland – has more in common with Austen than McDermid's book does. There is some delightful social skewering, and McDermid is clearly enjoying herself, but it feels as though there is nothing new to say on the subject – or so you might have thought. It is ironic that this project is happening now, at the same time as a genuinely stark, beautiful and new way of looking at Austen has appeared. That book is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/14/longbourn-carriage-house-austen-review\" title=\"\"><em>Longbourn</em>, by Jo Baker</a>, and I very much commend it to you.</p>","headline":"Northanger Abbey by Val McDermid review – 'Austen for the Facebook age'","trailText":"McDermid's addition to the Jane Austen Project may be funny and beautifully written, but surely it's time to rework a less fashionable author, writes <strong>Jenny Colgan</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395661138682/Val-McDermid-004.jpg","wordcount":"557","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-09T10:36:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/26/northanger-abbey-val-mcdermid-review-austen-facebook-age","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/26/northanger-abbey-val-mcdermid-review-austen-facebook-age","tags":[{"id":"books/janeausten","webTitle":"Jane Austen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/janeausten","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"books/val-mcdermid","webTitle":"Val McDermid","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/val-mcdermid","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/val-mcdermid","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jennycolgan","webTitle":"Jenny Colgan","r2ContributorId":"26661","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/28/1340876245226/JennyColgan2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jenny Colgan is a novelist, journalist and occasional radio pundit.
