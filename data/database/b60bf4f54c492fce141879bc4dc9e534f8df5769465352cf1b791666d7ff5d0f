After she had given birth to 14 children, she made a vow to live chastely with her husband, and embarked on pilgrimages to Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela, Italy and Germany. Her devotion was expressed through loud cries and roars, which often irritated bystanders, but she became famous as a mystic, and claimed to have conversations with God.</p><p>She dictated her life story to a priest, but her autobiography was only known through excerpts printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1501, and by Henry Pepwell, who called her a \"devoute ancres\",  in 1521, until a complete manuscript – thought to be a copy made from the original, possibly under Kempe's supervision – was discovered in a cupboard in the 1930s.</p><p>\"The story goes that when Colonel W Butler Bowdon was looking for a ping-pong bat in a cupboard at his family home near Chesterfield in the early 1930s he came across a pile of old books.&nbsp;Frustrated at the disorder, he threatened to put the whole lot on the bonfire the next day so that bats and balls would be easier to find in future.&nbsp;Luckily a friend advised him to have the books checked by an expert and shortly afterwards Hope Emily Allen identified one as the Book of Margery Kempe,\" said Sarah J Biggs, from the British Library's medieval team.</p><p>Biggs said the memoir, which has just been <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_61823\" title=\"\">digitised by the British Library</a>, was \"perhaps the first autobiography written in English\", and is also \"a remarkable record of the religious life of a woman during the tumultuous 14th and 15th centuries\".</p><p>Kempe refers to herself in her book in the third person as \"this creatur\", opening her story by telling of how after the birth of her first child she became ill and believed herself to be surrounded by devils. Forcibly restrained, she tore at her skin and bit her hand so hard she retained the marks for the rest of her life, before Jesus appeared to her in a vision and she grew calm.</p><p>\"Margery Kempe led an extraordinary life,\" said Biggs, \"and this manuscript is of incredible importance for scholars of this period. &nbsp;Prior to the 1930s this text was only known through 16th-century printed versions, and is the first such manuscript containing her autobiography. We are pleased to be able to make it available worldwide.\"</p><p>The first page of the manuscript states \"Liber Montis Gracie. This boke is of Mountegrace\", with the pages annotated by four scribes, said the British Library, \"probably monks associated with the&nbsp;Carthusian priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire\". Their notes highlight key passages, such as \"nota de clamore\" when Kempe utters her first cry, and \"mirabile\" to mark a miraculous event.</p><p>One of these miracles, said the British Library, occurs when Kempe meets a very learned priest, a \"Dewcheman\" (German) who could not understand what she said, so they had to speak to each other through an interpreter.&nbsp; Kempe advised the priest to pray for 13 days, and at the end of this \"he undirstod what sche seyd in Englysch to hym and sche undirstod what that he seyd. And yet he undirstod not Englisch that other men spokyn\".</p><p>\"A miracle indeed! But for Margery this was not an occasion to celebrate,\" said the library. Instead, \"sche sobbyd boistowsly and cryed ful lowde and horybly\".</p><p>\"One wonders what the learned priest's reaction could have been,\" said Biggs, adding that Kempe had been described by critics as everything from a religious eccentric to a feminist icon, a literary genius and an early social reformer, but that \"however we view her, there is no doubt that the work provides an invaluable insight into 15th-century urban life and into the religious practices of the period.\"</p>","headline":"Margery Kempe, the first English autobiographer, goes online","trailText":"<p>British Library digitises original edition of medieval mystic's 'extraordinary' account of her life</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395320042393/Margery-Kempes-autobiogra-007.jpg","wordcount":"657","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T12:36:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/margery-kempe-first-autobiographer-digitised-british-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/margery-kempe-first-autobiographer-digitised-british-library","tags":[{"id":"books/british-library","webTitle":"British Library","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/british-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/british-library","references":[]},{"id":"books/libraries","webTitle":"Libraries","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/libraries","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/libraries","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","webTitle":"Religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432585139","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395320036543/Margery-Kempes-autobiogra-003.jpg","typeData":{"source":"British Library","altText":"Margery Kempe's autobiography","height":"923","credit":"British Library","caption":"'Incredible importance' … a page from Margery Kempe's autobiography.

In <a href=\"http://www.tamarindbooks.co.uk/downloads/tamarind_righttobeseen.pdf\" title=\"\">a 2008 lecture</a>, she explained that she was moved to launch the publisher when her son came home from school with a booklet, on which he had coloured a picture of himself in pink. She offered him a brown crayon to fix it. \"It has to be that colour. It's for a book!\" he told her.\"I had no choice. I had to become a publisher,\" said Wilkins.</p><p></p><p>Today, Tamarind is part of Penguin Random House, and picture book editor Joe Marriott said that \"there's still work to be done\" in terms of diversity in children's books.</p><p></p><p>\"On the Tamarind list we actively look for inclusive stories with characters from varied cultural backgrounds and we've published some wonderful books over the years, both picture books such as The Silence Seeker or Mum's Late, and more recently books for older children such as Jamila Gavin's Blackberry Blue or Crystal Chan's debut Bird,\" he said, adding that in the company more widely, \"half of the debut novels we're publishing this year feature black, Asian or mixed-race main characters\", from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/15/running-girl-garvie-smith-mystery-simon-mason\" title=\"\">Simon Mason's Running Girl</a>, which has a black teenage boy protagonist, to My Mummy is Magic, \"a lovely picture book for Mother's Day which just happens to depict a mixed-race family\".</p><p></p><p>\"In each of these titles, the diversity is unselfconscious. It is so important for all children to feel represented in the books they read, in a way that doesn't feel forced or as though ethnicities are pigeonholed – publishing and promoting inclusive books is something to which we're utterly committed,\" said Marriott.</p><p></p><p>Cox agreed, stressing the importance of increasing \"the number of books relevant to cultural and racial diversity, including positive representation of Asian as well as black families\".</p><p></p><p>\"All children have the right to be included in books, to see faces that they can relate to on the covers, to meet characters with similar families, lives and experiences, and that is one of the reasons that we established Inclusive Minds. &nbsp;Equally important is for children to see&nbsp;difference in books, to learn about those who are different from themselves, and to realise that they do, in fact, have many similarities,\" said Cox.</p><p></p><p>\"Discussions about diversity in books&nbsp;are often focused exclusively on&nbsp;cultural or racial diversity, but we believe it's important to&nbsp;address&nbsp;all areas of diversity as there are so many children who aren't able to find themselves in books. Publishers are starting to become aware of this, but unfortunately stereotypes are still perpetuated, and inclusion is often forced. Our aim is to work with the publishers in order to help them develop fully-rounded characters and to make their books naturally inclusive.\"</p>","headline":"Diversity in children's books: colouring in required","trailText":"There are growing calls for young people's reading to broaden its picture of society from what is currently a depressingly monochrome view","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395314847904/Young-black-boy-007.jpg","wordcount":"858","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T11:19:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/diversity-children-books-colour-young-people","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/diversity-children-books-colour-young-people","tags":[{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/publishing","webTitle":"Publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/race","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/race","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432560058","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395314839433/Young-black-boy-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Alamy","altText":"Young black boy","height":"130","credit":"Alamy","caption":"Unwelcoming view … a young black boy reading.

Sam Leith tucks in to Mina Holland's companionable guide to global gastronomy","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Here is a nice idea for a cookery book, amiably executed and attractively plated up. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mina-holland\" title=\"\">Mina Holland</a> has produced what you'd hesitate to call a&nbsp;whistle-stop tour – perhaps the metaphor should be a dim sum or tapas-style feast – of a number of the world's different cuisines. She is interested in how these styles of cooking draw on local ingredients and&nbsp;traditions, they way they sit in the&nbsp;culture and, above all, the way in which they have cross-fertilised with other food cultures. \"Food typifies everything that is different about another culture and gives the most authentic insight into how people live,\" she writes on the first page of her&nbsp;introduction, which is a bit of an overstatement but gives a flavour of the project.</p><p>Necessarily, depth is sacrificed for&nbsp;breadth. But breadth has its advantages. The text is interspersed with cute graphics – charts, tables, maps – that allow you to compare and&nbsp;contrast: a table showing, say, the different ingredients that go into the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/mirepoix\" title=\"\">mirepoix</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/05/chicken-sofrito-smoked-corn-recipes\" title=\"\">sofrito</a> of various cooking cultures; a simplified map of the spice routes; a table of different chillis; a graphic of the Americas showing how influences (and ingredients) poured in from all sides like troops advancing on a battlefield map.</p><p>Her regions are Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and the Americas. No&nbsp;prawns on the barbie, then. Europe gets the most attention: she looks at four cuisines for each of France (Normandy, Loire Valley, Lyon and Provence) and Spain (Catalonia, northern Spain, central Spain and Andalucia) and five for Italy (Lazio, Emilia-Romagna, Calabria, Sicily, Veneto). China is represented by only Cantonese and Sichuanese cooking, and the whole of Africa gets only three: Ethiopia, west Africa and Morocco (which overlaps a bit with the Middle East in any case). Still, it's unreasonable to expect this book to be able to offer much more than what its author endearingly describes as \"a scant slice of a deep and&nbsp;nuanced pie\".</p><p>Digging about in this deep and nuanced pie (may all our pies be deep&nbsp;and nuanced!), Holland is a resoundingly enthusiastic guide. She always has a kind word for the meekest of ingredients – \"the humble sesame seed\", \"the humble soybean\" and even \"the humble lettuce leaf\". Most of the chapters come enhanced with quotes from an expert in the cuisine – either a&nbsp;local, a food writer or a restaurateur; and with an epigraph from a literary production of some sort. That rounds it&nbsp;out pleasantly. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jhumpa-lahiri\" title=\"\">Jhumpa Lahiri</a> is quoted in the section on northern India; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/arundhatiroy\" title=\"\">Arundhati Roy</a> on the south. Korea brings forth references to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/psy\" title=\"\">Psy</a> and <a href=\"http://nothingtoenvy.com/\" title=\"\">Barbara Demick</a>. On German sausages Holland quotes an excellent HL Mencken passage: \"They run in size from little fellows so small and pale and fragile that it seems a crime to eat&nbsp;them, to vast and formidable pieces that look like shells for heavy artillery. And they run in flavour from the most delicate to the most raucous, and in texture from that of feathers caught in&nbsp;a cobweb to that of linoleum.\"</p><p>When we're in Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/orhanpamuk\" title=\"\">Orhan Pamuk</a>'s remark that \"colour is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a&nbsp;word out of the darkness\" sparks a little cadenza on Istanbul's \"wonderful racket of visual splendour … the breathtaking interior of the Blue Mosque, the Bosphorus shimmering at&nbsp;sunset and the coloured glass lamps that create multi-hued silhouettes on the walls of the Grand Bazaar … the mountains of dried fruits and nuts, and piles of brightly coloured spice dusts\".</p><p>Where she's visited, or even lived in, the places she's writing about, Holland puts in welcome splashes of autobiographical colour – though she stops short of giving us a chapter on the distinctive cuisine of Streatham. Some&nbsp;of these recipes are her family's. As a&nbsp;young woman in Madrid, she says, she was thwarted only in being unable to find \"good hummus and my bra size\"; we meet her friend Sophie, \"haunted by artichokes as a&nbsp;teenager\"; hear of an 11-day bike trip&nbsp;from London to Berlin (\"a mad undertaking but we did it\"); recall her arrival in California with \"one suitcase and a volume of Joan Didion's collected writing\" meet the sweary grandpa who retired to Thailand; and so on.</p><p>Intriguing little facts are scattered hither and yon. I didn't know, for instance, that yoghurt was a Turkish invention, about the travels of salt cod,&nbsp;the Iranian/Indian biriani/pilau connection, or about the contested etymology of the Vietnamese soup pho&nbsp;(possibly from the French <em>pot au feu</em>). I&nbsp;enjoyed the whimsical taxonomy of chillis – \"names that could be members of a drug cartel: guajillo, piquin, cascabel, pasilla, anch, mulato, habanero, jalapeno and chipotle\" – and the scholarly footnote on films about noodles: in addition to 2006's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780167/\" title=\"\"><em>Udon</em></a>, \"other movies with noodle-based narratives include 2008's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0806165/\" title=\"\"><em>The Ramen Girl</em></a>, in which Brittany Murphy trains to become a ramen chef, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80951/tampopo\" title=\"\"><em>Tampopo</em></a> (1985), set in a family-run noodle shop and dubbed the first 'ramen western'\".</p><p>Holland is also prepared to admit that some of the things people eat will&nbsp;sound pretty fricking disgusting to&nbsp;those of us who don't have the omnivorousness of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/anthonybourdain\" title=\"\">Anthony Bourdain</a>. \"Pajata,\" she admits in her chapter on Lazio, \"is not for the faint hearted; resembling a cheese sausage, this is an unweaned calf's intestine filled with milk chyme (its mother's milk, undigested)\". Jeepers. Can't say Korea's soondae (\"a membrane of pig intestine stuffed with pork blood and cellophane noodles\") appeals much either. Still, we can and should admire those whose appetites are more robust, following the proverbial Cantonese principle that \"anything that walks, swims, crawls or flies with its back to heaven is edible\".</p><p>To me, the most appealing aspect of&nbsp;the book is its practical emphasis on&nbsp;cooking these cuisines at home. There are recipes for two or three representative dishes, usually simple and almost always delicious-sounding, at the end of each chapter. For each cuisine Holland supplies a \"larder list\" of key ingredients that stands as an&nbsp;almost poetic shorthand for the flavours. Germany, for instance, asks&nbsp;for: \"Cabbage (red and white), sausages, potatoes, wild mushrooms, rye and pumpernickel breads, mustard, horseradish, caraway, chives, thyme, juniper berries, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon and clove for puddings.\" Holland even gives you, at the beginning, a list of essential kitchen equipment. It's probably not vital to be advised that a&nbsp;corkscrew and a kitchen radio are nice to have, but it's companionable.</p><p>Most importantly, <em>The Edible Atlas</em> makes you hungry. The epigraph to one chapter is a Japanese proverb: \"I'd rather have dumplings than flowers.\" Me too.</p>","headline":"The Edible Atlas: Around the World in 39 Cuisines – review","trailText":"<p>Fancy a bite of pajata or soondae? <strong>Sam Leith</strong> tucks in to Mina Holland's companionable guide to global gastronomy</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395245214729/apple-pie-004.jpg","wordcount":"1061","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-02T14:58:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/edible-atlas-around-world-cuisines-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/edible-atlas-around-world-cuisines-review","tags":[{"id":"books/food","webTitle":"Food and drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/food","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/food","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/travel-writing","webTitle":"Travel writing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/travel-writing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/travel-writing","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sam-leith","webTitle":"Sam Leith","r2ContributorId":"30236","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/01/20/sam_leith_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Leith the author of You Talkin' To Me?: Rhetoric from Aristotle to Obama (Profile Books)</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-leith","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sam-leith","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432570791","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395245206246/apple-pie-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Felicity Cloake","altText":"apple pie","height":"130","credit":"Felicity Cloake/Guardian","caption":"'May all your pies be deep and nuanced'.

For me, it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/fiction.reviews3\" title=\"\">Carter Beats the Devil by Glen David Gold</a>. I first read it years ago – it came out in 2001 – and I totally adore this story of the magician Charles Carter, which opens on 3 August 1923, the morning after the death of<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding\" title=\"\"> President Harding</a>, who took part in Carter's act shortly before he died.</p><p></p><p>\"Because the coroner's office could not explain exactly how Harding had died, and rumours were already starting, the men from Hearst wanted quite desperately to confirm what happened in the finale, when Carter beat the Devil,\" Gold writes. \"That afternoon, a reporter disguised himself as a delivery man and interrupted Carter's close-up practice; the magician's more sardonic tendencies, unfortunately, came out. 'At the time the president met his maker, I was in a straightjacket, upside over a steaming pit of carbonic acid. In response to your as-yet-unasked query, yes, I do have an alibi.'\"</p><p></p><p>It is wonderful; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/fiction.reviews3\" title=\"\">Peter Preston calls it</a> \"a book – a first novel, no less – to blow you away. It seeks to stun and amaze and deceive and, always, to entertain; and it seldom misses a trick in 600 pulsating pages.\"</p><p>Anyway – that's my underrated book. And you all should read it, if you haven't. I'm telling you about it because Entertainment Weekly has asked a handful of authors – Stephen King, George RR Martin, etc – for <a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/\" title=\"\">their own choices </a> of underrated titles, and I always rather like seeing what I might be missing out on.</p><p><a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/2014/03/18/stephen-king-criminally-underrated-books/#more-23882\" title=\"\">King goes for </a>The Double by George Pelecanos, Headhunters by Jo Nesbo (he calls it \"hilarious and creepy too\"), and, intriguingly, Germinal by Émile Zola, \"a terrific novel of a labor strike, as fresh now as it was a hundred years ago\", he says.</p><p></p><p>GRRM highlights the Accursed Kings series by Maurice Druon – \"All the good stuff that's in my books, minus the fantasy … but it actually happened\" – and Jack Vance's wonderful fantasy novels. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/05/fantasy-tales-dying-earth-jack-vance\" title=\"\">I love Vance too</a>; Martin<a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/2014/03/18/george-rr-martin-criminally-underrated/\" title=\"\"> tells us that </a>\"his Dying Earth stories are classics of the genre, and by rights should be as well-known and widely–read as Tolkien and Howard\".</p><p></p><p>Indeed. How can you not be tempted by his far future Earth, \"a dim place, ancient beyond knowledge. Once it was a tall world of cloudy mountains and bright rivers, and the sun was a white blazing ball. Ages of rain and wind have beaten and rounded the granite, and the sun is feeble and red. The continents have sunk and risen. A million cities have lifted towers, have fallen to dust.

I put on my £20 Nike wicking-fabric T-shirt and my £25 Nike wicking-fabric leggings, then my £25 compression socks and my £110 Brooks Ghost 6 shoes. I strapped on my&nbsp;£100 Garmin Forerunner 210 GPS watch, and zipped up my £40 Saucony high-vis orange windproof jacket. I inserted my iPhone into my armband, plugged in the headphones, then opened the door of my house in north Leeds and headed up Harrogate Road. I&nbsp;checked my watch every so often to see if I was keeping to my marathon pace; I stuck to the roads; and by doing what I was doing and wearing what I was wearing, I symbolised something that Richard Askwith doesn't much like. He calls it \"Big Running\", and he means the industrialisation of an activity that should be free and natural. \"How can running be an industry at all?\" he wonders early on. \"There's no more need for a running industry than there is for a tree-climbing industry or a hide-and-seek industry.\"</p><p>He strengthens this with some impressive numbers: a low-end estimate of the value of the UK's running retail industry is £425m, and globally, running is worth twice as much as football. Twice as many people work in the sports industry in England as in agriculture, forestry and fishery combined. So what? Sport is good. But&nbsp;Askwith successfully skewers the excesses of Big Running, the people in&nbsp;the sports industry who&nbsp;get runners to fall for products by sprinkling them with technobabble fairydust, such as \"stability cradle\" or \"motion control\" or \"over-pronation\". Soon, we meet a&nbsp;human version of Big&nbsp;Running: a man he sees on an&nbsp;evening run in the Peak District. Askwith has set off with no plan and no&nbsp;clue. He has run through holloways and ancient paths, and had a&nbsp;thoroughly enjoyable time. Then he&nbsp;sees a man in Day-Glo colours, grimacing in front of a&nbsp;post marked Trailblaze. And off his imagination runs, too: the other runner&nbsp;is the anti-runner, inserting his&nbsp;data into a device marketed by&nbsp;Trailblaze, a company that has since&nbsp;foundered, but whose legacy remains&nbsp;in every app and website that encourages you to share&nbsp;your latest 5K&nbsp;time, and lose yet&nbsp;more Twitter followers sick of your&nbsp;running updates.</p><p>So Big Runner is on one side, and Askwith on the other. But it wasn't always the case, as he demonstrates with his concept of the Seven Ages of&nbsp;Running. As an unfit and somewhat feckless young man, he went for a run and that was it. In the Second Age of Running, he became a pavement-pounding zealot, and in the Third, he&nbsp;chased peak performances. Pavement-pounders get short shrift: they are \"conventional road-runners\", who seem to have sacrificed enjoyment for personal bests and interval splits. Askwith ran the roads and came out the other end, and decided next to&nbsp;volunteer to be chased by bloodhounds, supervised by the pleasingly taciturn kennel-handler Graham. After&nbsp;the dogs, he turned to the fells and&nbsp;their fell‑runners, his Fourth Age of Running and the subject of his last book <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/feet-in-the-clouds-by-richard-askwith-50932.html\" title=\"\"><em>Feet in the Clouds</em></a>, voted – at least by my running club – one of the best running books ever written.</p><p>I've read a few, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/29/talk-about-running-haruki-murakami\" title=\"\">Murakami</a> to&nbsp;the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/17/running-mark-rowlands-alexandra-heminsley-review\" title=\"\"><em>Running Like a Girl</em> by Alexandra Heminsley</a>. They all have the same problem: they run their course before the end. I began to wonder whether it is possible to write interestingly about something that is, after all, just putting one foot in front of the other, at a speed of your choice. What is compelling about running is what goes on along with it: inside or outside your head. The best writers about it are writing about something else: about being alive, in Askwith's case, in predawn darkness in a Northamptonshire field; about being at&nbsp;peace with freezing rain and puddles and mud and bogs, rather than scared of them, and rather than putting up a barrier of weatherproof, waterproof health and safety against them. This is the Fifth Age of Running, though by now I've lost track. It's also what he calls Slow Running, although it's nothing to do with pace and everything to do with quality, as Slow Food is about valuing ingredients. In Slow Running, the ingredients are the outside world, and the runner's focus turns from digital numbers and Big Running kit to muntjacs and mice; to&nbsp;the ghosts of night-time animals; to&nbsp;exactly how the wind is blowing.</p><p>Askwith knows what he is doing and&nbsp;what he sounds like. He refers to his own \"sneering\". He realises that not everyone can live in a village with easy&nbsp;access to the kind of countryside he has outside his door. And he experiments with Big Running by taking part in one of the wildly popular&nbsp;obstacle races – Tough Mudder, Spartan Warrior, Warrior Dash&nbsp;– that are earning around £18m a year by appealing to people who want to spend a few hours crawling through mud and being electrocuted. I agree with him that obstacle races are rather daft: I can get my kicks from my local woods easily enough and for less than a £100 entry fee. But I see why they are popular, and so does Askwith: they are&nbsp;safe danger in an era of sanitised, risk-free lifestyles. Also, they do look like fun. I'm less lured by&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/century-old-tradition-still-going-strong-1.114159\" title=\"\">Trevelyan manhunt</a>, which Askwith also tries out. This is a secret running event in which men and women are hunted by other men and women, across the Scottish highlands. There is, I guess, a&nbsp;primal purity to it.</p><p>I may have fallen for Big Running, but Askwith's distaste for it is valid, as&nbsp;anyone who runs 20 miles then listens to people start comparing PBs, rather than exult in the power of their legs, or&nbsp;rave about the scenery, must surely agree. He offers a reminder that the simple act of&nbsp;running can return us simply but forcefully to a natural world which is just outside the door. And it doesn't matter where the door is, because this book about running is really about waking up: of a morning, but also our senses, dulled by modern cossetting. Hence the lyrical and tactile&nbsp;descriptions of his morning runs&nbsp;with his dog, carefully skirting cattle and zigzagging through sheep, in&nbsp;his one concession to fancy kit, the bizarre footwear <a href=\"http://www.vibrams.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Vibram Five Fingers</a> –&nbsp;shoes with individual toes his children call \"froggy feet\". He wants us&nbsp;to notice the small, strange or beautiful things: a&nbsp;pile of rodent bones left by some animal hunter overnight; the unexpected pleasure of running in gales, in rain, in freezing cold (tip: run frozen fingers under cold water first, unless you want chilblains). When did humans start being scared of weather? Why must rain be escaped rather than enjoyed? Even with my Big Running gear and my Big Running habits, I finished Askwith's book feeling an urgent need to run up the nearest fell, with no watch and no plan. Just me and my whistle, running free.</p>","headline":"Running Free: A Runner's Journey Back to Nature – review","trailText":"<p>Richard Askwith offers up the case against Big Running: focus on the great outdoors not the fancy footwear.

the earliest printed map of Australia, a \"magnificent\" private library detailing the history of British exploration from the 16th century to the 1930s is set to go up for auction later this month.</p><p>Running to 1,500 books, including the luridly titled Victorian books Slave-catching in the Indian Ocean, Man-hunting in the Desert and Tramps in Dark Mongolia – not to mention the forgotten histories of British explorers such as John Franklin, who died with 129 crew members searching for the north-west passage in 1845 – the collection has been compiled over the past 45 years by Franklin Brooke-Hitching.</p><p>Sotheby's described it as \"the most magnificent collection of books charting the discovery of the world ever to emerge on the market\", and predicted it would fetch more than £5m. Highlights include a book containing specimens of cloth collected by James Cook in the Pacific, and Ernest Shackleton's Aurora Australis, \"printed at the sign of the Penguins\", the winter quarters of the British Antarctic expedition, in 1909. Members of the expedition took a printing press with them to stave off boredom during the perpetual dark of the Antarctic winter; the books were bound in wooden boards from food provision crates, while spines were made from leather horse harnesses. It is estimated that Brooke-Hitching's example, made from a tea chest and one of about 100 printed, will fetch up to £40,000.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432507398'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/3/19/1395247948479/Daniel-Beeckman-orangutan-009.jpg' alt='Daniel Beeckman orangutan illustration' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An Indonesian orang-utan … from Daniel Beeckman's account of his trip to Borneo. Photograph: Sotheby's</figcaption></figure><p>The collection, which will be sold in a series of four auctions starting on 27 March, also features first editions by Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, Cook, Darwin, Scott and Shackleton, as well as the 1772 chart of the Pacific Ocean commissioned by botanist Joseph Banks. The chart, known as the earliest printed map of Australia, is one of only three known to have survived.</p><p>\"This sale represents an opportunity for collectors which may never be repeated,\" said Roger Griffiths, head of Sotheby's books and manuscripts department. \"Over 40 years, Franklin Brooke-Hitching has assembled the finest private collection of books relating to exploration and discovery.\"</p><p>Covering stories of exploration from Sir Humphrey Gilbert, the Elizabethan courtier who in 1583 tried to establish the first colony in the New World, to Daniel Beeckman, who in the early 18th century became the first European to discover orangutans in Borneo, the collection delves into \"all corners of the globe\", said Sotheby's.</p><p>With an estimated worth of £10-15,000, the first book printed in Alaska is also included, the Polar Almanac for the Year of our Lord 1854. It was produced on board the HMS Enterprise while anchored in Camden Bay, as it searched for Franklin and the doomed crew of HMS Terror.</p><p>\"Together they tell the story of mankind's persistent quest – over half a millennium – to discover, explore and understand the world. Many of the books are unique or very rare presentation copies from the authors, or in fine bindings, and all are notable for being in the finest condition imaginable,\" said Griffiths.</p>","headline":"Sotheby's to auction unique collection charting history of British exploration","trailText":"<p>Private library including first editions by Drake, Raleigh and other discoverers expected to go under hammer for over £5m</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/3/19/1395247941846/Daniel-Beeckman-orangutan-004.jpg","wordcount":"490","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-26T15:40:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/sothebys-auction-british-exploration-books-drake-raleigh-franklin-brooke-hitching","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/sothebys-auction-british-exploration-books-drake-raleigh-franklin-brooke-hitching","tags":[{"id":"books/travel-writing","webTitle":"Travel writing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/travel-writing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/travel-writing","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432507395","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/3/19/1395247937111/Daniel-Beeckman-orangutan-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","photographer":"Sotheby's","altText":"Daniel Beeckman orangutan illustration","height":"54","credit":"Sotheby's/PR","caption":"Chimp at the price … an illustration from Daniel Beeckman's account of his trip to Borneo, part of Franklin Brooke-Hitching's collection.

Did no one warn Mrs Cooke to be careful what she wished for? Had she any inkling of the family cataclysm her&nbsp;innocent desire would engender, and the complex repercussions her daughter would suffer in its wake?</p><p>Rewind to the day back in 1970s Indiana, when narrator-heroine Rosemary is separated from her beloved \"twin\" sister, Fern, and sent, aged five, for a week's visit to her grandparents. \"I knew the winds of doom when they blew,\" Rosemary recalls. She senses that she has committed a heinous crime, for which her punishment is expulsion from the bosom of the family. But no. On her return, it is the&nbsp;thrill-seeking Fern who has been dispatched – never to be seen again. There are no explanations.</p><p>Soon afterwards, Rosemary's stormy teenage brother Lowell absconds, also without discussion, leaving her bereft again. When he commits a series of crimes in the name of animal rights and becomes a fugitive from the FBI, a&nbsp;second hole is blasted in the already shaken family. More silence follows and little motormouth Rosemary, recognising a double taboo when she sees one, packs away her enthusiastically learned vocabulary and becomes an almost silent child. In&nbsp;time, she will be left with only a&nbsp;baffling palimpsest of sibling memories, recounted through caustic, guilt-tinged flashbacks. So far, so normal-ish. But \"weird on stilts\" lies just over the horizon.</p><p>There's no way of reviewing this novel without disclosing the shattered Cooke family's not-so-secret secret, deftly held back until page 77: that Rosemary's missing sister, Fern, was a&nbsp;chimpanzee. The girls' imposed \"twin‑sisterhood\" was part of an animal-human behaviour experiment conducted for five years by their psychologist father, before being abruptly terminated.</p><p><em>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</em> resonates with Rosemary's grief for her missing alter ego and sister, and for the adored Lowell, who communicates with the family only through the occasional cryptic postcard. But it's Rosemary's problems as a young adult – informed by her \"simian\" past – that shape the narrative. Who and what is she?</p><p>\"Most home-raised chimps, when asked to sort photographs into piles of&nbsp;chimps and humans, make only the&nbsp;one mistake of putting their own picture into the human pile. This is exactly what Fern did,\" Rosemary recalls. \"What seems not to have been anticipated was my own confusion.\"</p><p>The nickname \"Monkey-girl\" dogs Rosemary's school years, and her deep-rooted identity dysmorphia sets her apart from her fellow students at college, where she is keen to shake off&nbsp;\"the uncanny valley response\" that her&nbsp;off-kilter body language elicits in others. While room-mates swap horror stories about their tamely freakish families, Rosemary knows better than to join in: her own background is a room-silencer.</p><p>But she can't act normal for long. Soon she has hurtled headlong into a dangerous friendship with manic wild-child Harlow, a drama student with Honorary Chimp and Fern Substitute written all over her in giant letters. Drunken capers with a purloined Madame Defarge puppet and a paranoid apartment janitor ensue. For what better way to defy the gravitational pull of psychic pain than to cavort madly beyond its stratosphere?</p><p>In lesser hands, such whirlwind antics might juxtapose oddly with the profound questions the novel raises about animal rights, sibling loyalty, parental subterfuge, self-delusion, guilt and the notion of ownership. But Fowler is neither kooky or didactic: her narrative flits adeptly between registers, mixing pleasure and pain with all the naughty chutzpah of a chimp twizzling a feather duster. And while one family's breakdown, rooted in an act of injustice, forms the bedrock of this astonishing work, the novel's real triumph is that the repercussions of the Cooke parents' broken pact with their chimpanzee child extend, by association, to the family of man and its dysfunctional relationship with the entire zoosphere.</p><p>Many a novel has devoted itself to exploring variations of Larkin's lament about what mums and dads do to their kids. But if any other book has done it as exhilaratingly as the achingly funny, deeply serious heart-breaker that is Fowler's 10th novel, and made it ring true for the whole of mankind, I've yet to read it. This is a moral comedy to shout about from the treetops.</p><p>• Liz Jensen's <em>The Uninvited </em>is published by Bloomsbury.</p>","headline":"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves review – 'A

Suzanne McCourt’s first novel, the Lost Child, adds another disturbing narrative to the genre.</p><p>The setting of this novel is all-important – the wild and windswept coast of South Australia where, from 1866 to the 1960s attempts have been made to discover oil. This landscape south of the Coorong provides a rough, tough, yet lyrical fabric on which McCourt examines the bleak, sad lives of her characters. The fishing village of Burley Point is opened up to the reader in all its brutal and touching detail. Just the names of the characters breathe the weird ethos of the town – Mrs Winkie, Uncle Ticker, Mrs Bullfrog, Mrs Bloomers.</p><p>The life of the first person narrator, Sylvie, from the age of five to 15, is strung on and woven through the historical events and key brand names of the period. Wunderwax, Turf cigarettes, Phantom comics, Thalidomide – there are many kinds of nostalgia here. From the coronation in 1952 to the mid-60s – the assassination of Kennedy, Vietnam, the Beatles – the reader sees the world unfold through Sylvie’s sharp and knowing mind. It is clear that the clever, imaginative, poetic Sylvie will ultimately move on from Burley Point, but every stage of her life is scarred by the misery of poverty and a dysfunctional family.</p><p>The narrative is regularly marked with images of disappearance and drowning, a kind of warning that the title of the novel will turn out to be as sinister and ominous as it seems. A woman called Wanda the Witch has a well where she “drowns children”; Mr Smythe “walked off the end of the jetty and drowned”. The “lost child” of the title is Sylvie’s beloved older brother Duncan who disappears mysteriously, and whose drowned remains are not discovered for many years (during a search for oil). Sylvie, who is not responsible for the death of her brother, is nevertheless burdened with guilt as well as sorrow.</p><p>She is a philosophical girl, wondering: “Does anyone get what they want?” and “What if there are no answers to anything?” But in the face of her mother’s mental instability, her father’s brutality, fecklessness and faithlessness, her brother’s disappearance, the cruelty of her peers, she perseveres and prevails.</p><p>Sophisticated in her imagery, she is able always to find analogies and similes which help her through. When her mother throws jam at the wall it reminds her of snail trails, which remind her of a boy jumping on snails, “and the way their green stomachs ooze out”. Her father scoops up her kitten as if it is a ball of “soft black knitting wool” and smashes it against the wall where it “cracks like a chopped mallee root”.</p><p>This is a cruel and terrible world in which a little child finds herself, yet her strengths are such that she survives, and in the end breaks free.<br></p>","headline":"The Lost Child review – 'brutal and touching detail'","trailText":"Suzanne McCourt’s debut novel is a haunting fable set on the windswept South Australian coast","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395277306243/ccbae518-ce76-4011-8c45-8c0f959019fd-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"501","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-23T14:45:28+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/the-lost-child-review-brutal-and-touching-detail","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/the-lost-child-review-brutal-and-touching-detail","tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/south-australia","webTitle":"South Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-australia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/south-australia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/carmel-bird","webTitle":"Carmel Bird","r2ContributorId":"59423","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383268962232/Carmel-Bird-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Carmel Bird is a novelist and reviewer.

I was two years old and had been born into the anti-Vietnam war movement. I was seven when Pol Pot was toppled a few years later, and the ghastly images of the killing fields made a strong impression on me. But it was not until I moved to Cambodia in 2001 that the country turned into something of an obsession. To me this intriguing little kingdom became a way to understand the world: through the Cambodian lens many things became clearer.</p><p>My first book about Cambodia, <a href=\"http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/from-pol-pots-smile\" title=\"\">Pol Pot's Smile</a>, deals with the Khmer Rouge's devastating revolution and follows in the tracks of a Swedish delegation who travelled through the genocide without seeing anything alarming. My new book, <a href=\"http://pushkinpress.com/book/song-for-an-approaching-storm/\" title=\"\">Song for an Approaching Storm</a>, is set in the 50s, two decades before the catastrophe. The two have enabled me to spend years in Cambodia, both in the past and the present.</p><p>One might look at my following selection and ask where the contemporary Cambodian novels are. The answer, sadly, is that the authors in Cambodia are marginalised and struggling – there aren't even any publishing houses. Very little of their work is translated into English. Thus, there are many foreign authors in the following list. But good literature knows no nationality or borders.</p><h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/vann-nath-obituary\" title=\"\">A Cambodian Prison Portrait by Vann Nath</a></h2><p>There are many myths about the Khmer Rouge's bloodthirstiness and brutality, but there was at least one place where they all were real: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum\" title=\"\">Security Prison 21</a>, the secret police's killing machine. Of the 14,000 or so prisoners who were brought there for questioning, only a handful survived. One of them were the artist Vann Nath (1946-2011). In this thin little book, he describes his horrifying year behind the barbed wired walls of S-21. I had the privilege to meet him a couple of times and to me he was a man of very rare moral dignity; he resembled a Cambodian Nelson Mandela. He pitied his torturers as fellow humans, without forgiving them their deeds. This book ranks among the most important and strongest witness-stories of world literature.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/132970/sea-wall\" title=\"\">The Sea Wall by Marguerite Duras</a></h2><p>Marguerite Duras's breakthrough novel was published in 1950 and most of the elements that would become the base for her masterpiece, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/book-of-a-lifetime-the-lover-by-marguerite-duras-2362943.html\" title=\"\">The Lover</a>, more than 30 years later are already there. A fatherless French teenager, living in great poverty at a small plantation in rural Cambodia, gets involved with a much older but wealthy Chinese businessman. Age, race and class make them an impossible couple. Her mother and brother cynically tries to wring a few piastres out of the indecent affair. Less romantic and more sleazy than The Lover, but equally good.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/04/tracked-down-khmer-rouge-killer-14000\" title=\"\">The Lost Executioner by Nic Dunlop </a></h2><p>The head of S-21, Kang Kek Iew, AKA Comrade Duch, is central in this remarkable book. In 1997, the photographer and journalist Nic Dunlop more or less stumbled upon Duch, who had been hiding since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. Duch is a paradoxal figure: with a poor peasant background, he graduated as the second best student in the country. He got drawn into the Khmer Rouge and rose through the ranks. After the fall of the regime, he became a born again Christian. Dunlop's book is empathic, intelligent and a real page-turner. The monster becomes a man.</p><h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.thekeypublish.com/index.php/component/virtuemart/search\" title=\"\">Building Cambodia by Helen Grant Ross and Darryl Leon Collings</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432565285'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395235927191/The-Cambodian-National-Ol-009.jpg' alt='The Cambodian National Olympic stadium in Phnom Penh, designed by Vann Molyvann.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Cambodian National Olympic stadium in Phnom Penh, designed by Vann Molyvann. Photograph: Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In the romantic picture of the old French Indochina, there are beautifully faded colonial buildings. But in Cambodia, it is actually the structures from the following decades that are the most fascinating. Blending traditional architecture with European modernism, the then young Cambodian architects, led by the maestro Vann Molyvann, created a fascinating school, like a Cambodian Bauhaus. This short-lived movement's legacy is now being destroyed by short-sighted capitalism. But the story is well told in this book, awash with beautiful photographs.</p><h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.bookslut.com/nonfiction/2005_04_005322.php\" title=\"\">Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare by Philip Short</a></h2><p>In David Chandler's excellent biography Brother Number One from 1993, the author has an eerie feeling of being watched by the elusive and smiling dictator while he is writing the book. A decade later, Philip Short manages to drag Pol Pot out of the shadows. Where the earlier biographer had a more academic approach, Short's book reads almost like a thriller at times. The research he has put into the book is in itself mindblowing, and the result constitutes a large and important step towards understanding the Cambodian tragedy.</p><h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.travelbooks.co.uk/book_detail.asp?id=17\" title=\"\">A Dragon Apparent by Norman Lewis </a></h2><p>This modern classic was once a beautiful account of a distant place: French Indochina in its twilight. Now it is also the story of a lost world. Norman Lewis traveled through Saigon to Phnom Penh, and then via Angkor Wat on to Laos. Every person Lewis meets – monks, farmers, royalty, colonialists – become important in his or her own right; the writer's keen eye for telling detail puts the reader right beside him.</p><h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.signalbooks.co.uk/book.php?a=1904955401\" title=\"\">Phnom Penh by Milton Osborne</a></h2><p>It's easy to be seduced by Phnom Penh, but also to be exhausted, as it's overwhelming in so many ways. It is therefore most helpful to read Milton Osborne's personal and interesting cultural and literary history of this fairly new capital (permanent since 1866). Osborne arrived in 1959 and the city has since been a continuing part of his life. His book will make the bustling city more comprehensible – though it remains as overwhelming as ever.</p><h2>8. <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kwTRAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cambodian+folk+stories+from+the+gatiloke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DZQpU93cCoHAhAfMk4CgCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cambodian%20folk%20stories%20from%20the%20gatiloke&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Cambodian Folk Stories from the Gatiloke by Kong Chhean</a></h2><p>A handful of the 112 folk stories in the Gatiloke, which was used by Cambodian monks to teach their faith and committed to paper in the late 19th century. One shouldn't make too much of this mix of fables, fairytales and moral lessons, but they offer an interesting insight into some traditional Cambodian beliefs. Some of them have slapstick qualities; others draw moral conclusions that are surprising to a western reader.</p><h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.silkwormbooks.com/each_titles/e_cambodia/redbook.html\" title=\"\">Pol Pot's Little Red Book by Henri Locard </a></h2><p>This is an intriguing little book for the interested reader who has already one or two more general titles about the Khmer Rouge under his belt. Henri Locard has collected and commented on hundreds of Khmer Rouge propaganda sayings; together they open the door to the chilling and paranoid mindset the revolution created. To quote one of the most famous lines: \"To destroy you is no loss; to preserve you is no gain.\"</p><h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Faces-Han-Suyin/dp/B0007ERYAI\" title=\"\">Four Faces by Han Suyin</a></h2><p>This novel is a charming bagatelle in Han Suyin's oeuvre. The story is set in the early 60s and revolves around a farcical author congress in Siem Reap, the small, sleepy town in the shadow of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/angkorwat\" title=\"\">Angkor Wat</a>. The congress is just a facade for cold-war conspiracy and suspicion – and shady opium trafficking. The farce, lightly sprinkled with eroticism, turns briefly into a political thriller, and then after a murder and a failed coup d'état, it turns yet again and becomes an Agatha Christie-inspired whodunnit, with the peaceful and slightly surreal Cambodian kingdom as a backdrop.</p>","headline":"Top 10 books about Cambodia","trailText":"<p>From a portrait of Pol Pot to a collection of ancient oral tales, <strong>Peter Fröberg Idling</strong> provides 10 titles essential to understanding the Asian nation</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395235591897/Heart-of-gold---a-pagoda--006.jpg","wordcount":"1174","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-26T13:08:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/top-10-books-about-cambodia-pol-pot-peter-froberg-idling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/19/top-10-books-about-cambodia-pol-pot-peter-froberg-idling","tags":[{"id":"books/series/toptens","webTitle":"Top 10s","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/toptens","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/toptens","references":[]},{"id":"books/history","webTitle":"History","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/history","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/history","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/travel-writing","webTitle":"Travel writing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/travel-writing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/travel-writing","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"world/pol-pot","webTitle":"Pol Pot","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pol-pot","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pol-pot","references":[]},{"id":"world/khmer-rouge","webTitle":"Khmer Rouge","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/khmer-rouge","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/khmer-rouge","references":[]},{"id":"world/cambodia","webTitle":"Cambodia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cambodia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/cambodia","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"travel/cambodia","webTitle":"Cambodia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/cambodia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/cambodia","references":[]},{"id":"travel/asia","webTitle":"Asia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/asia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/asia","references":[]},{"id":"travel/travel","webTitle":"Travel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/travel","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/travel/travel","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432565282","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395235580773/Heart-of-gold---a-pagoda--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Tang Chhin Sothy","altText":"Heart of gold … a pagoda in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.","height":"54","credit":"Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Heart of gold … a pagoda in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Henry Marsh has written a memoir of startling candour","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>We go to doctors for help and healing; we don't expect them to make us worse. Most people know the aphorism taught to medical students, attributed to the ancient Greek <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/jan/23/healthandwellbeing.health\" title=\"\">Hippocrates</a> but timeless in its quiet sanity: \"First, do no harm.\" But many medical treatments do cause harm: learning how to navigate the risks of drug therapies, as well as the catastrophic consequences of botched or inadvised surgical operations, is a big part of why training doctors takes so long. Even the simplest of therapies carries the risk of making things worse. Drugs such as statins that lower cholesterol might reduce your risk of&nbsp;stroke or heart attack, but they also&nbsp;stiffen your muscles and inflame your liver. Drugs to thin your blood against clots run the risk of devastating haemorrhage. Operations to remove prostate&nbsp;cancer might leave you impotent and incontinent; removing a&nbsp;gall bladder can ruin your digestion. The most dangerous speciality is widely considered to be neurosurgery. When a&nbsp;surgeon meddles with your brain it's not just incontinence or bad digestion you risk but coma, paralysis and death.</p><p>Brain surgeons such as Henry Marsh, the author of this startling and moving memoir, have to live, breathe, operate and make urgent decisions in full awareness of a terrible dilemma: if they&nbsp;open the skull they might save the patient's life, but a slip of the scalpel can cause appalling disability, which, as Marsh puts it, can be much worse than death. I worked as a junior neurosurgical trainee once, at the bottom of what he calls \"the strict medical hierarchy\", and realised then that living with such responsibility is not just onerous, it utterly transforms the lives of those who bear it. It's understandable that it should be demanding: most of us, if we were to have our brains cut open, would prefer it be done by someone who prioritises their work over their personal life. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;trainee I realised that I had too many other interests to be a good neurosurgeon, and quit for emergency medicine – a tranquil backwater by comparison. Readers of this book, as well as the thousands of patients Marsh has treated over his career can be&nbsp;thankful that he did not.</p><p>He describes visiting a nursing home in the countryside outside London, run by Catholic nuns and dedicated to&nbsp;the long-term care of patients with catastrophic brain damage. Walking along the quiet, orderly corridors he recognised \"at least five\" of the names on the door plaques as those of former patients of his – the home is like a museum of his operative failures. Cut&nbsp;by cut, chapter by chapter, he takes&nbsp;the reader through many of these &nbsp;\"failures\", and the well appreciated risks he and his patients knew they were taking, as well as behind the closed doors of a successful malpractice suit made against him. Passing a young colleague in the intensive care unit, just after visiting a&nbsp;patient rendered comatose through surgery, he remarks: \"Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don't do it.\" It's this disarming candour that makes the book such an enthralling read. Marsh is&nbsp;not interested in giving us a glossed image of the brain surgeon as superman; he wants to shows us the dreadful pressures under which he has lived throughout his professional life.</p><p>A friendly orthopaedic surgeon, called in to set Marsh's broken leg, pities him for his choice of career. \"Neurosurgery,\" he says, \"is all doom and gloom.\" But this is not a gloomy book, it is a testimony of wonder – the wonder Marsh has felt through being able to operate on the brain. Many of the chapters describe his triumphs, and, in intricate and fascinating detail, his daily work. As a junior surgeon the first procedure he witnessed was to clip an aneurysm – a pathological weakening of a brain artery that, if it ruptures, can cause paralysis or death. The operation seemed to him charged with meaning and set him off on his career. \"What could be finer, I thought, than to be a neurosurgeon?\" he writes. \"The operation involved the brain, the&nbsp;mysterious substrate of all thought and feeling, of all that was important in&nbsp;human life – a mystery, it seemed to me, as great as the stars at night and the universe around us.\" The wonder doesn't leave him: decades later, separating two lobes at the back of the&nbsp;brain, he reveals the pineal gland, which Descartes believed to be the seat&nbsp;of the soul. It is \"a secret and mysterious area where all the most vital functions that keep us conscious and alive are to be found. Above me, like the great arches of a cathedral roof,&nbsp;are the deep veins of the brain …&nbsp;this is anatomy that inspires awe in&nbsp;neurosurgeons.\"</p><p>But if this book is about wonder, it is&nbsp;also about entitlement. Exhilarated after performing a successful and protracted life-saving operation one day, he confesses how irritating it was to have to stand in the queue at the supermarket: \"'What did you do today?' I felt like asking them, annoyed that an important neurosurgeon like myself should be kept waiting.\" This plea for special treatment would come across as insufferably self-important were it not balanced by Marsh's awareness of how pompous he can sound. We're also given to understand that by living so long under the seismic pressure of such responsibility, Marsh has earned himself some privileges.</p><p>It's the incremental stripping of those privileges that take up the final quarter of the book; his sense as he approaches retirement that he is expected to bow before the management newspeak, health and safety directives and \"clinical governance protocols\" that are overwhelming the modern NHS – initiatives that no one understands and&nbsp;that do nothing for patient care. He&nbsp;describes wards full of agency staff who don't know where his patients are,&nbsp;or hours spent trying to find brain scans lost by the latest computer system. Government meddling has made his clinical career into a game of&nbsp;musical chairs, he says. The coalition has taken this one step further: not content just to pull away resources, it&nbsp;keeps on changing the orchestra.</p><p>Marsh's style is admirably clear, concise and precise, as you'd expect from someone accustomed to writing operation and clinic notes in a hurry. It is unexpectedly honest on a range of controversial issues facing the modern health service, even as Marsh expresses his relief that he's about to retire from it.&nbsp;It&nbsp;touches on the way greed leads some&nbsp;surgeons to perform ill-advised operations in private practice, as well&nbsp;as the corrupting influence of Big&nbsp;Pharma (Marsh's charitable work in Ukraine has shown him how drug trials are often fixed by corrupt and desperate physicians). There is no forcing of a narrative arc or a happy ending, just the quotidian frustrations, sorrows, regrets and successes of neurosurgical life. \"They call us heroes, and sometimes gods,\" Marsh writes of his patients. \"Perhaps they never quite realised just how dangerous the operation had been and how lucky they were to have recovered so well. Whereas the surgeon, for a while, has known heaven, having come&nbsp;very close to hell.\"</p><p>• Gavin Francis's <em>Empire Antarctica</em> was shortlisted in&nbsp;the Costa book awards.

Noting that the poems, written between 1950 and 1983, spanned the period during which Adams attended the school, she managed to track down the late author's effort.</p><p>Written in January 1970, when Adams would have been 17, the poem is entitled \"A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining\", and stretches to two pages. \"For nights I sat musing / And musing ... and musing / Whilst burning the midnight oil; / My scratchings seemed futile / My muse seemed quite mute, while / My work proved to be barren toil,\" writes the schoolboy who would go on to become one of the UK's most loved authors. \"I puzzled and thought and wrestled and fought / 'Till my midnight oil was exhausted, / So I furthered my writing by dim candle lighting, / And found, to my joy, this of course did / The trick.\"</p><p>Tragedy lies ahead for the poet, however: \"That which had ignited my literary passion, / Was about to ignite what my passion had fashion'd,\" he mourns. \"And - oh! - all was lost in a great conflagration / And I just sat there and said 'Hell and damnation'.\"</p><p>Harmer said that the long-running Candlesticks society would only allow pupils to join if they wrote, and read aloud, a poem on the subject of a candle, which was then found to be sufficiently good by current members of the literary group. \"The school at the time had various different cliques or societies,\" she said. \"At Candlesticks, which admitted only a select few, they would get together and read plays. In order to join you had to write a poem on the theme of a candle, and read it aloud, and if they liked it you were allowed in.\"</p><p>Adams's attempt was \"deemed good enough\", she said, describing the author's entry as \"a really good poem - quite witty\".</p><p>Harmer also uncovered a poem by Adams's fellow pupil Griff Rhys Jones, \"The Candle (A Lament)\", in which the comedian writes regretfully of how \"There was a time when Candle Light / Was pristine, pure and clean and bright\", but how now, \"Oh! Awful sight! / We turn to cold electric light.\"</p><p>\"Candlesticks was a group of boys who would come together and read plays, that was the point,\" <a href=\"http://www.brentwoodgazette.co.uk/Lost-poems-Griff-Rhys-Jones-Douglas-Adams/story-20823862-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Rhys Jones told local paper</a> the Brentwood Gazette, admitting he had quite forgotten his own poem.</p><p>\"There were only around 10 of us but we rather considered ourselves quite clever boys. Douglas was at the preparatory as well and even as a junior schoolboy he was given a lot of stars for his creative writing, he always used to talk about that,\" said Rhys Jones.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/15/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Adams died in May 2001</a>, aged 49, leaving behind him works including The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

But novelists are storytellers, not history teachers, argues Stephanie Merritt<br /><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/hilary-mantel-author-booker?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel on dealing with history in fiction</a><br />","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Does historical fiction have a duty to be factually accurate? It's a question I've found myself discussing a lot lately, most recently on BBC Radio 4's Today programme with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahchurchwell\" title=\"\">Sarah Churchwell</a>, who claimed that some historical novelists use \"poetic licence\" as an excuse for sloppy or minimal research. I had a conversation on the same theme the week before at the Independent Bath Literature festival with fellow novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarah-dunant\" title=\"\">Sarah Dunant</a>, who argued forcefully that authors have a responsibility to not present readers with deliberately false information about a historical character or period, and to make clear how much they have invented.</p><p>It's certainly true that historical fiction is enjoying a boom at the moment, from heavyweight prizewinners such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/hilary-mantel-author-booker?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a> and Andrew Miller to more populist series from authors including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/26/other-queen-philippa-gregory\" title=\"\">Philippa Gregory</a>, or historical crime by the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/27/fiction.crimebooks\" title=\"\">CJ Sansom</a>, Jed Rubenfeld or my own alter ego, SJ Parris. It's also the case that for many readers, a historical novel might be their point of entry or perhaps their only real window into a particular period. Shouldn't authors therefore take care not to spread an \"incorrect\" version of what actually happened?</p><p>Well, no, in my view, although I do agree with Churchwell on the paramount importance of meticulous research. But novelists are not history teachers. It's not our job to educate people, and if we start using words like \"duty\" and \"responsibility\" about historical fiction – or any fiction – we're in danger of leaching all the vigour out of it with a sense of worthiness. A novelist has no real duty to anything except the story he or she is creating, the characters who inhabit it and whatever view of the world he or she is offering with the novel's ending. But if you are going to play fast and loose with historical fact for the sake of a good story, you'd better have done your research thoroughly if you want readers to take you seriously; only then will you have the authority to depart from those facts.</p><p>I have no problem with the idea of an author reinventing Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter, for example, as long as the fantasy is grounded in a knowledge of his biography and the book is well-written. At least it's obvious to readers that it's made up. Far more irritating to me are films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/09/drama.periodandhistorical\" title=\"\">Becoming Jane</a>, which seemed so taken with the idea of turning Jane Austen into one of her own romantic heroines that it brushed aside even the most basic understanding of Austen's life and circumstances.</p><p>I've had a reader take me to task – rightly – over an incorrect detail of clothing worn by the hero of my books, the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, even while they seemed quite happy to accept the much more flagrant invention of turning him into a spy who solves murders. Among my favourite novels as a teenager were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/03/biography.fiction\" title=\"\">Peter Ackroyd</a>'s The House of Doctor Dee and Hawksmoor, historical novels that shade into magic and fantasy, but do so from a solid foundation of knowledge of the period. I may not have learned \"accurate\" history from those books, but I acquired a love for the atmosphere of the past through the imagination of a great storyteller.</p><p>\"Histori<figure data-media-id='gu-image-432479533'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/25/1385381883969/Peter-Ackroyd-009.jpg' alt='Peter Ackroyd' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inspiration … Peter Ackroyd's novels shade into magic and fantasy, from a solid historical foundation.

We can point to certain events taking place on certain dates – though the further back you go, the more even the dates are open to doubt – but we often don't know what was said off the record, or how the principal players behaved when the chroniclers looked away. These undocumented areas often provide the most private, human moments, away from the public stage, and the blank spaces they leave are irresistible to a novelist. Even \"straight\" biographers and historians are not above a bit of imaginative colouring-in if it brings the story to life.</p><p>The growing popularity of narrative non-fiction, together with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/11/bbc-warnings-faked-elements-documentary-hidden-kingdom\" title=\"\">the penchant for dramatising key scenes</a> in TV history documentaries, are a further reminder that stories and characters engage our imaginations beyond dates, treaties and troop movements – though in the best history and biography, you'd hope to find both.</p><p>The words \"based on\" and \"author's note\" are essential to the historical novelist's toolkit. By making clear that you're writing fiction, you claim the freedom to speculate, to stray beyond what is known, and so breathe new life into long-dead characters. Any attempt to recreate the past requires a leap of imagination. If a bit of poetic licence in historical fiction helps to keep people's interest in the past alive, so much the better.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007481194\" title=\"\">Treachery by SJ Parris</a> is published by HarperCollins</p>","headline":"How true should historical fiction be?","trailText":"From Hilary Mantel to Andrew Miller to Philippa Gregory, historical fiction is enjoying a boom.

Almost 90 years after JRR Tolkien translated the 11th-century poem Beowulf, The Lord of the Rings author's version of the epic story is to be published for the first time in an edition which his son Christopher Tolkien says sees his father \"enter[ing] into the imagined past\" of the heroes.</p><p>Telling of how the Geatish prince Beowulf comes to the aid of Danish king Hroðgar, slaying the monster Grendel and his mother before - spoiler alert - being mortally wounded by a dragon years later, Beowulf is is the longest epic poem in Old English, and is dated to the early 11th century. It survives in a single manuscript, housed at the British Library, and has inspired countless retellings of the myth - recently and famously by the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/seamus-heaney-beowulf-anglo-saxo\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a>, whose translation won him the Whitbread book of year award in 1999.</p><p>Tolkien himself called the story \"laden with history, leading back into the dark heathen ages beyond the memory of song, but not beyond the reach of imagination\", saying that \"the whole thing is sombre, tragic, sinister, curiously real\".</p><p>Although the author completed his own translation in 1926, he \"seems never to have considered its publication\", said Christopher Tolkien today, announcing the Tolkien estate's new deal with HarperCollins to publish Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary on 22 May. The book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, will also include the series of lectures Tolkien gave at Oxford about the poem in the 1930s, as well as the author's \"marvellous tale\", <a href=\"http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sellic_Spell\" title=\"\">Sellic Spell</a>.</p><p>Tolkien's \"creative attention to detail\" in his lectures gives rise to  a sense of the immediacy and clarity of his vision\", said his son. \"It is as if he entered into the imagined past: standing beside Beowulf and his men shaking out their mail-shirts as they beached their ship on the coast of Denmark, listening to the rising anger of Beowulf at the taunting of Unferth, or looking up in amazement at Grendel's terrible hand set under the roof of Heorot.\"</p><p>Tolkien also closely considers the dragon which would slay Beowulf, writing of how the beast was \"snuffling in baffled rage and injured greed when he discovers the theft of the cup\" – an image reminiscent of his own thief Bilbo Baggins, sneaking into the lair of the dragon Smaug in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jan/08/review-jrr-tolkien-the-hobbit\" title=\"\">The Hobbit</a> – but, said his son, the author \"rebuts the notion that this is 'a mere treasure story … just another dragon tale'\".</p><p>\"He turns to the lines that tell of the burying of the golden things long ago, and observes that it is 'the feeling for the treasure itself, this sad history' that raises it to another level,\" said Christopher Tolkien.</p><p>JRR Tolkien died in 1973,  having seen The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings achieve success, and leaving behind him a swath of previously unpublished works. Several have been released over the last few years, including his poem The Fall of Arthur, set in the last days of Arthur's reign and inspired by Geoffrey of Monmouth and Thomas Malory, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/04/jrr-tolkien-sigurd-gudrun-poem\" title=\"\">The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún</a> in 2009 and his unfinished Middle-Earth story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/jrrtolkien.fiction\" title=\"\">The Children of Húrin</a> in 2007.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.johngarth.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Garth</a>, author of Tolkien and the Great War, said the epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf had \"a deep and detailed impact on what Tolkien wrote – from his earliest poem of Middle-earth, written in September 1914, right through The Hobbit with the theft of a cup from a dragon hoard, and The Lord of the Rings with the arrival at the halls of Rohan\".</p><p>The author also, said Garth, changed attitudes to Beowulf \"completely in a 1936 talk which rescued this marvellous poem from being treated as a mere quarry for historical enquiry\".</p><p>\"It's been known for many years that Tolkien had translated the poem, and there were rumours back in 2004 that this work would be published imminently. This is long-awaited, and hugely exciting for Tolkien readers,\" said Garth.</p><p>The poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/simonarmitage\">Simon Armitage</a>, who hit the bestseller lists with his own translation of the Middle English epic poem <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/08/simonarmitage\" title=\"\">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a>, called Tolkien's Beowulf a \"tantalising prospect\", adding that the author's translation of Sir Gawain \"is a master class in linguistic chicanery – some sections of it read as older than the original! Middle English meets Middle Earth\".</p><p>\"As a Prof of Old English, Beowulf would have always been in his mind and in his sights,\" said Armitage. \"The fact that his Beowulf has slept dusty and unpublished for so long makes me wonder if he felt confident about publishing it at all. But given the current taste for his work and the film versions of his books, it will be interesting to see if it gives Heaney's Beowulf a run for its money, which was a huge bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic and seems to be regarded at the moment as the definitive contemporary version. I can already see it in Waterstones - the leather-bound, illustrated gift edition, filed next to The Hobbit and the boxed DVD Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>Beowulf opens \"Hwæt w GrDena in gar-dagum / Þod-cyninga þrym gefrnon, / H p æþelingas ellen fremedon\", lines which were translated by Heaney as \" So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by / and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. / We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns.\"</p><p>The opening, Hwæt, has <a href=\"http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/beowulf/introbeowulf.htm\" title=\"\">long foxed scholars</a>, with translations ranging from Heaney's \"so\" to \"lo\", \"hark\", \"behold\", \"attend\" and \"listen\". HarperCollins would not comment on how Tolkien approached Beowulf's famous opening, but all will be revealed come May.</p>","headline":"JRR Tolkien translation of Beowulf to be published after 90-year wait","trailText":"<p>The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings author's version of epic Anglo-Saxon poem fleshes out heroes' past, reports <strong>Alison Flood</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395228757621/JRR-Tolkien-1955-008.jpg","wordcount":"919","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-25T11:19:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/jrr-tolkien-beowulf-translation-published","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/19/jrr-tolkien-beowulf-translation-published","tags":[{"id":"books/jrrtolkien","webTitle":"JRR Tolkien","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/jrrtolkien","references":[]},{"id":"books/classics","webTitle":"Classics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/classics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/classics","references":[]},{"id":"books/poetry","webTitle":"Poetry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/poetry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fantasy","webTitle":"Fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fantasy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fantasy","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/publishing","webTitle":"Publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432471767","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395228241679/Beowulf-film-012.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Paramount Pictures","altText":"Beowulf film","height":"1200","credit":"Paramount Pictures/AP","caption":"A still from the 2007 animated film Beowulf.

The only link to the great Labour victory of 1945 (when Jenkins first stood for parliament) was the vintage of the wine (Chateau Lafite) and the port (Quinta do Noval).</p><p>There are few better examples of genuine social mobility than this son and grandson of Welsh miners who became not just one of the most formidable politicians of his or any other era, but a writer whose books may well be read long after his considerable political achievements are forgotten. Jenkins was an apple who fell a fair distance from the tree.</p><p>Despite having what we would today describe as a \"back story\" worth flaunting in the inverted aristocracy of the Labour party, Jenkins resolutely refused to use it for political advantage. For some this suggested that he was ashamed of his origins; that his air of <em>de&nbsp;haut en bas</em> was a deliberate attempt to&nbsp;escape his past. But Jenkins would have considered the romantic notion that he dragged himself from the coal face to the dispatch box as fraudulent.</p><p>It was his father, Arthur Jenkins, who had navigated that route. Some readers of this marvellous biography by John Campbell will come away with mixed feelings about Jenkins junior, but few will fail to admire his father; the coal worker who took full advantage of the educational opportunities offered by his union for \"self-improvement\". Arthur was proud to say he went to Oxford but it was to Ruskin College on a scholarship rather than Balliol, where his son went to study PPE (it was a path to a political career even then).</p><p>By the time Arthur and Hattie Jenkins's only child was born in 1920 Arthur was a full-time union official on a middle-class income. Their house was away from the pit villages, with a live-in maid and a head teacher for a neighbour. Campbell describes Arthur Jenkins as \"gentle, bookish, internationalist and resolutely un-militant\". His imprisonment during the general strike was a miscarriage of justice; the nine-month sentence was soon reduced to a few weeks because of public outrage. Young Roy was told that his father was on a union visit to Germany and was bemused by the brass band and cheering crowds that welcomed him back.</p><p>By the time Roy was 14 Arthur had been elected as Labour MP for Pontypool. For seven years, during the war and beyond, he served as Attlee's parliamentary private secretary before a brief period as a junior minister. So Jenkins's childhood resembled Tony Benn's more than it resembled Nye Bevan's.</p><p>What is perhaps surprising is not Jenkins's admirable refusal to play on what his followers saw as impeccable socialist roots, but his complete lack of interest in the trade-union movement, or indeed in workers' education, given how important they'd both been to his father's advancement.</p><p>Perhaps this was an aspect of the elitism he was consistently accused of. More likely he agreed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/donald-sassoon\" title=\"\">Donald Sassoon</a>'s observation that socialists got rid of a utopian albatross when they \"abandoned the idea that a single class – the traditional male factory-based proletariat – was somehow endowed by history with the task of embodying the hope and aspiration of&nbsp;the whole of humanity\". Jenkins seems to have destroyed this albatross a little sooner than most on the left.</p><p>At the time he was seeking to climb the greasy pole, courting popularity with the unions was essential to success in the Labour party. Instead the young Welsh Gaitskellite soon earned a reputation as a gourmandising dilettante. Roy certainly enjoyed his wine (although he had an aversion to vin blanc and his passion for vin rouge was mainly confined to fine claret). Campbell doesn't attempt an assessment of his subject's daily alcohol intake (as Jenkins did in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/13/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\">his biography of Churchill</a>) but David Steel records his amazement at how much his great ally could drink at lunch, yet remain unaffected. Throughout his entire political career Jenkins set aside at least an hour and a half every day for a proper lunch with somebody he considered important and convivial. The concept of grabbing a quick sandwich was as alien to him as helping with the housework. As Campbell points out, his subject led an extraordinarily pampered life and if he had a great deal of time to read and write \"it was because there was literally nothing else he was required to do except eat, drink and talk\". Jennifer, his wife of almost 60 years, was amazingly tolerant of this and his other peccadillos.</p><p>The sexual revelations in this book have understandably attracted all the pre-publication publicity. Campbell, however, sets out masterfully the full&nbsp;range of Jenkins's achievements. Considering that he was in parliament for 16 years before his first ministerial appointment he packed an awful lot into his eight years of red boxes and ministerial cars.</p><p>He had the audacity to refuse Wilson's first offer of a cabinet post at&nbsp;education, but the gamble paid off; he&nbsp;was made home secretary instead. Education went to his close friend from Balliol, Tony Crosland. In his autobiography Denis Healey described them as being as close as <a href=\"http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_dioscuri.htm\" title=\"\">Castor and Pollux</a>, but, as Campbell reveals, they were actually much closer.</p><p>A decade later, Crosland was made foreign secretary in the Callaghan government, the job that Jenkins longed for. He decided reluctantly to leave Westminster for Brussels, only to hear of Crosland's premature death six months later. Had he stayed he would almost certainly have succeeded his old buddy.</p><p>That Jenkins and Crosland had a gay relationship at Oxford is extraordinary for two reasons. First, it is revealing that the man who used his first spell as home secretary so effectively to legalise homosexuality had actually committed the illegal offence himself. Second, Jenkins was not only heterosexual from the time he met Jennifer, he was polyamorous (a very Jenkinsonian word) throughout their marriage. Campbell lists the string of lovers who were also family friends. Jenkins would never have an affair with a woman who didn't get on with Jennifer. It was all very French. Crosland, too, took his heterosexuality seriously. After many&nbsp;lovers he married the American journalist Susan Barnes. It's said that he insisted that space in his ministerial diary be preserved for \"conjugal rights\".</p><p>Campbell's portrait belies the view of Jenkins as a lazy hedonist. He certainly didn't fit Healey's depiction of him as Dickens's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-mutual-friend\" title=\"\">Mr Podsnap</a>. It's true that he had a mannered speaking style, forged in the debating chamber of the Oxford Union: one hand in jacket pocket, the other twisting and writhing in front of him like a snake, as one of his colleagues observed. (A senior Labour figure who knew him well once told me it was as if&nbsp;he were standing behind a buxom wench gently cupping her breast.)</p><p>He was also an extremely shy man but, reading this book, nobody could doubt his diligence or indeed his courage. When he went to defend his cabinet colleague Reg Prentice who was under threat of de-selection in Newham, extremists of right and left hijacked the&nbsp;meeting and turned it into a brawl. Jenkins was hit full on by a flour bomb thrown by a National Front thug. He refused to allow the police to be called and made a rousing speech looking like one of the Homepride men.</p><p>Few politicians can match Jenkins's achievements. In two periods as home secretary he pursued the cause of \"equal opportunity accompanied by cultural diversity in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance\" that he saw as essential to civilised living and social cohesion. As chancellor he \"righted the ship\" after Callaghan's devaluation and as deputy leader he remained consistent in his vision for Britain in Europe when his senior colleagues were performing screeching U-turns. In leading a rebellion by 79 Labour MPs he ensured an emphatic pro-European majority of 112 in a crucial parliamentary debate in October 1971.</p><p>By helping to create the SDP Jenkins believed he saved the Labour party from the Bennite madness of the early 80s. Others (including me) believe he should have stayed to fight alongside those who were determined to save Labour from the clutches of what Attlee once described as \"doctrinaire impossibleism\".</p><p>Had he stayed he would never have&nbsp;been leader, as he was of the SDP. He&nbsp;struggled in the world of 24-hour media and was too shy to go back-slapping. Neither would he have been&nbsp;–&nbsp;as he was following the 1982 byelection – the rather incongruous MP&nbsp;for Glasgow Hillhead (when asked if he&nbsp;would live in the constituency, he calmly explained that while he already owned two houses he would certainly consider acquiring a \"wesidency\" in the city). But he would, I am sure, have accelerated the process of reform and renewal that led to Labour becoming electable again.</p><p>The highest praise I can give to John Campbell's biography is that Roy Jenkins would have been proud to have been its author.</p><p>• Alan Johnson MP is a former home secretary.

title=\"\">Ancillary Justice</a> – a space opera about a spaceship trapped in a human body – competing with Egypt-born Ramez Naam's debut Nexus, in which an experimental drug links human beings mind

A third debut also makes the line-up: American novelist Kameron Hurley's God's War, about a bisexual bounty hunter who collects the heads of deserters.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-smythe\" title=\"\">James Smythe</a>, a growing force in British science fiction, makes the cut for The Machine, set in a near-future dystopia where memories can be recorded on machines.

This year, said director Tom Hunter, 34 books were submitted by female writers, a ratio of \"approximately one in four, [of which] one in three made it through to the discussion list of 30 titles from which the judges made their final selection today\". This ratio \"carried through into the final six shortlisted titles, two of which are by new female authors,\" said Hunter.</p><p>He called the shortlist \"such an excitingly fresh list, which really reflects new writers as well as classics of the genre\". The line-up, he said, shows the \"real vibrant health\" of science fiction today, with submissions received from 42 different publishing houses and imprints. \"There's a lot of energy in the genre at the moment,\" said Hunter.</p><p>Titles which failed to make the final cut for this year's Arthur C Clarke award include books by giants of the genre Terry Pratchett, Alastair Reynolds and Kim Stanley Robinson, as well as Ruth Ozeki's Booker-shortlisted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/15/tale-time-being-ozecki-review\" title=\"\">A Tale for the Time Being</a>, Atwood's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/08/maddaddam-by-margaret-atwood-review\" title=\"\">MaddAddam</a> and King's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/30/doctor-sleep-stephen-king-review\" title=\"\">Doctor Sleep</a>.</p><p>The judging panel features Ian Whates and Duncan Lawie from the <a href=\"http://www.bsfa.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Science Fiction Association</a>, and Sarah Brown and Lesley Hall from the <a href=\"http://www.sf-foundation.org/\" title=\"\">Science Fiction Foundation</a>, along with Georgie Knight from the <a href=\"http://www.sci-fi-london.com/\" title=\"\">Sci-Fi-London</a> film festival.

Everyone does it, no one really understands it, and writers love to speculate about just what happens when we drift off … And what might occur if, for some reason, we suddenly couldn't.</p><p>Literature abounds with examples of sleep as a way of cheating death or extending life, from <a href=\"http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19377\" title=\"\">Endymion</a> of Greek myth and Keats's poem, granted eternal sleep and deathlessness by his lover the moon goddess, to Washington Irving's <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/195/4.html\" title=\"\">Rip van Winkle</a>, who sleeps in the Catskill Mountains for 20 years, to science fiction's <a href=\"http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/suspended_animation\" title=\"\">suspended animation</a>, which allows space travellers to sleep for the hundreds of years it would take to traverse vast interstellar distances.</p><p>Take, for example, <a href=\"http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=278\" title=\"\">AE Van Vogt's Far Centaurus</a>, in which a spaceship crew are frozen to keep them alive across the trackless wastes of space only to find (<strong>spoilers ahead</strong> if you haven't read this 70-year-old short story) that they've been out for the count so long that humanity has developed faster-than-light technology and there's an established Earth colony waiting for them when they finally sputter up to their destination.</p><p>Once we venture beyond the wall of sleep, <a href=\"http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/bws.aspx\" title=\"\">as HP Lovecraft would have it</a>, technology and cosmic punchlines give way to fantasy and horror. Opening the 1919 tale \"Beyond The Wall of Sleep\" with an epigram from Shakespeare's great snoozer Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream (\"I have an exposition of sleep come upon me\"), Lovecraft writes: \"I have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong.\"</p><p>Neil Gaiman, of course, built a career on the exploration of the dream world with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/30/returning-neil-gaiman-sandman\" title=\"\">comic magnum opus Sandman</a>, recently resurgent, in which the pale Lord Morpheus ruled over the ever-shifting realm the Dreaming. Mortal dreamers appear briefly there during their sleeping hours in classic nightmare scenarios, running trouserless along endless corridors or serving up dishes at dinner parties thrown by Morpheus (they put their appearances in the Dreaming down to over-active imaginations). Almost a century ago, Windsor McCay's <a href=\"http://www.comicstriplibrary.org/display/111\" title=\"\">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a> strip began in the New York Herald: gorgeously drawn comics of a little dreamer's surreal adventures, always sharply concluded with Nemo awaking in his bed, sometimes falling from it. Nemo is surely a close cousin of <a href=\"http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/literature/eugenefield/poems/poemsofchildhood/wynkenblynkenandnod.html\" title=\"\">Wynken, Blynken and Nod</a> from Eugene Field's 1889 poem, three children taking to the dream-seas in a wooden shoe to fish among the stars.</p><p>Sleep isn't always a portal to a secondary fantasy world; sometimes opening the gate allows unknown entities access to the waking world. A recent example of this is <a href=\"http://www.thisishorror.co.uk/book-review-sleep-room-fr-tallis/\" title=\"\">FR Tallis's The Sleep Room</a>, in which mentally ill patients are kept under,  their perpetual slumber creating gateways for supernatural presences who lurk in the unknown dreamworld to pass through to reality.</p><p>Not all literary examinations of sleep are fantastical. Jonathan Coe's The House of Sleep is  an exploration of what happens when we have too much sleep, and not enough. Dreams dribble into reality and the long hours of insomnia tick inexorably on.</p><p>While children resist sleep, having to be ushered up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire where a pre-Gaiman Sandman waits to sprinkle dust into their eyes and hasten them to Little Nemo-esque adventures in the land of Nod, adults feel they never have enough sleep. And mass insomnia has been the subject of a clutch of recent books that really do give a new meaning to night terrors.</p><p>Mention must be made of Stephen King's 1994 novel <a href=\"http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/insomnia.html\" title=\"\">Insomnia</a>, an odd tale by even his standards, in which a man is suddenly struck sleepless and begins to see lab-coated gremlins in a strange plot that ties it into King's Dark Tower series. But it is mass insomnia that has caught the imagination recently, perhaps beginning with Charlie Huston's Sleepless in 2010, a noir-ish SF thriller in which a BSE-type prion causes utter sleeplessness in 10% of the population, leading to chaos and martial law in the States.</p><p>Insomnia could well be the new zombie apocalypse, certainly if the two most recent novels in this vein are to be believed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/08/science-fiction-roundup-reviews\" title=\"\">Nod by Adrian Barnes</a>, published by small West Yorkshire imprint Bluemoose early last year, found its way on to the Arthur C Clarke shortlist. Set in Vancouver, it posits an unexplained disaster, in which the vast majority of the world's population simply stop sleeping. Writer Paul is one of the very few who can still sleep, and finds himself at risk as the sleepless descend rapidly into madness and society collapses. Barnes explores the apocalypse on a localised scale as one of Paul's acquaintances, a homeless man called Charles, creates a community of exhausted insomniacs in Vancouver. Initially the mood is almost jolly, with echoes of GK Chesterton's <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49673.The_Napoleon_of_Notting_Hill\" title=\"\">The Naploeon of Notting Hill</a>, but it quickly degenerates into a dark and nightmarish cult bent on the bloody murder of children who still hold the power of sleep.</p><p>Cut so much from the same dream-cloth that you might wonder if the two authors shared the same cheeseboard before bed one night is Kenneth Calhoun's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/03/06/285740456/-black-moon-imagines-a-sleepless-american-nightmare\" title=\"\">Black Moon</a>, published in the UK by Hogarth this month. Again, a never-explained bout of mass-sleeplessness affects the world, which once more swiftly spirals into lawlessness and the breakdown of society. Calhoun adds a grim touch to his insomnia epidemic: the sleepless are driven into fits of homicidal rage by the very presence of a sleeper, and the novel is a heart-stopping quest to reach a west coast military base where a rumoured cure is being developed, all the while avoiding the shambling, violent insomniacs desperate for sleep.</p><p>It's not a new idea, of course – witness <a href=\"http://www.readprint.com/work-338/Sleepy-Anton-Chekhov/contents\" title=\"\">Anton Chekhov's \"Sleepy\"</a>, in which a young sleep-deprived nurse is driven to strangle the baby in her charge – but these two books in particular are chilling simply because they are so close to home. If you've ever suffered from insomnia or even said how \"wiped out\" or \"zombified\" you feel after not enough sleep, you'll understand just how the world depends on our nightly rituals to continue.</p><p>Early in Nod, Adrian Barnes' narrator Paul says: \"In sleep we all die, every one of us, every day. Why wasn't that fact noted more often? When we doze off each night there's never the slightest guarantee that we'll wake the next morning.\"</p><p>In sleep we surrender to the blackness, while prolonged wakefulness is the road to madness and damnation. If you can get to sleep tonight … sweet dreams.</p>","headline":"Read yourself to sleep … if you dare","trailText":"<p>Literature has a long relationship with sleep, whether too much or too little, but recent novels take insomnia into the realms of terror</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/18/1395159695423/Sleeping-child-006.jpg","wordcount":"1075","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-24T16:03:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/read-yourself-to-sleep-if-you-dare","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/read-yourself-to-sleep-if-you-dare","tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","webTitle":"Books blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"books/science-fiction","webTitle":"Science fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/science-fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/science-fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sleep","webTitle":"Sleep","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/sleep","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidbarnett","webTitle":"David Barnett","r2ContributorId":"26173","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Barnett is a journalist in the north of England and the author of two novels, Hinterland and Angelglass</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidbarnett","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidbarnett","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432408453","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/18/1395159688216/Sleeping-child-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"London Stereoscopic Company","altText":"Sleeping child","height":"54","credit":"London Stereoscopic Company/Getty Images","caption":"Stuff it, let's sleep.

Now his books charting their friendship have propelled him into an elite publishing club","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Samuel Johnson used to buy oysters for his cat, Hodge; Charles Dickens was so distressed when his own pet died that he had its paw stuffed and turned into a letter opener. Now, proving that there is nothing the British like more than a heartwarming story about an indomitable feline, the homeless busker turned author James Bowen, who wrote about how his cat changed his life in <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781444737097\">A Street Cat Named Bob</a>, has joined an elite club of writers to have sold more than one million copies of their books in the UK.</p><p>In 2007, Bowen, a recovering drug addict, found an injured Bob curled up on a step when he himself was living in sheltered accommodation. \"He gave me this look, almost saying, 'help', but also 'sort it out',\" said the author today. Bowen nursed Bob back to health, only to find the cat following him everywhere he went, even joining him when he busked and sold the Big Issue. The pair became well-known in London, going on to attract the attention of a literary agent, who sold Bowen's story of how, with Bob's help, he would get over his addictions to heroin and methadone, to Hodder &amp; Stoughton.</p><p>The publisher said today that in just two years, combined sales of A Street Cat Named Bob (written with Garry Jenkins), its sequel The World According to Bob and the children's book Bob: No Ordinary Cat, have now topped sales of 1m copies – 1,082,025 to be exact – in the UK, in all formats. The extraordinary sales bring Bowen into the company of publishing phenomena including JK Rowling, EL James, Stephenie Meyer and Dan Brown.</p><p>\"It's incredible,\" said Bowen. \"When I first saw Bob on this doorstep, I never thought this is where I'd be today.\"</p><p>Turning up for his first signing, Bowen had expected a maximum of 50 people. \"I don't think even Hodder thought there would be much of a turnout, but when there was a queue around the block, when they were turning people away and we had sold over 300 copies, I thought, 'what?' This is just about me and Bob and my life, talking about how I'm not perfect. Why are people so in love with this little man who's come into my life?\" he asked.</p><p>First published in March 2012, A Street Cat Named Bob has now spent close to two years in the UK top 10 bestseller list, and has also spent over a year on the Sunday Times bestseller lists in paperback – a feat that only 10 other titles have achieved since records began, said Hodder. Sold in 30 different countries, it has topped charts in the USA, Brazil, Portugal, and Turkey, while in Germany, it was No 1 for 27 consecutive weeks, said the publisher.</p><p>\"I think I've opened people's eyes to things they never understood properly,\" said Bowen of the book's success. \"I never ever thought I would be able to turn my life around … and be the voice of people who can't be heard.\"</p><p>The story clearly struck a chord with the UK's readers. \"His book signings have been absolutely massive – attracting up to 500 people at times,\" said Emilie Ferguson at Hodder, while a poll for World Book Day saw A Street Cat Named Bob chosen as one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/06/world-book-day-ten-best-teen-reads\" title=\"\">top 10 most life-changing books for teenagers</a>. The story has also been optioned for film, with a screenplay being developed by producer Adam Rolston.</p><p>Bowen's agent Mary Pachnos heralded the story's \"massive international success\", saying it \"goes to show that this lovely story, of the mutual love and respect between a man and his cat, resonates around the world\".</p><p>Bowen is far from the first writer to have had a special fondness for his pet cat. <a href=\"http://www.samueljohnson.com/qotw02q4.html\" title=\"\">James Boswell</a>, a cat-hater, wrote of the \"indulgence\" with which Johnson treated his cat Hodge, \"for whom he himself used to go out and buy oysters\". Mark Twain is also known as a cat lover – \" If man could be crossed with the cat it would improve man, but it would deteriorate the cat,\" he wrote – as were Ernest Hemingway, Dickens and TS Eliot. \"Lots of artistic people have cats,\" said Bowen. \"The thing about artists and cats is that cats are the owners of their own souls. They don't have a master, and artists feel that way too sometimes. A person can find a cat their muse. Bob is my muse.\"</p><p>The cat, however, \"isn't a deity – although he sometimes gets treated as one,\" said Bowen. \"He gets the most fan mail of any author in the Hachette company, [but] he's still naughty. I've had to put child locks on the fridge.\"</p><p>Bowen, now living in a rented flat, is currently <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/red-fox-publish-street-cat-prequel.html\">working on a new series of books for children</a> - apparently Bob himself chose the artwork by placing his paw on his approved illustrator - as well as a children's adaptation of The World According to Bob.</p>","headline":"Bob the Street Cat books sell 1m copies in UK","trailText":"<p>Homeless busker James Bowen adopted a stray cat.

Let's get down to the details of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philipkdick\" title=\"\">Philip K Dick</a>'s Ubik.</p><p></p><p>The book is largely told from the viewpoint of Joe Chip, who works for an agency of \"anti-psis\" that stops telepaths invading other people's privacy. This \"prudence organisation\" is run by a man called Runciter with the assistance of his wife, who has died physically but is kept in a state of \"half-life\" in a \"cold-pac\" specialised \"moratorium\" where Runciter is able to communicate with her.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Runciter agency's energy is dedicated to fighting a rival organisation of telepaths, run by Ray Hollis, that uses its powers to carry out corporate espionage and cause trouble. It looks as though they are about to have a grand showdown when Runciter takes Joe Chip and the top operatives in his organisation to the moon, where he has been offered a big, well-paying job taking on telepaths. This work has been arranged by Stanton Mick, a man with a nose like \"the rubber bulb on a new Delhi taxi horn, soft and squeezable. And loud. The loudest nose, he thought, that I have ever seen.\" As well as looking like a sound, Stanton Mick turns out to be a trap laid by Hollis. He isn't a man at all, but a \"self-destruct humanoid bomb\". He blows up …</p><p></p><p>At which point, I can hand the narrative baton over to Runciter himself. Late on in the book, he states boldly:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>Here's what happened. We got lured to Luna. We let Pat Conley come with us, a woman we didn't know, a talent we didn't understand – which possibly even Hollis didn't understand. An ability somehow connected with time reversion; not strictly speaking, the ability to travel through time … for instance, she can't go into the past either; what she does, as near as I can comprehend it, is start a counter-process that uncovers the prior stages inherent in configurations of matter.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>This explanation about Conley shows why time has been going backwards for Chip – why he has, apparently, landed in 1939. It's all Pat. And it must be her who is causing Joe's fellow anti-psis to die suddenly, by turning incredibly old and drying up. Of course, this being a Philip K Dick novel, there's more than one possibility about this time-slippage. As <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/33010748\" title=\"\">Reading Group contributor Craig Hughes</a> puts it, \"the much more radical notion of previous structures existing in the sub-strata of reality and emanating forward\". But I think Runciter's interpretation could accommodate that, too. It's still Pat, only operating in a different way.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Runciter hasn't explained everything. He hasn't, for instance, accounted for the fact that Joe saw Runciter die in the bomb explosion on the moon. It makes no sense that Runciter should be communicating with him in this way – and even less sense that messages from Runciter keep cropping up on TV, on signs, inside cigarette packets on store shelves.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, there is an alternative thesis. This one is provided by <a href=\"http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/lem5art.htm\" title=\"\">the novelist Stanislaw Lem</a>. He says it was actually Chip who almost died in the explosion on the moon:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>According to Ubik, people who, like Runciter's wife, have spent years in cold sleep are well aware of the fact. It is another matter with those who, like Joe Chip, have come close to meeting with a violent end and have regained consciousness imagining that they have escaped death, whereas in fact they are resting in a moratorium. In the book, it must be admitted, this is an unclear point, which is however masked by another dilemma: for, if the world of the frozen person's experiences is a purely subjective one, then any intervention in that world from outside must be for him a phenomenon which upsets the normal course of things. So if someone communicates with the frozen one, as Runciter does with Chip, this contact is accompanied in Chip's experiences by uncanny and startling phenomena.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>So, it's actually Runciter who lived and is trying to communicate with Joe? Lem goes on (and on):</p><p></p><p><blockquote>But, to go a step further, is not contact also possible between two frozen individuals? Might not one of these people dream that he is alive and well and that from his accustomed world he is communicating with the other one – that only the other person succumbed to the unfortunate mishap? This too is possible. And, finally, is it possible to imagine a wholly infallible technology? There can be no such thing. Hence certain perturbations may affect the subjective world of the frozen sleeper, to whom it will then seem that his environment is going mad – perhaps that in it even time is falling to pieces! Interpreting the events presented in this fashion, we come to the conclusion that all the principal characters of the story were killed by the bomb on the moon, and consequently all of them had to be placed in the moratorium and from this point on the book recounts only their visions and illusions. In a realistic novel (but this is a contradictio in adiecto) this version would correspond to a narrative which, after coming to the demise of the hero, would go on to describe his life after death. The realistic novel cannot describe this life, since the principle of realism rules out such descriptions. If, however, we assume a technology which makes possible the \"half-life\" of the dead, nothing prevents the author from remaining faithful to his characters and following them with his narrative – into the depths of their icy dream, which is henceforward the only form of life open to them.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>I'm sorry for the length of that quote – but it's a fantastic summary of how events work in the book. Or at least, it would be, if it actually worked. As Lem himself points out, there's a major flaw in this explanation, too. If everyone died, who put them all in cold storage and brought them back from the moon?</p><p></p><p>You can see that I'm now in trouble.</p><p></p><p>I also realise that I've expended 1,000 words without even mentioning Ubik, the substance that, true to its derivation from the Latin \"ubique\", is found everywhere in the book. Ubik appears most often in the form of an aerosol spray; it seems to counter time-regression and save the lives of those to whom it is applied. It could be taken as a divine symbol. It could be a more straightforward phallic symbol, <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/32973635\" title=\"\">as theorbys points out</a>. It could be what enables Runciter to manifest in Joe's world. It could also be some kind of anti-psychedelic, the thing that will bring Joe back to sobriety and reality.</p><p></p><p>I especially like that last idea. Remember how we learned early on that Joe had spent the night getting \"pizzled on papapot\"? Could it be that the entire novel is Joe's exhausted, paranoid, drugged-up delusion? Maybe he never got out of his apartment after his argument with the door. Maybe all the confusion is just inside his head?</p><p></p><p>The appeal of that last theory is that you could use it, like Ubik, to clear up nearly all the incidents in the book. It's just a shame that this house of cards is blown apart by that wonderful final chapter, which is told from Runciter's perspective, and notes his alarm when Chip's face starts appearing on his money …</p><p></p><p>At which point, I give up. If anyone has a coherent summary that wraps up all the conflict in the novel, I'd love to hear it, but I suspect the task is impossible. Not, I should stress, through any fault on the author's part. This is a book that gives real meaning to the cliche \"defies explanation\".</p><p></p><p>Like reality – what we see as reality, anyway – Ubik doesn't make much coherent sense. The unease, the difficulty, the contradictions are partly the point. It's all about the realisation that things aren't as they seem – that everything you thought you knew is wrong. As <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/32963614\" title=\"\">reading group contributor Mexican2 puts it</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>That moment when the symptom emerges, the first hint that all's not well, that the individual is constructing some harmonious whole to cover up the chaos … Ubik has these moments spread throughout like gems. The individual never becomes separate from the world because the individual never comes to any negotiated relationship with what the world is: something always disrupts that, whether it's the writing on the wall, or the money in your pocket.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Mexican2 went on to say.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>With Philip K Dick there isn't really a wrong that can be counterbalanced by leading to a right: you don't, at the end of Ubik, think this is how it really \"is\", I now know. Phil replaces a binary right and wrong altogether with a single status that is – for want of a better word – squishy.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>For want of a better word, I'd say \"squishy\" is ideal. You can't get a firm grip on Ubik. Try and squeeze it, and it moves. The more you look at it, the more it changes shape. I'm amazed Philip K Dick managed to keep it still long enough to get it on the page at all.</p>","headline":"Philip K Dick's Ubik: a masterpiece of malleability","trailText":"<strong>Sam Jordison:</strong> Incoherence and unease are the lifeblood of a novel that seems to squirm away the moment you think you've got a grip on it","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/18/1395144156118/Philip-K-Dick-android-004.jpg","wordcount":"1519","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-30T10:52:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/philip-k-dick-ubik-reading-group","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/philip-k-dick-ubik-reading-group","tags":[{"id":"books/series/reading-group","webTitle":"Reading group","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/reading-group","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/reading-group","references":[]},{"id":"books/philipkdick","webTitle":"Philip K Dick","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philipkdick","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/philipkdick","references":[]},{"id":"books/science-fiction","webTitle":"Science fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/science-fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/science-fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","webTitle":"Books blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432379884","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/18/1395144151086/Philip-K-Dick-android-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"John Gress","altText":"Philip K Dick android","height":"54","credit":"John Gress/Reuters","caption":"An android created in tribute to Philip K Dick on display at the 2005 NextFest technology show in Chicago.

So while <em>The Quarry</em> may not have been conceived of&nbsp;as a valedictory novel, it is now always going to be treated as one.</p><p>This means that any criticism is mildly muted, and the significance of&nbsp;its position in the Banksian oeuvre enhanced. This is fair enough, honourable and decent even; but it's still a novel, and readers still want to know what to expect.</p><p>You can expect much of what Banks has delivered before, but with added rage. Guy, in acute pain and distress at the humiliations visited upon him by his disease, rants against the dying of the light, and is very far indeed from being a noble sufferer. (It is a critical no-no among sophisticates to say \"I&nbsp;didn't like the character[s]\", but frankly, a little of Guy goes a long way, and there's a lot of him here.) The narrative voice – belonging to Kit, Guy's son – is a pleasant relief from this, if a familiar trope: Kit is well up there on the Asperger's spectrum, although the condition is only named once, and then in semi-dismissive passing. Basically, it's a literary device allowing us to look at things closely but entertainingly askew.</p><p>I've been reading Banks's work, on and off, since <em>The Wasp Factory</em> came out. Barely out of my teens then, I was at the ideal age to enjoy the book, and I&nbsp;did. At the time, there was some exciting controversy about it, with questions as to whether this was the literary equivalent of the \"video nasty\" (a phrase much in use then): a work of no artistic merit, designed to shock.</p><p>Still, in place even in his first novel were plenty of the elements that recurred throughout the next three decades, and are all present here: an unbalanced but charismatic father figure; a long-anticipated meeting of interested parties at the isolated locus of the narrative; a secret to be uncovered. And you can add the narrative voice itself: that oddly detached but highly observant tone with a special delight in&nbsp;improvised contraptions, or certain physical phenomena (in this book we&nbsp;get a pleasant and informative digression on laminar flow, the kind that makes the water from a tap running at just the right speed appear motionless. I have a weakness for this kind of thing.)</p><p>And there's the same old nagging question: is this actually a good book? This may cause a collective gasp of outrage from Banks's legions of fans, but then I would say that the reasons I have trouble with some aspects of Banks's writing are the very reasons why he has legions of fans in the first place; and these can be summarised as guilelessness, and the lack of a gap between idea and expression. It's not quite artlessness, more like a lack of cunning literary artifice. Banks's attention is all in the nuts and bolts of construction, and his characters, once established, never surprise, except in unsurprising ways.</p><p>So the people assembling at Guy's house – condemned to be eaten up by the quarry it abuts – are: a film critic of&nbsp;pronounced leftwing leanings; an opportunistic lawyer set to become a New Labour drop-in candidate; a couple of speakers of corporate gobbledegook; a sponging, useless hippy. All revolve around Guy, after their university days&nbsp;together in the 1990s. Guy rants, monotonously if understandably, against the state of the world and his illness; and everyone fulfils their roles,&nbsp;with a lost videotape being the MacGuffin they have all turned up to find. The main problem with all this is the conversation among the characters, which is, to my mind mistakenly, too close to actual speech to be in any way pleasurable to read. Even an idiot in a novel should be an entertaining idiot.</p><p>And yet, like all Banks's fiction that I&nbsp;have read, there is an underlying charm, almost a kind of innocence in the whole set-up and execution. For all&nbsp;its dark resonances, both deliberate and undeliberate, and the true, deep sadness behind the circumstances of its composition, there is something so damned likable about it all. Which is, I&nbsp;hasten to add, a good thing.</p>","headline":"The Quarry by Iain Banks review – a rant against the dying of the light","trailText":"<p><strong>Nicholas Lezard's paperback of the week: </strong>For all its dark resonances and the sadness behind the circumstances of its composition, there is something so damned likable about Banks's last book</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395061595467/Iain-Banks-006.jpg","wordcount":"702","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-02T11:46:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/18/quarry-iain-banks-review-nicholas-lezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/18/quarry-iain-banks-review-nicholas-lezard","tags":[{"id":"books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard's choice","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/series/nicholas-lezard-choice","references":[]},{"id":"books/iainbanks","webTitle":"Iain Banks","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/iainbanks","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/iainbanks","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholaslezard","webTitle":"Nicholas Lezard","rcsId":"GNL034660","r2ContributorId":"16172","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374241286766/Nicholas-Lezard.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicholas Lezard is a literary critic for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaslezard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholaslezard","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432373466","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395061566007/Iain-Banks-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Murdo Macleod","altText":"Iain Banks","height":"54","credit":"Murdo Macleod/Guardian","caption":"'An underlying charm' … Iain Banks.

After she had given birth to 14 children, she made a vow to live chastely with her husband, and embarked on pilgrimages to Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela, Italy and Germany. Her devotion was expressed through loud cries and roars, which often irritated bystanders, but she became famous as a mystic, and claimed to have conversations with God.</p><p>She dictated her life story to a priest, but her autobiography was only known through excerpts printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1501, and by Henry Pepwell, who called her a \"devoute ancres\",  in 1521, until a complete manuscript – thought to be a copy made from the original, possibly under Kempe's supervision – was discovered in a cupboard in the 1930s.</p><p>\"The story goes that when Colonel W Butler Bowdon was looking for a ping-pong bat in a cupboard at his family home near Chesterfield in the early 1930s he came across a pile of old books.&nbsp;Frustrated at the disorder, he threatened to put the whole lot on the bonfire the next day so that bats and balls would be easier to find in future.&nbsp;Luckily a friend advised him to have the books checked by an expert and shortly afterwards Hope Emily Allen identified one as the Book of Margery Kempe,\" said Sarah J Biggs, from the British Library's medieval team.</p><p>Biggs said the memoir, which has just been <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_61823\" title=\"\">digitised by the British Library</a>, was \"perhaps the first autobiography written in English\", and is also \"a remarkable record of the religious life of a woman during the tumultuous 14th and 15th centuries\".</p><p>Kempe refers to herself in her book in the third person as \"this creatur\", opening her story by telling of how after the birth of her first child she became ill and believed herself to be surrounded by devils. Forcibly restrained, she tore at her skin and bit her hand so hard she retained the marks for the rest of her life, before Jesus appeared to her in a vision and she grew calm.</p><p>\"Margery Kempe led an extraordinary life,\" said Biggs, \"and this manuscript is of incredible importance for scholars of this period. &nbsp;Prior to the 1930s this text was only known through 16th-century printed versions, and is the first such manuscript containing her autobiography. We are pleased to be able to make it available worldwide.\"</p><p>The first page of the manuscript states \"Liber Montis Gracie. This boke is of Mountegrace\", with the pages annotated by four scribes, said the British Library, \"probably monks associated with the&nbsp;Carthusian priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire\". Their notes highlight key passages, such as \"nota de clamore\" when Kempe utters her first cry, and \"mirabile\" to mark a miraculous event.</p><p>One of these miracles, said the British Library, occurs when Kempe meets a very learned priest, a \"Dewcheman\" (German) who could not understand what she said, so they had to speak to each other through an interpreter.&nbsp; Kempe advised the priest to pray for 13 days, and at the end of this \"he undirstod what sche seyd in Englysch to hym and sche undirstod what that he seyd. And yet he undirstod not Englisch that other men spokyn\".</p><p>\"A miracle indeed! But for Margery this was not an occasion to celebrate,\" said the library. Instead, \"sche sobbyd boistowsly and cryed ful lowde and horybly\".</p><p>\"One wonders what the learned priest's reaction could have been,\" said Biggs, adding that Kempe had been described by critics as everything from a religious eccentric to a feminist icon, a literary genius and an early social reformer, but that \"however we view her, there is no doubt that the work provides an invaluable insight into 15th-century urban life and into the religious practices of the period.\"</p>","headline":"Margery Kempe, the first English autobiographer, goes online","trailText":"<p>British Library digitises original edition of medieval mystic's 'extraordinary' account of her life</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395320042393/Margery-Kempes-autobiogra-007.jpg","wordcount":"657","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T12:36:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/margery-kempe-first-autobiographer-digitised-british-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/margery-kempe-first-autobiographer-digitised-british-library","tags":[{"id":"books/british-library","webTitle":"British Library","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/british-library","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/british-library","references":[]},{"id":"books/libraries","webTitle":"Libraries","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/libraries","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/libraries","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","webTitle":"Religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432585139","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395320036543/Margery-Kempes-autobiogra-003.jpg","typeData":{"source":"British Library","altText":"Margery Kempe's autobiography","height":"923","credit":"British Library","caption":"'Incredible importance' … a page from Margery Kempe's autobiography.

Sam Leith tucks in to Mina Holland's companionable guide to global gastronomy","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Here is a nice idea for a cookery book, amiably executed and attractively plated up. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mina-holland\" title=\"\">Mina Holland</a> has produced what you'd hesitate to call a&nbsp;whistle-stop tour – perhaps the metaphor should be a dim sum or tapas-style feast – of a number of the world's different cuisines. She is interested in how these styles of cooking draw on local ingredients and&nbsp;traditions, they way they sit in the&nbsp;culture and, above all, the way in which they have cross-fertilised with other food cultures. \"Food typifies everything that is different about another culture and gives the most authentic insight into how people live,\" she writes on the first page of her&nbsp;introduction, which is a bit of an overstatement but gives a flavour of the project.</p><p>Necessarily, depth is sacrificed for&nbsp;breadth. But breadth has its advantages. The text is interspersed with cute graphics – charts, tables, maps – that allow you to compare and&nbsp;contrast: a table showing, say, the different ingredients that go into the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/mirepoix\" title=\"\">mirepoix</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/05/chicken-sofrito-smoked-corn-recipes\" title=\"\">sofrito</a> of various cooking cultures; a simplified map of the spice routes; a table of different chillis; a graphic of the Americas showing how influences (and ingredients) poured in from all sides like troops advancing on a battlefield map.</p><p>Her regions are Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and the Americas. No&nbsp;prawns on the barbie, then. Europe gets the most attention: she looks at four cuisines for each of France (Normandy, Loire Valley, Lyon and Provence) and Spain (Catalonia, northern Spain, central Spain and Andalucia) and five for Italy (Lazio, Emilia-Romagna, Calabria, Sicily, Veneto). China is represented by only Cantonese and Sichuanese cooking, and the whole of Africa gets only three: Ethiopia, west Africa and Morocco (which overlaps a bit with the Middle East in any case). Still, it's unreasonable to expect this book to be able to offer much more than what its author endearingly describes as \"a scant slice of a deep and&nbsp;nuanced pie\".</p><p>Digging about in this deep and nuanced pie (may all our pies be deep&nbsp;and nuanced!), Holland is a resoundingly enthusiastic guide. She always has a kind word for the meekest of ingredients – \"the humble sesame seed\", \"the humble soybean\" and even \"the humble lettuce leaf\". Most of the chapters come enhanced with quotes from an expert in the cuisine – either a&nbsp;local, a food writer or a restaurateur; and with an epigraph from a literary production of some sort. That rounds it&nbsp;out pleasantly. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jhumpa-lahiri\" title=\"\">Jhumpa Lahiri</a> is quoted in the section on northern India; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/arundhatiroy\" title=\"\">Arundhati Roy</a> on the south. Korea brings forth references to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/psy\" title=\"\">Psy</a> and <a href=\"http://nothingtoenvy.com/\" title=\"\">Barbara Demick</a>. On German sausages Holland quotes an excellent HL Mencken passage: \"They run in size from little fellows so small and pale and fragile that it seems a crime to eat&nbsp;them, to vast and formidable pieces that look like shells for heavy artillery. And they run in flavour from the most delicate to the most raucous, and in texture from that of feathers caught in&nbsp;a cobweb to that of linoleum.\"</p><p>When we're in Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/orhanpamuk\" title=\"\">Orhan Pamuk</a>'s remark that \"colour is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a&nbsp;word out of the darkness\" sparks a little cadenza on Istanbul's \"wonderful racket of visual splendour … the breathtaking interior of the Blue Mosque, the Bosphorus shimmering at&nbsp;sunset and the coloured glass lamps that create multi-hued silhouettes on the walls of the Grand Bazaar … the mountains of dried fruits and nuts, and piles of brightly coloured spice dusts\".</p><p>Where she's visited, or even lived in, the places she's writing about, Holland puts in welcome splashes of autobiographical colour – though she stops short of giving us a chapter on the distinctive cuisine of Streatham. Some&nbsp;of these recipes are her family's. As a&nbsp;young woman in Madrid, she says, she was thwarted only in being unable to find \"good hummus and my bra size\"; we meet her friend Sophie, \"haunted by artichokes as a&nbsp;teenager\"; hear of an 11-day bike trip&nbsp;from London to Berlin (\"a mad undertaking but we did it\"); recall her arrival in California with \"one suitcase and a volume of Joan Didion's collected writing\" meet the sweary grandpa who retired to Thailand; and so on.</p><p>Intriguing little facts are scattered hither and yon. I didn't know, for instance, that yoghurt was a Turkish invention, about the travels of salt cod,&nbsp;the Iranian/Indian biriani/pilau connection, or about the contested etymology of the Vietnamese soup pho&nbsp;(possibly from the French <em>pot au feu</em>). I&nbsp;enjoyed the whimsical taxonomy of chillis – \"names that could be members of a drug cartel: guajillo, piquin, cascabel, pasilla, anch, mulato, habanero, jalapeno and chipotle\" – and the scholarly footnote on films about noodles: in addition to 2006's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780167/\" title=\"\"><em>Udon</em></a>, \"other movies with noodle-based narratives include 2008's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0806165/\" title=\"\"><em>The Ramen Girl</em></a>, in which Brittany Murphy trains to become a ramen chef, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80951/tampopo\" title=\"\"><em>Tampopo</em></a> (1985), set in a family-run noodle shop and dubbed the first 'ramen western'\".</p><p>Holland is also prepared to admit that some of the things people eat will&nbsp;sound pretty fricking disgusting to&nbsp;those of us who don't have the omnivorousness of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/anthonybourdain\" title=\"\">Anthony Bourdain</a>. \"Pajata,\" she admits in her chapter on Lazio, \"is not for the faint hearted; resembling a cheese sausage, this is an unweaned calf's intestine filled with milk chyme (its mother's milk, undigested)\". Jeepers. Can't say Korea's soondae (\"a membrane of pig intestine stuffed with pork blood and cellophane noodles\") appeals much either. Still, we can and should admire those whose appetites are more robust, following the proverbial Cantonese principle that \"anything that walks, swims, crawls or flies with its back to heaven is edible\".</p><p>To me, the most appealing aspect of&nbsp;the book is its practical emphasis on&nbsp;cooking these cuisines at home. There are recipes for two or three representative dishes, usually simple and almost always delicious-sounding, at the end of each chapter. For each cuisine Holland supplies a \"larder list\" of key ingredients that stands as an&nbsp;almost poetic shorthand for the flavours. Germany, for instance, asks&nbsp;for: \"Cabbage (red and white), sausages, potatoes, wild mushrooms, rye and pumpernickel breads, mustard, horseradish, caraway, chives, thyme, juniper berries, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon and clove for puddings.\" Holland even gives you, at the beginning, a list of essential kitchen equipment. It's probably not vital to be advised that a&nbsp;corkscrew and a kitchen radio are nice to have, but it's companionable.</p><p>Most importantly, <em>The Edible Atlas</em> makes you hungry. The epigraph to one chapter is a Japanese proverb: \"I'd rather have dumplings than flowers.\" Me too.</p>","headline":"The Edible Atlas: Around the World in 39 Cuisines – review","trailText":"<p>Fancy a bite of pajata or soondae? <strong>Sam Leith</strong> tucks in to Mina Holland's companionable guide to global gastronomy</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395245214729/apple-pie-004.jpg","wordcount":"1061","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-02T14:58:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/edible-atlas-around-world-cuisines-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/edible-atlas-around-world-cuisines-review","tags":[{"id":"books/food","webTitle":"Food and drink","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/food","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/food","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/travel-writing","webTitle":"Travel writing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/travel-writing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/travel-writing","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","webTitle":"Features & reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview/saturdayreviewsfeatres","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/guardianreview","webTitle":"Guardian review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianreview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/guardianreview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sam-leith","webTitle":"Sam Leith","r2ContributorId":"30236","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/01/20/sam_leith_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Leith the author of You Talkin' To Me?: Rhetoric from Aristotle to Obama (Profile Books)</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-leith","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sam-leith","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432570791","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395245206246/apple-pie-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Felicity Cloake","altText":"apple pie","height":"130","credit":"Felicity Cloake/Guardian","caption":"'May all your pies be deep and nuanced'.

It is so important for all children to feel represented in the books they read, in a way that doesn't feel forced or as though ethnicities are pigeonholed – publishing and promoting inclusive books is something to which we're utterly committed,\" said Marriott.</p><p></p><p>Cox agreed, stressing the importance of increasing \"the number of books relevant to cultural and racial diversity, including positive representation of Asian as well as black families\".</p><p></p><p>\"All children have the right to be included in books, to see faces that they can relate to on the covers, to meet characters with similar families, lives and experiences, and that is one of the reasons that we established Inclusive Minds. &nbsp;Equally important is for children to see&nbsp;difference in books, to learn about those who are different from themselves, and to realise that they do, in fact, have many similarities,\" said Cox.</p><p></p><p>\"Discussions about diversity in books&nbsp;are often focused exclusively on&nbsp;cultural or racial diversity, but we believe it's important to&nbsp;address&nbsp;all areas of diversity as there are so many children who aren't able to find themselves in books. Publishers are starting to become aware of this, but unfortunately stereotypes are still perpetuated, and inclusion is often forced. Our aim is to work with the publishers in order to help them develop fully-rounded characters and to make their books naturally inclusive.\"</p>","headline":"Diversity in children's books: colouring in required","trailText":"There are growing calls for young people's reading to broaden its picture of society from what is currently a depressingly monochrome view","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395314847904/Young-black-boy-007.jpg","wordcount":"858","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T11:19:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/diversity-children-books-colour-young-people","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/20/diversity-children-books-colour-young-people","tags":[{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/publishing","webTitle":"Publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/race","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/race","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432560058","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395314839433/Young-black-boy-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Alamy","altText":"Young black boy","height":"130","credit":"Alamy","caption":"Unwelcoming view … a young black boy reading.

For me, it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/fiction.reviews3\" title=\"\">Carter Beats the Devil by Glen David Gold</a>. I first read it years ago – it came out in 2001 – and I totally adore this story of the magician Charles Carter, which opens on 3 August 1923, the morning after the death of<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding\" title=\"\"> President Harding</a>, who took part in Carter's act shortly before he died.</p><p></p><p>\"Because the coroner's office could not explain exactly how Harding had died, and rumours were already starting, the men from Hearst wanted quite desperately to confirm what happened in the finale, when Carter beat the Devil,\" Gold writes. \"That afternoon, a reporter disguised himself as a delivery man and interrupted Carter's close-up practice; the magician's more sardonic tendencies, unfortunately, came out. 'At the time the president met his maker, I was in a straightjacket, upside over a steaming pit of carbonic acid. In response to your as-yet-unasked query, yes, I do have an alibi.'\"</p><p></p><p>It is wonderful; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/fiction.reviews3\" title=\"\">Peter Preston calls it</a> \"a book – a first novel, no less – to blow you away. It seeks to stun and amaze and deceive and, always, to entertain; and it seldom misses a trick in 600 pulsating pages.\"</p><p>Anyway – that's my underrated book. And you all should read it, if you haven't. I'm telling you about it because Entertainment Weekly has asked a handful of authors – Stephen King, George RR Martin, etc – for <a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/\" title=\"\">their own choices </a> of underrated titles, and I always rather like seeing what I might be missing out on.</p><p><a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/2014/03/18/stephen-king-criminally-underrated-books/#more-23882\" title=\"\">King goes for </a>The Double by George Pelecanos, Headhunters by Jo Nesbo (he calls it \"hilarious and creepy too\"), and, intriguingly, Germinal by Émile Zola, \"a terrific novel of a labor strike, as fresh now as it was a hundred years ago\", he says.</p><p></p><p>GRRM highlights the Accursed Kings series by Maurice Druon – \"All the good stuff that's in my books, minus the fantasy … but it actually happened\" – and Jack Vance's wonderful fantasy novels. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/05/fantasy-tales-dying-earth-jack-vance\" title=\"\">I love Vance too</a>; Martin<a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/2014/03/18/george-rr-martin-criminally-underrated/\" title=\"\"> tells us that </a>\"his Dying Earth stories are classics of the genre, and by rights should be as well-known and widely–read as Tolkien and Howard\".</p><p></p><p>Indeed. How can you not be tempted by his far future Earth, \"a dim place, ancient beyond knowledge. Once it was a tall world of cloudy mountains and bright rivers, and the sun was a white blazing ball. Ages of rain and wind have beaten and rounded the granite, and the sun is feeble and red. The continents have sunk and risen. A million cities have lifted towers, have fallen to dust. In the place of the old peoples a few thousand strange souls live. There is evil on Earth, evil distilled by time … Earth is dying and in its twilight.\" &nbsp;</p><p></p><p>John Green, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://shelf-life.ew.com/2014/03/18/john-green-criminally-underrated-books/\" title=\"\">plumps on EW </a> for titles including A&nbsp;Swift Pure Cry by the late Siobhan Dowd, Kindred by Octavia Butler and This Bloody Mary is the Last Thing I Own by Jonathan Rendall.</p><p></p><p>I've never read Butler, and I've been meaning to for ages, so I think I'm going to take his advice and go for Kindred. Unless you've got your own underrated masterpieces you want to tell us about? Please do share  … and perhaps we can spread the word just a little more widely about them.</p>","headline":"The underrated books whose reputation you want raised","trailText":"<strong>Alison Flood: </strong>It's Carter Beats the Devil for me; but which are the titles you always tell people they simply must get into?","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395311622791/Charles-Carter-017.jpg","wordcount":"569","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T10:16:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/20/underrated-books-reputation-raised-which-titles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/20/underrated-books-reputation-raised-which-titles","tags":[{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksblog","webTitle":"Books blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/george-rr-martin","webTitle":"George RR Martin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/george-rr-martin","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/george-rr-martin","references":[]},{"id":"books/stephenking","webTitle":"Stephen King","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/stephenking","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/stephenking","references":[]},{"id":"books/jo-nesbo","webTitle":"Jo Nesbø","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jo-nesbo","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/jo-nesbo","references":[]},{"id":"books/emilezola","webTitle":"Emile Zola","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/emilezola","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/emilezola","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432554000","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395311612502/Charles-Carter-012.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Graham Turner","altText":"Charles Carter","height":"54","credit":"Graham Turner/Guardian","caption":"Bewitching readers … detail from an original poster for magician Charles Carter.

I put on my £20 Nike wicking-fabric T-shirt and my £25 Nike wicking-fabric leggings, then my £25 compression socks and my £110 Brooks Ghost 6 shoes. I strapped on my&nbsp;£100 Garmin Forerunner 210 GPS watch, and zipped up my £40 Saucony high-vis orange windproof jacket. I inserted my iPhone into my armband, plugged in the headphones, then opened the door of my house in north Leeds and headed up Harrogate Road. I&nbsp;checked my watch every so often to see if I was keeping to my marathon pace; I stuck to the roads; and by doing what I was doing and wearing what I was wearing, I symbolised something that Richard Askwith doesn't much like. He calls it \"Big Running\", and he means the industrialisation of an activity that should be free and natural. \"How can running be an industry at all?\" he wonders early on. \"There's no more need for a running industry than there is for a tree-climbing industry or a hide-and-seek industry.\"</p><p>He strengthens this with some impressive numbers: a low-end estimate of the value of the UK's running retail industry is £425m, and globally, running is worth twice as much as football. Twice as many people work in the sports industry in England as in agriculture, forestry and fishery combined. So what? Sport is good. But&nbsp;Askwith successfully skewers the excesses of Big Running, the people in&nbsp;the sports industry who&nbsp;get runners to fall for products by sprinkling them with technobabble fairydust, such as \"stability cradle\" or \"motion control\" or \"over-pronation\". Soon, we meet a&nbsp;human version of Big&nbsp;Running: a man he sees on an&nbsp;evening run in the Peak District. Askwith has set off with no plan and no&nbsp;clue. He has run through holloways and ancient paths, and had a&nbsp;thoroughly enjoyable time. Then he&nbsp;sees a man in Day-Glo colours, grimacing in front of a&nbsp;post marked Trailblaze. And off his imagination runs, too: the other runner&nbsp;is the anti-runner, inserting his&nbsp;data into a device marketed by&nbsp;Trailblaze, a company that has since&nbsp;foundered, but whose legacy remains&nbsp;in every app and website that encourages you to share&nbsp;your latest 5K&nbsp;time, and lose yet&nbsp;more Twitter followers sick of your&nbsp;running updates.</p><p>So Big Runner is on one side, and Askwith on the other. But it wasn't always the case, as he demonstrates with his concept of the Seven Ages of&nbsp;Running. As an unfit and somewhat feckless young man, he went for a run and that was it. In the Second Age of Running, he became a pavement-pounding zealot, and in the Third, he&nbsp;chased peak performances. Pavement-pounders get short shrift: they are \"conventional road-runners\", who seem to have sacrificed enjoyment for personal bests and interval splits. Askwith ran the roads and came out the other end, and decided next to&nbsp;volunteer to be chased by bloodhounds, supervised by the pleasingly taciturn kennel-handler Graham. After&nbsp;the dogs, he turned to the fells and&nbsp;their fell‑runners, his Fourth Age of Running and the subject of his last book <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/feet-in-the-clouds-by-richard-askwith-50932.html\" title=\"\"><em>Feet in the Clouds</em></a>, voted – at least by my running club – one of the best running books ever written.</p><p>I've read a few, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/29/talk-about-running-haruki-murakami\" title=\"\">Murakami</a> to&nbsp;the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/17/running-mark-rowlands-alexandra-heminsley-review\" title=\"\"><em>Running Like a Girl</em> by Alexandra Heminsley</a>. They all have the same problem: they run their course before the end. I began to wonder whether it is possible to write interestingly about something that is, after all, just putting one foot in front of the other, at a speed of your choice. What is compelling about running is what goes on along with it: inside or outside your head. The best writers about it are writing about something else: about being alive, in Askwith's case, in predawn darkness in a Northamptonshire field; about being at&nbsp;peace with freezing rain and puddles and mud and bogs, rather than scared of them, and rather than putting up a barrier of weatherproof, waterproof health and safety against them. This is the Fifth Age of Running, though by now I've lost track. It's also what he calls Slow Running, although it's nothing to do with pace and everything to do with quality, as Slow Food is about valuing ingredients. In Slow Running, the ingredients are the outside world, and the runner's focus turns from digital numbers and Big Running kit to muntjacs and mice; to&nbsp;the ghosts of night-time animals; to&nbsp;exactly how the wind is blowing.</p><p>Askwith knows what he is doing and&nbsp;what he sounds like. He refers to his own \"sneering\". He realises that not everyone can live in a village with easy&nbsp;access to the kind of countryside he has outside his door. And he experiments with Big Running by taking part in one of the wildly popular&nbsp;obstacle races – Tough Mudder, Spartan Warrior, Warrior Dash&nbsp;– that are earning around £18m a year by appealing to people who want to spend a few hours crawling through mud and being electrocuted. I agree with him that obstacle races are rather daft: I can get my kicks from my local woods easily enough and for less than a £100 entry fee. But I see why they are popular, and so does Askwith: they are&nbsp;safe danger in an era of sanitised, risk-free lifestyles. Also, they do look like fun. I'm less lured by&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/century-old-tradition-still-going-strong-1.114159\" title=\"\">Trevelyan manhunt</a>, which Askwith also tries out. This is a secret running event in which men and women are hunted by other men and women, across the Scottish highlands. There is, I guess, a&nbsp;primal purity to it.</p><p>I may have fallen for Big Running, but Askwith's distaste for it is valid, as&nbsp;anyone who runs 20 miles then listens to people start comparing PBs, rather than exult in the power of their legs, or&nbsp;rave about the scenery, must surely agree. He offers a reminder that the simple act of&nbsp;running can return us simply but forcefully to a natural world which is just outside the door. And it doesn't matter where the door is, because this book about running is really about waking up: of a morning, but also our senses, dulled by modern cossetting. Hence the lyrical and tactile&nbsp;descriptions of his morning runs&nbsp;with his dog, carefully skirting cattle and zigzagging through sheep, in&nbsp;his one concession to fancy kit, the bizarre footwear <a href=\"http://www.vibrams.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Vibram Five Fingers</a> –&nbsp;shoes with individual toes his children call \"froggy feet\". He wants us&nbsp;to notice the small, strange or beautiful things: a&nbsp;pile of rodent bones left by some animal hunter overnight; the unexpected pleasure of running in gales, in rain, in freezing cold (tip: run frozen fingers under cold water first, unless you want chilblains). When did humans start being scared of weather? Why must rain be escaped rather than enjoyed? Even with my Big Running gear and my Big Running habits, I finished Askwith's book feeling an urgent need to run up the nearest fell, with no watch and no plan. Just me and my whistle, running free.</p>","headline":"Running Free: A Runner's Journey Back to Nature – review","trailText":"<p>Richard Askwith offers up the case against Big Running: focus on the great outdoors not the fancy footwear.

I was two years old and had been born into the anti-Vietnam war movement. I was seven when Pol Pot was toppled a few years later, and the ghastly images of the killing fields made a strong impression on me. But it was not until I moved to Cambodia in 2001 that the country turned into something of an obsession. To me this intriguing little kingdom became a way to understand the world: through the Cambodian lens many things became clearer.</p><p>My first book about Cambodia, <a href=\"http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/from-pol-pots-smile\" title=\"\">Pol Pot's Smile</a>, deals with the Khmer Rouge's devastating revolution and follows in the tracks of a Swedish delegation who travelled through the genocide without seeing anything alarming. My new book, <a href=\"http://pushkinpress.com/book/song-for-an-approaching-storm/\" title=\"\">Song for an Approaching Storm</a>, is set in the 50s, two decades before the catastrophe. The two have enabled me to spend years in Cambodia, both in the past and the present.</p><p>One might look at my following selection and ask where the contemporary Cambodian novels are. The answer, sadly, is that the authors in Cambodia are marginalised and struggling – there aren't even any publishing houses. Very little of their work is translated into English. Thus, there are many foreign authors in the following list. But good literature knows no nationality or borders.</p><h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/vann-nath-obituary\" title=\"\">A Cambodian Prison Portrait by Vann Nath</a></h2><p>There are many myths about the Khmer Rouge's bloodthirstiness and brutality, but there was at least one place where they all were real: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum\" title=\"\">Security Prison 21</a>, the secret police's killing machine. Of the 14,000 or so prisoners who were brought there for questioning, only a handful survived. One of them were the artist Vann Nath (1946-2011). In this thin little book, he describes his horrifying year behind the barbed wired walls of S-21. I had the privilege to meet him a couple of times and to me he was a man of very rare moral dignity; he resembled a Cambodian Nelson Mandela. He pitied his torturers as fellow humans, without forgiving them their deeds. This book ranks among the most important and strongest witness-stories of world literature.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/132970/sea-wall\" title=\"\">The Sea Wall by Marguerite Duras</a></h2><p>Marguerite Duras's breakthrough novel was published in 1950 and most of the elements that would become the base for her masterpiece, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/book-of-a-lifetime-the-lover-by-marguerite-duras-2362943.html\" title=\"\">The Lover</a>, more than 30 years later are already there. A fatherless French teenager, living in great poverty at a small plantation in rural Cambodia, gets involved with a much older but wealthy Chinese businessman. Age, race and class make them an impossible couple. Her mother and brother cynically tries to wring a few piastres out of the indecent affair. Less romantic and more sleazy than The Lover, but equally good.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/04/tracked-down-khmer-rouge-killer-14000\" title=\"\">The Lost Executioner by Nic Dunlop </a></h2><p>The head of S-21, Kang Kek Iew, AKA Comrade Duch, is central in this remarkable book. In 1997, the photographer and journalist Nic Dunlop more or less stumbled upon Duch, who had been hiding since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. Duch is a paradoxal figure: with a poor peasant background, he graduated as the second best student in the country. He got drawn into the Khmer Rouge and rose through the ranks. After the fall of the regime, he became a born again Christian. Dunlop's book is empathic, intelligent and a real page-turner. The monster becomes a man.</p><h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.thekeypublish.com/index.php/component/virtuemart/search\" title=\"\">Building Cambodia by Helen Grant Ross and Darryl Leon Collings</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432565285'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395235927191/The-Cambodian-National-Ol-009.jpg' alt='The Cambodian National Olympic stadium in Phnom Penh, designed by Vann Molyvann.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Cambodian National Olympic stadium in Phnom Penh, designed by Vann Molyvann. Photograph: Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In the romantic picture of the old French Indochina, there are beautifully faded colonial buildings. But in Cambodia, it is actually the structures from the following decades that are the most fascinating. Blending traditional architecture with European modernism, the then young Cambodian architects, led by the maestro Vann Molyvann, created a fascinating school, like a Cambodian Bauhaus. This short-lived movement's legacy is now being destroyed by short-sighted capitalism. But the story is well told in this book, awash with beautiful photographs.</p><h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.bookslut.com/nonfiction/2005_04_005322.php\" title=\"\">Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare by Philip Short</a></h2><p>In David Chandler's excellent biography Brother Number One from 1993, the author has an eerie feeling of being watched by the elusive and smiling dictator while he is writing the book. A decade later, Philip Short manages to drag Pol Pot out of the shadows. Where the earlier biographer had a more academic approach, Short's book reads almost like a thriller at times. The research he has put into the book is in itself mindblowing, and the result constitutes a large and important step towards understanding the Cambodian tragedy.</p><h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.travelbooks.co.uk/book_detail.asp?id=17\" title=\"\">A Dragon Apparent by Norman Lewis </a></h2><p>This modern classic was once a beautiful account of a distant place: French Indochina in its twilight. Now it is also the story of a lost world. Norman Lewis traveled through Saigon to Phnom Penh, and then via Angkor Wat on to Laos. Every person Lewis meets – monks, farmers, royalty, colonialists – become important in his or her own right; the writer's keen eye for telling detail puts the reader right beside him.</p><h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.signalbooks.co.uk/book.php?a=1904955401\" title=\"\">Phnom Penh by Milton Osborne</a></h2><p>It's easy to be seduced by Phnom Penh, but also to be exhausted, as it's overwhelming in so many ways. It is therefore most helpful to read Milton Osborne's personal and interesting cultural and literary history of this fairly new capital (permanent since 1866). Osborne arrived in 1959 and the city has since been a continuing part of his life. His book will make the bustling city more comprehensible – though it remains as overwhelming as ever.</p><h2>8. <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kwTRAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cambodian+folk+stories+from+the+gatiloke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DZQpU93cCoHAhAfMk4CgCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cambodian%20folk%20stories%20from%20the%20gatiloke&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Cambodian Folk Stories from the Gatiloke by Kong Chhean</a></h2><p>A handful of the 112 folk stories in the Gatiloke, which was used by Cambodian monks to teach their faith and committed to paper in the late 19th century. One shouldn't make too much of this mix of fables, fairytales and moral lessons, but they offer an interesting insight into some traditional Cambodian beliefs. Some of them have slapstick qualities; others draw moral conclusions that are surprising to a western reader.</p><h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.silkwormbooks.com/each_titles/e_cambodia/redbook.html\" title=\"\">Pol Pot's Little Red Book by Henri Locard </a></h2><p>This is an intriguing little book for the interested reader who has already one or two more general titles about the Khmer Rouge under his belt. Henri Locard has collected and commented on hundreds of Khmer Rouge propaganda sayings; together they open the door to the chilling and paranoid mindset the revolution created. To quote one of the most famous lines: \"To destroy you is no loss; to preserve you is no gain.\"</p><h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Faces-Han-Suyin/dp/B0007ERYAI\" title=\"\">Four Faces by Han Suyin</a></h2><p>This novel is a charming bagatelle in Han Suyin's oeuvre. The story is set in the early 60s and revolves around a farcical author congress in Siem Reap, the small, sleepy town in the shadow of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/angkorwat\" title=\"\">Angkor Wat</a>. The congress is just a facade for cold-war conspiracy and suspicion – and shady opium trafficking.

Hobbit and Lord of the Rings author's version of epic Anglo-Saxon poem fleshes out heroes' past, says son who edited manuscript","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Hwæt! Almost 90 years after JRR Tolkien translated the 11th-century poem Beowulf, The Lord of the Rings author's version of the epic story is to be published for the first time in an edition which his son Christopher Tolkien says sees his father \"enter[ing] into the imagined past\" of the heroes.</p><p>Telling of how the Geatish prince Beowulf comes to the aid of Danish king Hroðgar, slaying the monster Grendel and his mother before - spoiler alert - being mortally wounded by a dragon years later, Beowulf is is the longest epic poem in Old English, and is dated to the early 11th century. It survives in a single manuscript, housed at the British Library, and has inspired countless retellings of the myth - recently and famously by the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/seamus-heaney-beowulf-anglo-saxo\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a>, whose translation won him the Whitbread book of year award in 1999.</p><p>Tolkien himself called the story \"laden with history, leading back into the dark heathen ages beyond the memory of song, but not beyond the reach of imagination\", saying that \"the whole thing is sombre, tragic, sinister, curiously real\".</p><p>Although the author completed his own translation in 1926, he \"seems never to have considered its publication\", said Christopher Tolkien today, announcing the Tolkien estate's new deal with HarperCollins to publish Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary on 22 May. The book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, will also include the series of lectures Tolkien gave at Oxford about the poem in the 1930s, as well as the author's \"marvellous tale\", <a href=\"http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sellic_Spell\" title=\"\">Sellic Spell</a>.</p><p>Tolkien's \"creative attention to detail\" in his lectures gives rise to  a sense of the immediacy and clarity of his vision\", said his son. \"It is as if he entered into the imagined past: standing beside Beowulf and his men shaking out their mail-shirts as they beached their ship on the coast of Denmark, listening to the rising anger of Beowulf at the taunting of Unferth, or looking up in amazement at Grendel's terrible hand set under the roof of Heorot.\"</p><p>Tolkien also closely considers the dragon which would slay Beowulf, writing of how the beast was \"snuffling in baffled rage and injured greed when he discovers the theft of the cup\" – an image reminiscent of his own thief Bilbo Baggins, sneaking into the lair of the dragon Smaug in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jan/08/review-jrr-tolkien-the-hobbit\" title=\"\">The Hobbit</a> – but, said his son, the author \"rebuts the notion that this is 'a mere treasure story … just another dragon tale'\".</p><p>\"He turns to the lines that tell of the burying of the golden things long ago, and observes that it is 'the feeling for the treasure itself, this sad history' that raises it to another level,\" said Christopher Tolkien.</p><p>JRR Tolkien died in 1973,  having seen The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings achieve success, and leaving behind him a swath of previously unpublished works. Several have been released over the last few years, including his poem The Fall of Arthur, set in the last days of Arthur's reign and inspired by Geoffrey of Monmouth and Thomas Malory, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/04/jrr-tolkien-sigurd-gudrun-poem\" title=\"\">The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún</a> in 2009 and his unfinished Middle-Earth story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/jrrtolkien.fiction\" title=\"\">The Children of Húrin</a> in 2007.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.johngarth.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Garth</a>, author of Tolkien and the Great War, said the epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf had \"a deep and detailed impact on what Tolkien wrote – from his earliest poem of Middle-earth, written in September 1914, right through The Hobbit with the theft of a cup from a dragon hoard, and The Lord of the Rings with the arrival at the halls of Rohan\".</p><p>The author also, said Garth, changed attitudes to Beowulf \"completely in a 1936 talk which rescued this marvellous poem from being treated as a mere quarry for historical enquiry\".</p><p>\"It's been known for many years that Tolkien had translated the poem, and there were rumours back in 2004 that this work would be published imminently. This is long-awaited, and hugely exciting for Tolkien readers,\" said Garth.</p><p>The poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/simonarmitage\">Simon Armitage</a>, who hit the bestseller lists with his own translation of the Middle English epic poem <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/08/simonarmitage\" title=\"\">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a>, called Tolkien's Beowulf a \"tantalising prospect\", adding that the author's translation of Sir Gawain \"is a master class in linguistic chicanery – some sections of it read as older than the original! Middle English meets Middle Earth\".</p><p>\"As a Prof of Old English, Beowulf would have always been in his mind and in his sights,\" said Armitage. \"The fact that his Beowulf has slept dusty and unpublished for so long makes me wonder if he felt confident about publishing it at all. But given the current taste for his work and the film versions of his books, it will be interesting to see if it gives Heaney's Beowulf a run for its money, which was a huge bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic and seems to be regarded at the moment as the definitive contemporary version. I can already see it in Waterstones - the leather-bound, illustrated gift edition, filed next to The Hobbit and the boxed DVD Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>Beowulf opens \"Hwæt w GrDena in gar-dagum / Þod-cyninga þrym gefrnon, / H p æþelingas ellen fremedon\", lines which were translated by Heaney as \" So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by / and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. / We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns.\"</p><p>The opening, Hwæt, has <a href=\"http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/beowulf/introbeowulf.htm\" title=\"\">long foxed scholars</a>, with translations ranging from Heaney's \"so\" to \"lo\", \"hark\", \"behold\", \"attend\" and \"listen\". HarperCollins would not comment on how Tolkien approached Beowulf's famous opening, but all will be revealed come May.</p>","headline":"JRR Tolkien translation of Beowulf to be published after 90-year wait","trailText":"<p>The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings author's version of epic Anglo-Saxon poem fleshes out heroes' past, reports <strong>Alison Flood</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395228757621/JRR-Tolkien-1955-008.jpg","wordcount":"919","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-25T11:19:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/jrr-tolkien-beowulf-translation-published","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/19/jrr-tolkien-beowulf-translation-published","tags":[{"id":"books/jrrtolkien","webTitle":"JRR Tolkien","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/jrrtolkien","references":[]},{"id":"books/classics","webTitle":"Classics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/classics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/classics","references":[]},{"id":"books/poetry","webTitle":"Poetry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/poetry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fantasy","webTitle":"Fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fantasy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fantasy","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/publishing","webTitle":"Publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of The Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432471767","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395228241679/Beowulf-film-012.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Paramount Pictures","altText":"Beowulf film","height":"1200","credit":"Paramount Pictures/AP","caption":"A still from the 2007 animated film Beowulf.

It is estimated that Brooke-Hitching's example, made from a tea chest and one of about 100 printed, will fetch up to £40,000.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432507398'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/3/19/1395247948479/Daniel-Beeckman-orangutan-009.jpg' alt='Daniel Beeckman orangutan illustration' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An Indonesian orang-utan … from Daniel Beeckman's account of his trip to Borneo.

But novelists are storytellers, not history teachers, argues Stephanie Merritt<br /><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/hilary-mantel-author-booker?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel on dealing with history in fiction</a><br />","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Does historical fiction have a duty to be factually accurate? It's a question I've found myself discussing a lot lately, most recently on BBC Radio 4's Today programme with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahchurchwell\" title=\"\">Sarah Churchwell</a>, who claimed that some historical novelists use \"poetic licence\" as an excuse for sloppy or minimal research. I had a conversation on the same theme the week before at the Independent Bath Literature festival with fellow novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarah-dunant\" title=\"\">Sarah Dunant</a>, who argued forcefully that authors have a responsibility to not present readers with deliberately false information about a historical character or period, and to make clear how much they have invented.</p><p>It's certainly true that historical fiction is enjoying a boom at the moment, from heavyweight prizewinners such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/hilary-mantel-author-booker?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a> and Andrew Miller to more populist series from authors including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/26/other-queen-philippa-gregory\" title=\"\">Philippa Gregory</a>, or historical crime by the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/27/fiction.crimebooks\" title=\"\">CJ Sansom</a>, Jed Rubenfeld or my own alter ego, SJ Parris. It's also the case that for many readers, a historical novel might be their point of entry or perhaps their only real window into a particular period. Shouldn't authors therefore take care not to spread an \"incorrect\" version of what actually happened?</p><p>Well, no, in my view, although I do agree with Churchwell on the paramount importance of meticulous research. But novelists are not history teachers. It's not our job to educate people, and if we start using words like \"duty\" and \"responsibility\" about historical fiction – or any fiction – we're in danger of leaching all the vigour out of it with a sense of worthiness. A novelist has no real duty to anything except the story he or she is creating, the characters who inhabit it and whatever view of the world he or she is offering with the novel's ending. But if you are going to play fast and loose with historical fact for the sake of a good story, you'd better have done your research thoroughly if you want readers to take you seriously; only then will you have the authority to depart from those facts.</p><p>I have no problem with the idea of an author reinventing Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter, for example, as long as the fantasy is grounded in a knowledge of his biography and the book is well-written. At least it's obvious to readers that it's made up. Far more irritating to me are films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/09/drama.periodandhistorical\" title=\"\">Becoming Jane</a>, which seemed so taken with the idea of turning Jane Austen into one of her own romantic heroines that it brushed aside even the most basic understanding of Austen's life and circumstances.</p><p>I've had a reader take me to task – rightly – over an incorrect detail of clothing worn by the hero of my books, the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, even while they seemed quite happy to accept the much more flagrant invention of turning him into a spy who solves murders. Among my favourite novels as a teenager were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/03/biography.fiction\" title=\"\">Peter Ackroyd</a>'s The House of Doctor Dee and Hawksmoor, historical novels that shade into magic and fantasy, but do so from a solid foundation of knowledge of the period. I may not have learned \"accurate\" history from those books, but I acquired a love for the atmosphere of the past through the imagination of a great storyteller.</p><p>\"Histori<figure data-media-id='gu-image-432479533'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/25/1385381883969/Peter-Ackroyd-009.jpg' alt='Peter Ackroyd' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inspiration … Peter Ackroyd's novels shade into magic and fantasy, from a solid historical foundation. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure>cal fact\" is an ambiguous term. We can point to certain events taking place on certain dates – though the further back you go, the more even the dates are open to doubt – but we often don't know what was said off the record, or how the principal players behaved when the chroniclers looked away. These undocumented areas often provide the most private, human moments, away from the public stage, and the blank spaces they leave are irresistible to a novelist. Even \"straight\" biographers and historians are not above a bit of imaginative colouring-in if it brings the story to life.</p><p>The growing popularity of narrative non-fiction, together with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/11/bbc-warnings-faked-elements-documentary-hidden-kingdom\" title=\"\">the penchant for dramatising key scenes</a> in TV history documentaries, are a further reminder that stories and characters engage our imaginations beyond dates, treaties and troop movements – though in the best history and biography, you'd hope to find both.</p><p>The words \"based on\" and \"author's note\" are essential to the historical novelist's toolkit. By making clear that you're writing fiction, you claim the freedom to speculate, to stray beyond what is known, and so breathe new life into long-dead characters. Any attempt to recreate the past requires a leap of imagination. If a bit of poetic licence in historical fiction helps to keep people's interest in the past alive, so much the better.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007481194\" title=\"\">Treachery by SJ Parris</a> is published by HarperCollins</p>","headline":"How true should historical fiction be?","trailText":"From Hilary Mantel to Andrew Miller to Philippa Gregory, historical fiction is enjoying a boom.

Noting that the poems, written between 1950 and 1983, spanned the period during which Adams attended the school, she managed to track down the late author's effort.</p><p>Written in January 1970, when Adams would have been 17, the poem is entitled \"A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining\", and stretches to two pages. \"For nights I sat musing / And musing ... and musing / Whilst burning the midnight oil; / My scratchings seemed futile / My muse seemed quite mute, while / My work proved to be barren toil,\" writes the schoolboy who would go on to become one of the UK's most loved authors. \"I puzzled and thought and wrestled and fought / 'Till my midnight oil was exhausted, / So I furthered my writing by dim candle lighting, / And found, to my joy, this of course did / The trick.\"</p><p>Tragedy lies ahead for the poet, however: \"That which had ignited my literary passion, / Was about to ignite what my passion had fashion'd,\" he mourns. \"And - oh! - all was lost in a great conflagration / And I just sat there and said 'Hell and damnation'.\"</p><p>Harmer said that the long-running Candlesticks society would only allow pupils to join if they wrote, and read aloud, a poem on the subject of a candle, which was then found to be sufficiently good by current members of the literary group. \"The school at the time had various different cliques or societies,\" she said. \"At Candlesticks, which admitted only a select few, they would get together and read plays. In order to join you had to write a poem on the theme of a candle, and read it aloud, and if they liked it you were allowed in.\"</p><p>Adams's attempt was \"deemed good enough\", she said, describing the author's entry as \"a really good poem - quite witty\".</p><p>Harmer also uncovered a poem by Adams's fellow pupil Griff Rhys Jones, \"The Candle (A Lament)\", in which the comedian writes regretfully of how \"There was a time when Candle Light / Was pristine, pure and clean and bright\", but how now, \"Oh! Awful sight! / We turn to cold electric light.\"</p><p>\"Candlesticks was a group of boys who would come together and read plays, that was the point,\" <a href=\"http://www.brentwoodgazette.co.uk/Lost-poems-Griff-Rhys-Jones-Douglas-Adams/story-20823862-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Rhys Jones told local paper</a> the Brentwood Gazette, admitting he had quite forgotten his own poem.</p><p>\"There were only around 10 of us but we rather considered ourselves quite clever boys. Douglas was at the preparatory as well and even as a junior schoolboy he was given a lot of stars for his creative writing, he always used to talk about that,\" said Rhys Jones.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/15/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Adams died in May 2001</a>, aged 49, leaving behind him works including The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The only link to the great Labour victory of 1945 (when Jenkins first stood for parliament) was the vintage of the wine (Chateau Lafite) and the port (Quinta do Noval).</p><p>There are few better examples of genuine social mobility than this son and grandson of Welsh miners who became not just one of the most formidable politicians of his or any other era, but a writer whose books may well be read long after his considerable political achievements are forgotten. Jenkins was an apple who fell a fair distance from the tree.</p><p>Despite having what we would today describe as a \"back story\" worth flaunting in the inverted aristocracy of the Labour party, Jenkins resolutely refused to use it for political advantage. For some this suggested that he was ashamed of his origins; that his air of <em>de&nbsp;haut en bas</em> was a deliberate attempt to&nbsp;escape his past. But Jenkins would have considered the romantic notion that he dragged himself from the coal face to the dispatch box as fraudulent.</p><p>It was his father, Arthur Jenkins, who had navigated that route. Some readers of this marvellous biography by John Campbell will come away with mixed feelings about Jenkins junior, but few will fail to admire his father; the coal worker who took full advantage of the educational opportunities offered by his union for \"self-improvement\". Arthur was proud to say he went to Oxford but it was to Ruskin College on a scholarship rather than Balliol, where his son went to study PPE (it was a path to a political career even then).</p><p>By the time Arthur and Hattie Jenkins's only child was born in 1920 Arthur was a full-time union official on a middle-class income. Their house was away from the pit villages, with a live-in maid and a head teacher for a neighbour. Campbell describes Arthur Jenkins as \"gentle, bookish, internationalist and resolutely un-militant\". His imprisonment during the general strike was a miscarriage of justice; the nine-month sentence was soon reduced to a few weeks because of public outrage. Young Roy was told that his father was on a union visit to Germany and was bemused by the brass band and cheering crowds that welcomed him back.</p><p>By the time Roy was 14 Arthur had been elected as Labour MP for Pontypool. For seven years, during the war and beyond, he served as Attlee's parliamentary private secretary before a brief period as a junior minister. So Jenkins's childhood resembled Tony Benn's more than it resembled Nye Bevan's.</p><p>What is perhaps surprising is not Jenkins's admirable refusal to play on what his followers saw as impeccable socialist roots, but his complete lack of interest in the trade-union movement, or indeed in workers' education, given how important they'd both been to his father's advancement.</p><p>Perhaps this was an aspect of the elitism he was consistently accused of. More likely he agreed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/donald-sassoon\" title=\"\">Donald Sassoon</a>'s observation that socialists got rid of a utopian albatross when they \"abandoned the idea that a single class – the traditional male factory-based proletariat – was somehow endowed by history with the task of embodying the hope and aspiration of&nbsp;the whole of humanity\". Jenkins seems to have destroyed this albatross a little sooner than most on the left.</p><p>At the time he was seeking to climb the greasy pole, courting popularity with the unions was essential to success in the Labour party. Instead the young Welsh Gaitskellite soon earned a reputation as a gourmandising dilettante. Roy certainly enjoyed his wine (although he had an aversion to vin blanc and his passion for vin rouge was mainly confined to fine claret). Campbell doesn't attempt an assessment of his subject's daily alcohol intake (as Jenkins did in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/13/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\">his biography of Churchill</a>) but David Steel records his amazement at how much his great ally could drink at lunch, yet remain unaffected. Throughout his entire political career Jenkins set aside at least an hour and a half every day for a proper lunch with somebody he considered important and convivial. The concept of grabbing a quick sandwich was as alien to him as helping with the housework. As Campbell points out, his subject led an extraordinarily pampered life and if he had a great deal of time to read and write \"it was because there was literally nothing else he was required to do except eat, drink and talk\". Jennifer, his wife of almost 60 years, was amazingly tolerant of this and his other peccadillos.</p><p>The sexual revelations in this book have understandably attracted all the pre-publication publicity. Campbell, however, sets out masterfully the full&nbsp;range of Jenkins's achievements. Considering that he was in parliament for 16 years before his first ministerial appointment he packed an awful lot into his eight years of red boxes and ministerial cars.</p><p>He had the audacity to refuse Wilson's first offer of a cabinet post at&nbsp;education, but the gamble paid off; he&nbsp;was made home secretary instead. Education went to his close friend from Balliol, Tony Crosland. In his autobiography Denis Healey described them as being as close as <a href=\"http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_dioscuri.htm\" title=\"\">Castor and Pollux</a>, but, as Campbell reveals, they were actually much closer.</p><p>A decade later, Crosland was made foreign secretary in the Callaghan government, the job that Jenkins longed for. He decided reluctantly to leave Westminster for Brussels, only to hear of Crosland's premature death six months later. Had he stayed he would almost certainly have succeeded his old buddy.</p><p>That Jenkins and Crosland had a gay relationship at Oxford is extraordinary for two reasons. First, it is revealing that the man who used his first spell as home secretary so effectively to legalise homosexuality had actually committed the illegal offence himself. Second, Jenkins was not only heterosexual from the time he met Jennifer, he was polyamorous (a very Jenkinsonian word) throughout their marriage. Campbell lists the string of lovers who were also family friends. Jenkins would never have an affair with a woman who didn't get on with Jennifer. It was all very French. Crosland, too, took his heterosexuality seriously. After many&nbsp;lovers he married the American journalist Susan Barnes. It's said that he insisted that space in his ministerial diary be preserved for \"conjugal rights\".</p><p>Campbell's portrait belies the view of Jenkins as a lazy hedonist. He certainly didn't fit Healey's depiction of him as Dickens's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-mutual-friend\" title=\"\">Mr Podsnap</a>. It's true that he had a mannered speaking style, forged in the debating chamber of the Oxford Union: one hand in jacket pocket, the other twisting and writhing in front of him like a snake, as one of his colleagues observed. (A senior Labour figure who knew him well once told me it was as if&nbsp;he were standing behind a buxom wench gently cupping her breast.)</p><p>He was also an extremely shy man but, reading this book, nobody could doubt his diligence or indeed his courage. When he went to defend his cabinet colleague Reg Prentice who was under threat of de-selection in Newham, extremists of right and left hijacked the&nbsp;meeting and turned it into a brawl. Jenkins was hit full on by a flour bomb thrown by a National Front thug. He refused to allow the police to be called and made a rousing speech looking like one of the Homepride men.</p><p>Few politicians can match Jenkins's achievements. In two periods as home secretary he pursued the cause of \"equal opportunity accompanied by cultural diversity in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance\" that he saw as essential to civilised living and social cohesion. As chancellor he \"righted the ship\" after Callaghan's devaluation and as deputy leader he remained consistent in his vision for Britain in Europe when his senior colleagues were performing screeching U-turns. In leading a rebellion by 79 Labour MPs he ensured an emphatic pro-European majority of 112 in a crucial parliamentary debate in October 1971.</p><p>By helping to create the SDP Jenkins believed he saved the Labour party from the Bennite madness of the early 80s. Others (including me) believe he should have stayed to fight alongside those who were determined to save Labour from the clutches of what Attlee once described as \"doctrinaire impossibleism\".</p><p>Had he stayed he would never have&nbsp;been leader, as he was of the SDP. He&nbsp;struggled in the world of 24-hour media and was too shy to go back-slapping. Neither would he have been&nbsp;–&nbsp;as he was following the 1982 byelection – the rather incongruous MP&nbsp;for Glasgow Hillhead (when asked if he&nbsp;would live in the constituency, he calmly explained that while he already owned two houses he would certainly consider acquiring a \"wesidency\" in the city). But he would, I am sure, have accelerated the process of reform and renewal that led to Labour becoming electable again.</p><p>The highest praise I can give to John Campbell's biography is that Roy Jenkins would have been proud to have been its author.</p><p>• Alan Johnson MP is a former home secretary.

Askwith offers up the case against Big Running: focus on the great outdoors not the fancy footwear","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Today I went for a run. I put on my £20 Nike wicking-fabric T-shirt and my £25 Nike wicking-fabric leggings, then my £25 compression socks and my £110 Brooks Ghost 6 shoes. I strapped on my&nbsp;£100 Garmin Forerunner 210 GPS watch, and zipped up my £40 Saucony high-vis orange windproof jacket. I inserted my iPhone into my armband, plugged in the headphones, then opened the door of my house in north Leeds and headed up Harrogate Road. I&nbsp;checked my watch every so often to see if I was keeping to my marathon pace; I stuck to the roads; and by doing what I was doing and wearing what I was wearing, I symbolised something that Richard Askwith doesn't much like. He calls it \"Big Running\", and he means the industrialisation of an activity that should be free and natural. \"How can running be an industry at all?\" he wonders early on. \"There's no more need for a running industry than there is for a tree-climbing industry or a hide-and-seek industry.\"</p><p>He strengthens this with some impressive numbers: a low-end estimate of the value of the UK's running retail industry is £425m, and globally, running is worth twice as much as football. Twice as many people work in the sports industry in England as in agriculture, forestry and fishery combined. So what? Sport is good. But&nbsp;Askwith successfully skewers the excesses of Big Running, the people in&nbsp;the sports industry who&nbsp;get runners to fall for products by sprinkling them with technobabble fairydust, such as \"stability cradle\" or \"motion control\" or \"over-pronation\". Soon, we meet a&nbsp;human version of Big&nbsp;Running: a man he sees on an&nbsp;evening run in the Peak District. Askwith has set off with no plan and no&nbsp;clue. He has run through holloways and ancient paths, and had a&nbsp;thoroughly enjoyable time. Then he&nbsp;sees a man in Day-Glo colours, grimacing in front of a&nbsp;post marked Trailblaze. And off his imagination runs, too: the other runner&nbsp;is the anti-runner, inserting his&nbsp;data into a device marketed by&nbsp;Trailblaze, a company that has since&nbsp;foundered, but whose legacy remains&nbsp;in every app and website that encourages you to share&nbsp;your latest 5K&nbsp;time, and lose yet&nbsp;more Twitter followers sick of your&nbsp;running updates.</p><p>So Big Runner is on one side, and Askwith on the other. But it wasn't always the case, as he demonstrates with his concept of the Seven Ages of&nbsp;Running. As an unfit and somewhat feckless young man, he went for a run and that was it. In the Second Age of Running, he became a pavement-pounding zealot, and in the Third, he&nbsp;chased peak performances. Pavement-pounders get short shrift: they are \"conventional road-runners\", who seem to have sacrificed enjoyment for personal bests and interval splits. Askwith ran the roads and came out the other end, and decided next to&nbsp;volunteer to be chased by bloodhounds, supervised by the pleasingly taciturn kennel-handler Graham. After&nbsp;the dogs, he turned to the fells and&nbsp;their fell‑runners, his Fourth Age of Running and the subject of his last book <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/feet-in-the-clouds-by-richard-askwith-50932.html\" title=\"\"><em>Feet in the Clouds</em></a>, voted – at least by my running club – one of the best running books ever written.</p><p>I've read a few, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/29/talk-about-running-haruki-murakami\" title=\"\">Murakami</a> to&nbsp;the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/17/running-mark-rowlands-alexandra-heminsley-review\" title=\"\"><em>Running Like a Girl</em> by Alexandra Heminsley</a>. They all have the same problem: they run their course before the end. I began to wonder whether it is possible to write interestingly about something that is, after all, just putting one foot in front of the other, at a speed of your choice. What is compelling about running is what goes on along with it: inside or outside your head. The best writers about it are writing about something else: about being alive, in Askwith's case, in predawn darkness in a Northamptonshire field; about being at&nbsp;peace with freezing rain and puddles and mud and bogs, rather than scared of them, and rather than putting up a barrier of weatherproof, waterproof health and safety against them. This is the Fifth Age of Running, though by now I've lost track. It's also what he calls Slow Running, although it's nothing to do with pace and everything to do with quality, as Slow Food is about valuing ingredients. In Slow Running, the ingredients are the outside world, and the runner's focus turns from digital numbers and Big Running kit to muntjacs and mice; to&nbsp;the ghosts of night-time animals; to&nbsp;exactly how the wind is blowing.</p><p>Askwith knows what he is doing and&nbsp;what he sounds like. He refers to his own \"sneering\". He realises that not everyone can live in a village with easy&nbsp;access to the kind of countryside he has outside his door. And he experiments with Big Running by taking part in one of the wildly popular&nbsp;obstacle races – Tough Mudder, Spartan Warrior, Warrior Dash&nbsp;– that are earning around £18m a year by appealing to people who want to spend a few hours crawling through mud and being electrocuted. I agree with him that obstacle races are rather daft: I can get my kicks from my local woods easily enough and for less than a £100 entry fee. But I see why they are popular, and so does Askwith: they are&nbsp;safe danger in an era of sanitised, risk-free lifestyles. Also, they do look like fun. I'm less lured by&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/century-old-tradition-still-going-strong-1.114159\" title=\"\">Trevelyan manhunt</a>, which Askwith also tries out. This is a secret running event in which men and women are hunted by other men and women, across the Scottish highlands. There is, I guess, a&nbsp;primal purity to it.</p><p>I may have fallen for Big Running, but Askwith's distaste for it is valid, as&nbsp;anyone who runs 20 miles then listens to people start comparing PBs, rather than exult in the power of their legs, or&nbsp;rave about the scenery, must surely agree. He offers a reminder that the simple act of&nbsp;running can return us simply but forcefully to a natural world which is just outside the door. And it doesn't matter where the door is, because this book about running is really about waking up: of a morning, but also our senses, dulled by modern cossetting. Hence the lyrical and tactile&nbsp;descriptions of his morning runs&nbsp;with his dog, carefully skirting cattle and zigzagging through sheep, in&nbsp;his one concession to fancy kit, the bizarre footwear <a href=\"http://www.vibrams.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Vibram Five Fingers</a> –&nbsp;shoes with individual toes his children call \"froggy feet\". He wants us&nbsp;to notice the small, strange or beautiful things: a&nbsp;pile of rodent bones left by some animal hunter overnight; the unexpected pleasure of running in gales, in rain, in freezing cold (tip: run frozen fingers under cold water first, unless you want chilblains). When did humans start being scared of weather? Why must rain be escaped rather than enjoyed? Even with my Big Running gear and my Big Running habits, I finished Askwith's book feeling an urgent need to run up the nearest fell, with no watch and no plan. Just me and my whistle, running free.</p>","headline":"Running Free: A Runner's Journey Back to Nature – review","trailText":"<p>Richard Askwith offers up the case against Big Running: focus on the great outdoors not the fancy footwear.

Nevertheless, I can't help but notice that we're in the midst of a sudden rash of books about books; I've read three in the past two months alone. The latest of these is by <a href=\"http://rebeccamead.com/\" title=\"\">Rebecca Mead</a>, a writer at the <em>New Yorker</em>, who has turned an essay she once wrote about her love for George Eliot's novel <em>Middlemarch</em> into a full-blown hymn of adoration comprising a lot of biography, a little literary criticism, and a teeny-tiny drop of memoir. Yes. What I'm trying to say is that if there is anything new in this book, I'm damned if I can find it.</p><p>But this is unfair. Mead didn't set out to hurl a boulder into the tranquil pond of Eliot scholarship. A passionate reader, it's her conviction that when a person is truly \"grasped\" by a book, it does not feel like an escape from life but a vital dimension of life itself: \"There are some books that seem to comprehend us just as much as we understand them, or even more. There&nbsp;are books that grow with the reader as the reader grows, like a graft to a tree.\" Mead first read <em>Middlemarch</em>&nbsp;as a teenager in the seaside town from which she longed to escape (\"Oxford was the immediate goal, but anywhere would do\"). She fell&nbsp;for it hard – she couldn't believe how \"relevant\" it felt, and sought to identify herself with the intelligence she found within its pages – and she has returned to it regularly ever since, each visit enriched both by her experiences, and by the memories it stirs. In the bustle of Brooklyn, it takes her back not only to the English landscapes of her childhood, but to the \"intensity and imagination of beginnings\". Its influence on her has been profound. She believes – oh, crikey – that <em>Middlemarch</em> has \"disciplined\" her character.</p><p>Wanting to pass on the baton, or perhaps to offer kinship to those whose feelings for Eliot's masterpiece of provincial life are similarly ardent, she sets out to unpick the novel's themes of marriage, ambition and familial responsibility and to connect its most important crises and dilemmas to points both in its author's life, and her own. The result is somewhat laboured, for all that Mead knits her material together with great skill and in prose that is always lucid and sometimes soaringly beautiful. A long precis of a section of <em>Middlemarch</em> will be followed by a disquisition in which she ponders the inspiration for the doomed marriage of Dorothea Brooke and her deluded academic husband, Edward Casaubon (most likely Mark Pattison, the rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, and his wife Emilia Francis), or Eliot's relationship with her stalker-like Scottish fan, Alexander Main (as a concession to his epistolary attentions, Eliot allowed him to edit the mawkishly titled <em>Wise, Witty, and Tender Sayings, in Prose and Verse, Selected from the Works of George Eliot</em>), or the writer's feelings for the sons of her beloved companion, George Henry Lewes (Eliot did not meet Lewes until she was, by Victorian standards, middle-aged, and Mead sees her \"unexpected\" family as a key influence on <em>Middlemarch</em>'s \"tensile\" strength). All this is punctuated with visits to places connected with Eliot – to Nuneaton, close to which she was born, and to Coventry, where she later lived with her father – and a few snatched glimpses of Mead's own life: the flight to Oxford and thence to New York; a love affair that goes wrong; marriage and motherhood.</p><p><em>The Road to Middlemarch</em> is an intensely sincere book. It wears its earnestness like Sunday best, only rarely cracking a smile, and thanks to this, it feels brutal to criticise it, particularly if you're also, as I am, a lover of <em>Middlemarch</em>. But I'd be lying if I said it spoke to me. Who is it for? If a writer is going to rely wholly on the scholarship of others – Mead owes a great debt to Eliot's biographer <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/english/staff/rosemary-ashton\" title=\"\">Rosemary Ashton</a>, and to many others – then she must bring something else to the library: a new angle, an outrageous opinion or, ideally, a surplus of style. As I read, I longed for the loopy wit and dogged honesty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/01/working-room-essays-geoff-dyer-review\" title=\"\">Geoff Dyer</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780857862341\" title=\"\">book on DH Lawrence</a> is such a peculiar marvel (and I loathe DH Lawrence). The element of memoir in <em>The Road to Middlemarch</em> is so coy as to be pointless; its travelogues are pedantic and obvious (it's hardly surprising that Coventry has changed, or that the Strand in London, where Eliot lived as a young woman, is now awash with pizza chains). Above all, Mead's reverence for her favourite writer is sometimes just too much. \"I feel defensive on her behalf,\" she writes at one point – and, boy, does she mean it. Late on, she quotes from a letter Eliot wrote on her honeymoon in 1879 (to the horror of many, Eliot married John Walter Cross, a friend 20 years her junior, shortly after Lewes's death), in which the writer complains about the \"disgustingly coarse Belgians with baboonish children\" with whom she was obliged to share a railway carriage. Disgustingly? Coarse? Baboons? Mead is disappointed. It is, she writes, \"surprising and difficult to find Eliot so unappealing in moments like these\". Is it? Leaving aside the fact that it's something of a relief to hear Eliot sounding a regular person rather than a paragon of virtue, it's hard not to worry for Mead at this point. The Lord knows how she must feel about writers with more… difficult personalities: Dickens, Larkin, Patricia Highsmith. Is she even able to read them? Virginia Woolf must have her rushing for the smelling salts.</p><p>Her reading of <em>Middlemarch</em> is close, generous and intelligent. There's wisdom in her analysis of the flaws and strengths of Dorothea, Rosamond, Mary, Ladislaw, Fred and all the rest; I&nbsp;appreciated her refusal to judge, to see the light and shade even in Casaubon (Mead is surely right to insist&nbsp;that the older one grows, the more one sees the fear in Dorothea's wretched husband as well as the pomposity). In turn, this reminds us of the wisdom of their creator, at least in terms of what she put on the page. But it's wrong to want Eliot herself always to be a veritable owl of morality, kindness and sense. <em>Middlemarch</em> is the best of her, not a facsimile of her soul.</p><p>As for reading a novel as if it were a manual, though I've often been guilty of this myself, one must be wary. Isn't it just a more intellectual version of the dreary argument that insists a book cannot be enjoyed unless the reader \"likes the characters\"? I admire Mead's ambition, her chutzpah: there's daring in appropriating a masterpiece like this. But sometimes she makes <em>Middlemarch</em>, that most capacious of stories, seem a lot smaller than it is.</p><p><em>Rebecca Mead is speaking at Foyles in Cabot Circus, Bristol, as part of the </em><a href=\"http://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/2014/events/rebecca-mead/\" title=\"\"><em>Bristol festival of ideas</em></a><em>, on Thursday 20 March</em> <em> </em></p>","headline":"The Road to Middlemarch review – Rebecca Mead's overly earnest thoughts on a masterpiece","trailText":"<p>Rebecca Mead's highly personal tribute to George Eliot's Middlemarch lacks wit and brio, writes <strong>Rachel Cooke</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/10/1394460119068/road-to-middlemarch-eliot-006.jpg","wordcount":"1190","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-05T22:59:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/road-to-middlemarch-review-rebecca-mead","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/16/road-to-middlemarch-review-rebecca-mead","tags":[{"id":"books/literary-criticism","webTitle":"Literary criticism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-criticism","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/literary-criticism","references":[]},{"id":"books/georgeeliot","webTitle":"George Eliot","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/georgeeliot","references":[]},{"id":"books/autobiography-and-memoir","webTitle":"Autobiography and memoir","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rachelcooke","webTitle":"Rachel Cooke","rcsId":"GNL483982","r2ContributorId":"16301","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/18/1268913463910/Rachel-Cooke.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachelcooke","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/rachelcooke","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/books","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432126651","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/10/1394460089651/road-to-middlemarch-eliot-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Rex Features","photographer":"Minke Spiro","altText":"road to middlemarch eliot","height":"54","credit":"Minke Spiro/Rex Features","caption":"Rufus Sewell and Juliet Aubrey in Andrew Davies’s 1994 TV adaptation of George Eliot’s Middlemarch.

Henry Marsh has written a memoir of startling candour","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>We go to doctors for help and healing; we don't expect them to make us worse. Most people know the aphorism taught to medical students, attributed to the ancient Greek <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/jan/23/healthandwellbeing.health\" title=\"\">Hippocrates</a> but timeless in its quiet sanity: \"First, do no harm.\" But many medical treatments do cause harm: learning how to navigate the risks of drug therapies, as well as the catastrophic consequences of botched or inadvised surgical operations, is a big part of why training doctors takes so long. Even the simplest of therapies carries the risk of making things worse. Drugs such as statins that lower cholesterol might reduce your risk of&nbsp;stroke or heart attack, but they also&nbsp;stiffen your muscles and inflame your liver. Drugs to thin your blood against clots run the risk of devastating haemorrhage. Operations to remove prostate&nbsp;cancer might leave you impotent and incontinent; removing a&nbsp;gall bladder can ruin your digestion. The most dangerous speciality is widely considered to be neurosurgery. When a&nbsp;surgeon meddles with your brain it's not just incontinence or bad digestion you risk but coma, paralysis and death.</p><p>Brain surgeons such as Henry Marsh, the author of this startling and moving memoir, have to live, breathe, operate and make urgent decisions in full awareness of a terrible dilemma: if they&nbsp;open the skull they might save the patient's life, but a slip of the scalpel can cause appalling disability, which, as Marsh puts it, can be much worse than death. I worked as a junior neurosurgical trainee once, at the bottom of what he calls \"the strict medical hierarchy\", and realised then that living with such responsibility is not just onerous, it utterly transforms the lives of those who bear it. It's understandable that it should be demanding: most of us, if we were to have our brains cut open, would prefer it be done by someone who prioritises their work over their personal life. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;trainee I realised that I had too many other interests to be a good neurosurgeon, and quit for emergency medicine – a tranquil backwater by comparison. Readers of this book, as well as the thousands of patients Marsh has treated over his career can be&nbsp;thankful that he did not.</p><p>He describes visiting a nursing home in the countryside outside London, run by Catholic nuns and dedicated to&nbsp;the long-term care of patients with catastrophic brain damage. Walking along the quiet, orderly corridors he recognised \"at least five\" of the names on the door plaques as those of former patients of his – the home is like a museum of his operative failures. Cut&nbsp;by cut, chapter by chapter, he takes&nbsp;the reader through many of these &nbsp;\"failures\", and the well appreciated risks he and his patients knew they were taking, as well as behind the closed doors of a successful malpractice suit made against him. Passing a young colleague in the intensive care unit, just after visiting a&nbsp;patient rendered comatose through surgery, he remarks: \"Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don't do it.\" It's this disarming candour that makes the book such an enthralling read. Marsh is&nbsp;not interested in giving us a glossed image of the brain surgeon as superman; he wants to shows us the dreadful pressures under which he has lived throughout his professional life.</p><p>A friendly orthopaedic surgeon, called in to set Marsh's broken leg, pities him for his choice of career. \"Neurosurgery,\" he says, \"is all doom and gloom.\" But this is not a gloomy book, it is a testimony of wonder – the wonder Marsh has felt through being able to operate on the brain. Many of the chapters describe his triumphs, and, in intricate and fascinating detail, his daily work. As a junior surgeon the first procedure he witnessed was to clip an aneurysm – a pathological weakening of a brain artery that, if it ruptures, can cause paralysis or death. The operation seemed to him charged with meaning and set him off on his career. \"What could be finer, I thought, than to be a neurosurgeon?\" he writes. \"The operation involved the brain, the&nbsp;mysterious substrate of all thought and feeling, of all that was important in&nbsp;human life – a mystery, it seemed to me, as great as the stars at night and the universe around us.\" The wonder doesn't leave him: decades later, separating two lobes at the back of the&nbsp;brain, he reveals the pineal gland, which Descartes believed to be the seat&nbsp;of the soul. It is \"a secret and mysterious area where all the most vital functions that keep us conscious and alive are to be found. Above me, like the great arches of a cathedral roof,&nbsp;are the deep veins of the brain …&nbsp;this is anatomy that inspires awe in&nbsp;neurosurgeons.\"</p><p>But if this book is about wonder, it is&nbsp;also about entitlement. Exhilarated after performing a successful and protracted life-saving operation one day, he confesses how irritating it was to have to stand in the queue at the supermarket: \"'What did you do today?' I felt like asking them, annoyed that an important neurosurgeon like myself should be kept waiting.\" This plea for special treatment would come across as insufferably self-important were it not balanced by Marsh's awareness of how pompous he can sound. We're also given to understand that by living so long under the seismic pressure of such responsibility, Marsh has earned himself some privileges.</p><p>It's the incremental stripping of those privileges that take up the final quarter of the book; his sense as he approaches retirement that he is expected to bow before the management newspeak, health and safety directives and \"clinical governance protocols\" that are overwhelming the modern NHS – initiatives that no one understands and&nbsp;that do nothing for patient care. He&nbsp;describes wards full of agency staff who don't know where his patients are,&nbsp;or hours spent trying to find brain scans lost by the latest computer system. Government meddling has made his clinical career into a game of&nbsp;musical chairs, he says. The coalition has taken this one step further: not content just to pull away resources, it&nbsp;keeps on changing the orchestra.</p><p>Marsh's style is admirably clear, concise and precise, as you'd expect from someone accustomed to writing operation and clinic notes in a hurry. It is unexpectedly honest on a range of controversial issues facing the modern health service, even as Marsh expresses his relief that he's about to retire from it.&nbsp;It&nbsp;touches on the way greed leads some&nbsp;surgeons to perform ill-advised operations in private practice, as well&nbsp;as the corrupting influence of Big&nbsp;Pharma (Marsh's charitable work in Ukraine has shown him how drug trials are often fixed by corrupt and desperate physicians). There is no forcing of a narrative arc or a happy ending, just the quotidian frustrations, sorrows, regrets and successes of neurosurgical life. \"They call us heroes, and sometimes gods,\" Marsh writes of his patients. \"Perhaps they never quite realised just how dangerous the operation had been and how lucky they were to have recovered so well. Whereas the surgeon, for a while, has known heaven, having come&nbsp;very close to hell.\"</p><p>• Gavin Francis's <em>Empire Antarctica</em> was shortlisted in&nbsp;the Costa book awards.

Did no one warn Mrs Cooke to be careful what she wished for? Had she any inkling of the family cataclysm her&nbsp;innocent desire would engender, and the complex repercussions her daughter would suffer in its wake?</p><p>Rewind to the day back in 1970s Indiana, when narrator-heroine Rosemary is separated from her beloved \"twin\" sister, Fern, and sent, aged five, for a week's visit to her grandparents. \"I knew the winds of doom when they blew,\" Rosemary recalls. She senses that she has committed a heinous crime, for which her punishment is expulsion from the bosom of the family. But no. On her return, it is the&nbsp;thrill-seeking Fern who has been dispatched – never to be seen again. There are no explanations.</p><p>Soon afterwards, Rosemary's stormy teenage brother Lowell absconds, also without discussion, leaving her bereft again. When he commits a series of crimes in the name of animal rights and becomes a fugitive from the FBI, a&nbsp;second hole is blasted in the already shaken family. More silence follows and little motormouth Rosemary, recognising a double taboo when she sees one, packs away her enthusiastically learned vocabulary and becomes an almost silent child. In&nbsp;time, she will be left with only a&nbsp;baffling palimpsest of sibling memories, recounted through caustic, guilt-tinged flashbacks. So far, so normal-ish. But \"weird on stilts\" lies just over the horizon.</p><p>There's no way of reviewing this novel without disclosing the shattered Cooke family's not-so-secret secret, deftly held back until page 77: that Rosemary's missing sister, Fern, was a&nbsp;chimpanzee. The girls' imposed \"twin‑sisterhood\" was part of an animal-human behaviour experiment conducted for five years by their psychologist father, before being abruptly terminated.</p><p><em>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</em> resonates with Rosemary's grief for her missing alter ego and sister, and for the adored Lowell, who communicates with the family only through the occasional cryptic postcard. But it's Rosemary's problems as a young adult – informed by her \"simian\" past – that shape the narrative. Who and what is she?</p><p>\"Most home-raised chimps, when asked to sort photographs into piles of&nbsp;chimps and humans, make only the&nbsp;one mistake of putting their own picture into the human pile. This is exactly what Fern did,\" Rosemary recalls. \"What seems not to have been anticipated was my own confusion.\"</p><p>The nickname \"Monkey-girl\" dogs Rosemary's school years, and her deep-rooted identity dysmorphia sets her apart from her fellow students at college, where she is keen to shake off&nbsp;\"the uncanny valley response\" that her&nbsp;off-kilter body language elicits in others. While room-mates swap horror stories about their tamely freakish families, Rosemary knows better than to join in: her own background is a room-silencer.</p><p>But she can't act normal for long. Soon she has hurtled headlong into a dangerous friendship with manic wild-child Harlow, a drama student with Honorary Chimp and Fern Substitute written all over her in giant letters. Drunken capers with a purloined Madame Defarge puppet and a paranoid apartment janitor ensue. For what better way to defy the gravitational pull of psychic pain than to cavort madly beyond its stratosphere?</p><p>In lesser hands, such whirlwind antics might juxtapose oddly with the profound questions the novel raises about animal rights, sibling loyalty, parental subterfuge, self-delusion, guilt and the notion of ownership. But Fowler is neither kooky or didactic: her narrative flits adeptly between registers, mixing pleasure and pain with all the naughty chutzpah of a chimp twizzling a feather duster. And while one family's breakdown, rooted in an act of injustice, forms the bedrock of this astonishing work, the novel's real triumph is that the repercussions of the Cooke parents' broken pact with their chimpanzee child extend, by association, to the family of man and its dysfunctional relationship with the entire zoosphere.</p><p>Many a novel has devoted itself to exploring variations of Larkin's lament about what mums and dads do to their kids. But if any other book has done it as exhilaratingly as the achingly funny, deeply serious heart-breaker that is Fowler's 10th novel, and made it ring true for the whole of mankind, I've yet to read it.

What is – was – the present? Is the future shaped and fixed, or does every individual action make a tiny adjustment to God's grand plan for us? And when does the past become The Past? Just how much time must elapse before what was once the mundane present becomes transformed, becomes transfigured, into that recent antiquity that exists magically in our memory, a luminous, indeed numinous, place, where everything that happened takes on an import and significance far beyond anything that attached to it when it was happening in the here and now? Is the past remembered, or imagined?</p><p>In this lovingly detailed account of childhood days in Bouillon, a small Belgian town just across the border from France, <a href=\"http://www.patrickmcguinness.org.uk\" title=\"\">Patrick McGuinness</a> is refreshingly free of sentimentality and that tendency towards Proustian rhapsodising that mar so many such memoirs. His version of the past has a uniquely poetical matter-of-factness and exactitude; it's also very funny, in its fondly quiet way. The people among whom he grew up, his Belgian great-grandparents, grandparents, his uncles and aunts, inculcated in him a lesson that, as a writer, he wisely took to heart:</p><p>\"'Fais pas la comédie', they'd say: \"lay off the dramatics\".' And so he does, though the muted style that he employs communicates his sense of a lost past, and the beloved people who inhabit it, with deep feeling and remarkable vividness.</p><p>A lecturer in French at St Anne's College, Oxford, McGuinness has published a novel, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781854115416\" title=\"\"><em>The Last Hundred Days</em></a>, which was longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2011, and two volumes of poetry. And it is with a poem that he begins, recalling the days before television came along to emblue our evenings and</p><p><em>there were firesides filtered through net curtains, shadows</em></p><p><em>pulling free from shadows. The furniture didn't furnish,</em></p><p><em>it loomed; heavy as cannon, it boomed darkness.</em></p><p>When it comes to childhood, he writes, \"I think mostly of rooms\", and his book has the liminal yet limpid quality of one of Vermeer's mysteriously compelling interiors. His childhood \"feels more real to me now than it did then\", for, as he puts it, \"I spent most of my childhood with a foretaste of its pastness in my mouth.\"</p><p>His book, he tells us, had its origins in stories he used to tell his own children about the world of Bouillon – the name seems made up, but it is not – in which he spent his childhood. His mother's family, the Lejeunes, were small-town folk, his grandfather, the determinedly laconic Eugène, a metalworker, and his grandmother, Lucie, a dressmaker. These people lived what Seamus Heaney, speaking of his own boyhood in County Derry, described as \"a den life\", and the book exudes a wonderfully fragrant mustiness; in these closed rooms the ticking of time is hardly perceptible, and \"slow and curdled, there was a thickness to the minutes\".</p><p>Yet the little town had its moments. Rimbaud and Verlaine, \"two famous Ardennais\", used to lodge in the Hotel des Ardennes, where McGuinness's great-great grandmother worked as a chambermaid, and most probably changed the renegade poets' bed linen, a matter which McGuinness, surely wisely, does not dwell upon. It fascinates him, though, to think of his not so distant ancestors catching sight of this exotic pair, \"Verlaine with his Mongol dome… and beside him a slut-faced adolescent boy he sometimes called his wife…\"</p><p>There were darker denizens of the place. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Degrelle\" title=\"\">Léon Degrelle</a>, for instance, \"fabulist, liar, vainglorious fantasist, fascist dandy\", was leader of the Rexists, the Belgian Nazi movement before the second world war, and led a collaborationist battalion, the Légion&nbsp;Wallonie, which fought alongside the German army, with great bravery, it must be said, Degrelle becoming the most decorated foreign soldier in the Wehrmacht. After the war, he fled to Spain, and lived out the rest of his days in Malaga, where he \"enjoyed six decades of insolently good&nbsp;health, and made no attempt to hide or go underground\", remaining to the end an unrepentant Nazi and Holocaust-denier.</p><p>McGuinness's grandparents, Eugène&nbsp;and Lucie, are the two most imposing figures in his book, though in life what imposing they did was of the lightest and most diffident kind. \"Eugène ailed. For most of my childhood that seemed to be his job, his &nbsp;second career: to ail emphysemically, peeling potatoes and&nbsp;playing cards in the kitchen on a red formica table.\" In the times between&nbsp;looking after Eugène, Lucie&nbsp;was at her sewing machine, copying for the richer ladies of the town items of Parisian haute couture from magazine photographs. She also&nbsp;made suits for young Patrick, being particularly attentive to the quality and shade of the&nbsp;linings. \"I think,\" McGuinness writes, \"Lucie must&nbsp;have&nbsp;sewn a lining into time itself,&nbsp;because when I'm in her house I&nbsp;find myself feeling my way inside it for a whole life I hid there years before.\"</p><p>McGuinness is a marvellous writer – literally, his book is filled with marvels – who, in John Updike's formulation, gives the ordinary its beautiful due. The world that is conjured in <em>Other People's Countries</em> is clear, palpable and distant, like a view seen through the wrong end of a telescope. On every page there are breathtakingly gorgeous images, similes, metaphors. From this hoard of everyday treasures let us have one, which combines many of the book's preoccupations: the passing of time, the murky beauty of a lost world, those&nbsp;dim and faintly scented rooms where the past still somehow survives.&nbsp;The author is recalling the autumn rains that would swell the little river that held the town in its meandering embrace. \"The mud of the riverbank becomes lustrous and tender, the river rises and there's a brown translucent froth that trembles like a hem of dirty lace at the edges of the water. It's like looking through the window of an old house, trying to make out the slow, half-lit stirrings behind the pane.\"</p>","headline":"Other People's Countries review – memory lane, lovingly explored","trailText":"<p>Poet and novelist Patrick McGuinness's lyrical recollection of his childhood takes <strong>John Banville</strong>'s breath away</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394214241019/-A-marvellous-writer--Pat-004.jpg","wordcount":"972","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-04-06T11:24:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/17/other-peoples-countries-memory-lane-explored-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/mar/17/other-peoples-countries-memory-lane-explored-review","tags":[{"id":"books/autobiography-and-memoir","webTitle":"Autobiography and memoir","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/john-banville","webTitle":"John Banville","r2ContributorId":"44014","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-banville","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/john-banville","references":[]},{"id":"books/biography","webTitle":"Biography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/biography","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/biography","references":[]},{"id":"science/memory","webTitle":"Memory","type":"keyword","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/memory","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/science/memory","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/books","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432114813","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394214235358/-A-marvellous-writer--Pat-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR","photographer":"Barney Jones","altText":"‘A marvellous writer’: Patrick McGuinness.","height":"54","credit":"Barney Jones/PR","caption":"‘A marvellous writer’: Patrick McGuinness.
