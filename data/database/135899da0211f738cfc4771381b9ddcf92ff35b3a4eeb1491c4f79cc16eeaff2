        "headline":"The science of hangovers",
        "body":"<p>Most of us will have been there at some point. The pounding headache, nausea, vomiting, maybe a nondescript feeling of anxiety (often accurately dubbed &ldquo;the horrors&rdquo;). The hangover experience does not paint a pretty picture, yet time and again, especially over the festive season, we succumb to overindulgence.</p> <p>Given that it is an age-old ailment, the anatomy of a hangover is not scientifically well understood. Very little is known about the physiology, effects, prevention and treatment of alcohol-induced hangover. Whilst tens of thousands of peer-reviewed articles have been published on the acute effects of alcohol intoxication, only a few hundred papers investigate the effects of hangover. Of these articles, there is mixed evidence for a variety of factors that determine how we may react differently to alcohol and hangover.</p> <p>It can often feel that there are no hard and fast rules for working out when a hangover will strike. We might use anecdotal knowledge of individual factors (like age or sex) and prevention or treatment strategies (sticking to one drink, hangover remedies) that we use to make sense of our hangovers. However, is there any evidence behind the anecdotes? Can we engage in any behaviour to cheat a hangover this festive season, or is our fate sealed in our individual make-up?</p> <p>Scientifically speaking, understanding what factors may contribute to a hangover may help us to determine the physiological and behavioural basis of the hangover and how best to prevent, or even cure it. Current evidence, like anecdotal accounts, focuses on individual factors and specific techniques that may influence our experience of hangover. Here I will focus on evidence for two of the most popular anecdotal factors: age and type of alcoholic beverage consumed.</p> <h2>Age</h2> <p>Many of us swear that our hangovers are more intense and longer-lasting the older we get. I for one am convinced that it takes me longer to recover from a big night out in my 30s than it did when I was a student in my 20s. Supporting evidence for the effects of age on the experience of hangover suggests we may be onto something.</p> <p><a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-2/95-106.pdf\">Studies of adult versus adolescent drinkers</a> show that hangover and alcohol withdrawal symptoms are reported less frequently in adolescents relative to adults. In addition, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1097/01.ALC.0000108655.51087.DF/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+7+December+from+10%3A00-15%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-10%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance\">a larger body of animal evidence</a> suggests that adolescent rats are less sensitive to the effects of hangover on anxiety and sociability. Adolescent rats were less anxious, and engaged in more social interactions during alcohol hangover compared with adult rodents.</p> <p>Even aside from the differences between rats and humans, these studies rely on comparisons made between adolescent and adult drinkers. This contrast does not necessarily reflect transitions in alcohol use that occur in an adult&rsquo;s life (eg going to university, becoming a parent, career changes).</p> <p>Interestingly, a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.12238/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+7+December+from+10%3A00-15%3A00+GMT+%2805%3A00-10%3A00+EST%29+for+essential+maintenance\">recent large-sample Danish study</a>&nbsp;examining younger and older adult drinkers found that the tendency to experience hangover following an episode of binge drinking decreased with age. The authors suggest that differences in hangover between younger and older adults may reflect differences in binge drinking patterns.</p> <p>The authors caution that whilst younger and older participants had similar average weekly consumption patterns, intensity of drinking was not assessed. It is therefore possible that older adults who binge may consume fewer drinks per binge than younger adults, resulting in fewer and less severe hangovers.</p> <h2>Type of alcoholic beverage</h2> <p>Another anecdotal factor in the experience of hangover is the notion that drinking a certain type of alcoholic beverage, or sticking to one type of drink, may prevent or lessen the effects of a night on the town. One reason for why we may experience hangovers of varying intensity after drinking different alcoholic beverages is the amount of congeners in a given drink.</p> <p>Congeners are biological compounds that can be made during the alcohol fermentation process or added during production. A small body of research has suggested that congeners may contribute to the feelings of intoxication we experience, and the subsequent likelihood of hangover.</p> <p>For example, alcoholic beverages with few congeners and higher pure ethanol content (such as gin and vodka) have been shown to induce fewer hangovers than drinks with higher levels of congeners like brandy or red wine <a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-1/54-60.pdf\">(here's a review). </a>&nbsp;However, this evidence on congeners was conducted in the 70s. Have we come any further in choosing an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; drink for reducing hangover?</p> <p>The study of congeners has slowed considerably since the 70s, but recently it has been revisited by scientists examining the effects of congeners on the neurocognitive effects of hangover. Studying 95 heavy drinkers in a placebo-controlled study of vodka versus bourbon, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01116.x/pdf\">this research from 2010 found</a> supporting evidence for the 70s studies.</p> <p>Participants reported greater hangover intensity after drinking bourbon (with high congener content) than vodka (low congener levels). But the two drinks did not differ in the effects they had on sleep, reaction time, motor performance, memory and attention the day after drinking. Therefore we may conclude that consumption of different beverages may influence our self-reported hangover the next day (how awful we feel), but will not necessarily affect our performance on everyday tasks such as driving, reading, or concentration in general.</p> <h2>The bottom line</h2> <p>The reality is that we as scientists know very little about the biological basis of alcohol hangover. In particular this area of research is lacking in large scale human studies. So what advice can I give to those who succumb to the dreaded Christmas hangover?</p> <p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7531/1515\">a systematic review</a> published in the British Medical Journal in 2005 does not bear good news. A review of eight randomised controlled trials revealed that there was no convincing evidence for any conventional or complementary interventions for the prevention or treatment of alcohol hangover.&nbsp;The article concludes by advising that the most effective way to avoid a hangover is to drink in moderation or to abstain from drinking alcohol.</p> <p>As far as second guessing a hangover is concerned, it appears the jury is out &hellip; sorry! However, the silver lining is that we alcohol scientists have lots more to learn about hangover, and I am more than happy to share what we find.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Dr Sally Adams is a lecturer in health psychology at the University of Bath.

        "headline":"'My iPad has Netflix, Spotify, Twitter – everything': why tablets are killing PCs",
        "body":"<p>Stephen Bernasconi walked into Trafford shopping centre on 25 November intending to buy a laptop for £800 or so. His three-year-old Dell Inspiron had broken down and he wanted something to keep up with gaming. Instead, the 23-year-old walked out of PC World with an iPad Air. \"I decided that this would be a more effective purchase as it allows me to do everything I require – Netflix, Spotify, Twitter, good games. It's light and can run loads of apps at once and doesn't slow down.\" He'd considered buying a Google Nexus 10 tablet, but having recently switched to an iPhone he decided to stick with Apple.</p><p>Emma Gilliam, meanwhile, hasn't replaced the Toshiba laptop she used at home since it died in June 2012; she also bought an iPad. A lecturer at  Cardiff University, she has a PC for work, but says \"I don't need more than a tablet for domestic or social use.\" She says a big benefit is that because the iPad doesn't run Microsoft programs: \"I keep work and home separate. I don't bring PC-crucial work home now, so I'm far more disciplined about finishing tasks rather than letting them spill over.\" She's using the iPad to learn Greek (\"using a Greek keyboard has been great\") and watch iPlayer.</p><p>She has discussed this with the  (unrelated) man opposite her on the train: \"His wife – probably around 50 – is also tablet-only. As is his mother.\"</p><p>It's people like Bernasconi and  Gilliam, and the man on the train's family, and millions like them, who are causing a tectonic shift in the world of computing – one which has seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/steve-ballmer\" title=\"\">Steve Ballmer</a> pushed out of his job as Microsoft's chief executive after 13 years, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/technology/acers-new-chairman-follows-a-familiar-tech-path.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">the chairman of Taiwanese PC maker Acer replaced</a>, and thousands of jobs, and pounds, lost at computer manufacturers.</p><p>The traditional PC business has a problem: it's in decline. The research company IDC reckons PC shipments will drop by 10.1% this year compared with 2012 – from 349.2m to 314m – and <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24466513\" title=\"\">continue to dwindle</a> from there, down to 305m by 2017, with no expectation of growth. Sales peaked in 2011, at 361.5m, and they're never coming back. And the examples of Bernasconi, Gilliam and many more show why: people have discovered that tablets  can do pretty much all the computing jobs they want done. They didn't  really need a PC in the first place; all the start menus, \"unused icons on your desktop\", \"New hardware detected\" and so on were just distractions from what they wanted to do – which might be answering (or just deleting) email, browsing websites, writing something, calling someone, or playing games. For tasks like that, a fully fledged Windows PC is overkill, as well as unwieldy and short on battery life. A tablet is neat, focused, and its battery lasts longer than a laptop.</p><p>Tablet sales are booming. In the three months up to and including Christmas, tablets will outsell PCs worldwide – and by 2016 they'll be seriously outselling them for the whole year.</p><p>The PC business, meanwhile, has turned into a replacement market. There are about 1.5bn PCs in use worldwide; the majority are used by businesses. For years, consumers have been buying about half the PCs sold; now they're turning to tablets, and only replacing their PC if they absolutely must. Businesses, too, are discovering that tablets have some advantages over PCs.</p><p>For instance, the 2012 Greek bailout – the biggest in history, requiring the renegotiation of €146bn of bonds among 135 principal bond owners in just 30 days – was completed using iPads. A specialised visualisation app (written by a British company, Bondholder Communications Group) ran on the encrypted, 3G-connected tablets that banks were happy to allow on their premises – something they'd never have agreed to for Windows  laptops, because of security fears about viruses. Because the iPads could be updated in real time, used while on the move, didn't constantly need charging and the progress could be shown  visually, the deal was done.</p><p>More prosaically, when a loss adjuster came to assess a water leak at my house recently, he documented the damage on a tablet, and took pictures with it as he went. All were included in the report which he compiled and sent off as he stood on our sodden carpet. Try doing that with a desktop or laptop computer.</p><p>This change has happened at  amazing speed. In January 2010,  when talk of an Apple tablet was just a well-sourced rumour, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/20/apple-tablet-reader-launch\" title=\"\">wrote</a> that nobody was quite sure what the new \"iPad/iSlate\" (the name wasn't yet known) would actually do for us, nor why we might like it.</p><p>Then, I noted: \"Everyone reckons that tablets just aren't that workable, because they are neither fish nor fowl in computing terms. Yet still they believe Apple can create the device that will be on everyone's menu. 'There's no really clear series of applications which define what a tablet is for,' says [analyst Ian] Fogg. 'It is more defined by its form factor – its shape and appearance – than its use.'\"</p><p>Then the iPad arrived – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/jan/28/apple-ipad-bashed-bloggers-web\" title=\"\">to sneers from many bloggers</a>. It's great fun to go back and re-read the opinions of those who hadn't tried it, but were sure it would be a flop: no physical keyboard, no slot for USB sticks or SD cards, couldn't show Flash video, no camera, no HDMI port for TV-out. (Apple did later add front and back cameras, and adaptors for SD cards.)</p><p>But none of those omissions  mattered, because it was what the iPad, and the tablets that followed it, brought which did count. They were mobile and really handy: you could pick one up and do a task (search for something, buy something with an app, send a tweet or email) in a moment and then put it down and get on with something else. Tablets brought us what you could call three-second computing. (At least one of the pundits who called the original iPad \"a dog … absolutely completely ridiculous\"  can now be seen touting his use of the latest iPad on his blog.)</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-425073901\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/16/131216techtabletsof2013-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2013/12/16/131216techtabletsof2013/131216techtabletsof2013.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/16//131216techtabletsof2013.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/16/131216techtabletsof2013_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/16/131216techtabletsof2013_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>And this huge shift has also created upheaval in the boardrooms of the businesses that the PC made rich. At Microsoft, where Bill Gates's mantra was \"a PC on every desk, running Microsoft software\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/23/microsoft-steve-ballmer-retire-sucessor-search\" title=\"\">Steve Ballmer is on the way out</a>, following pressure from other board members because his strategy to recreate the Windows desktop monopoly has been a failure in smartphones and tablets. Three years after its launch, Windows Phone has around 5% of world sales (by comparison, the iPhone had 16% of sales after the same period; Android, 35%), while Windows-based tablets have sold so poorly that in July <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/19/microsoft-900-million-charge-surface\" title=\"\">Microsoft took a bigger writeoff – $900m – on unsold models of its Surface</a> tablet than it collected in revenues from their sales.</p><p>This moment, where tablets outsell PCs, also marks another watershed: the end of the Windows monopoly on computing. It used to be that if you wanted to get something done, you would end up using Windows to do it. But as smartphone sales have exploded (they passed those of PCs three years ago), followed by tablets, the need to press the \"Start\" button has stopped. Ask yourself – what was the last consumer app whose popularity depended on being available for Windows? Quick research turns up the file backup service Dropbox, which arrived in September 2008, and the music service Spotify, which landed on desktops in October 2008 with no mobile equivalent.</p><p>At the same time Google launched the Android App Store, while Apple's App Store was already four months old. Smartphone sales began taking off – followed soon after by tablets. \"You'd have to have been insane to launch a desktop-only app after the launch of the App Store,\" says Alex Guest, a London-based media and technology entrepreneur.</p><p>Now, developers focused on the consumer market aim for a mobile app first: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> (founded October 2010, now at 150m users) and <a href=\"http://www.snapchat.com/\" title=\"\">Snapchat</a> (founded September 2011, estimated 30 million users every month) have never bothered with the desktop. If you only have a Windows PC, you can't do anything with either. For those who have grown up on PCs, such an attitude is puzzling; for the digital natives who use those apps it's natural.</p><p>For most people not working in specialist industries, the only everyday desktop essential is Office, Microsoft's other monopoly. But that is challenged too by Google's online Drive, which offer cheap online collaboration, and to a lesser extent by Apple's iWork apps – now free with the latest iPads – which also  run in any browser. But if people don't need or want PCs to do things, and buy fewer of them, that means Microsoft gets less and less revenue first from Windows, and than from Office.</p><p>For the incoming Microsoft chief executive, that means a landscape very different from the one Ballmer faced when he took over in January 2000. Rather than the slowly changing world Ballmer dealt with, the newcomer will face battles on multiple fronts – while facing a loss of revenue.</p><p>Horace Dediu, who runs his own Asymco consultancy, likes to describe how we buy technology as \"hiring [things] for a job to be done\". In the past, a PC's \"jobs\" have included education, bookkeeping, business workflows (where Office especially dominates), media creation and consumption, internet-based communication (text, audio or visual) and social media.</p><p>A PC doesn't do just one of those jobs – it can do them all. Yet paradoxically that makes it vulnerable to having particular jobs – such as email or educational uses, insurance reports or streaming Netflix – \"peeled away\", suggests Dediu.</p><p>\"The PC is a strange beast in that it seems to be a complicated, multi-dimensional product that was hired for different jobs throughout its life,\" he says. \"It seems to depend on new jobs to keep going and these jobs are peeled off by other devices over time. Once it runs out of new jobs it will inevitably decline. At least that's my hypothesis.\"</p><p>Looking at IBM data about how people shopped online this year is revealing, he says. There has been a 40% drop in the use of PCs for online shopping over the past two years.</p><p>That, he says, could suggest that PCs just won't be used for that kind of transaction in eight or nine years. \"What's worse is that it looks like PCs will never reach saturation. The penetration of US households, for example, peaked well below 80%. Also, the replacement of PCs will be swifter than the rate of their penetration.\"</p><p>We think that our love affair with PCs was intense but, says Dediu, PC adoption rates lagged behind other technologies including radio, colour TV, microwave, VCR, HDTV, DVD, mobile phone, smartphone and tablets.</p><p>For PC companies, making PCs has never been a particularly profitable business; even five years ago, on average they made a profit of around $25 (£15) per PC, on machines that they sold for an average $640 (£390). Wholesaler and retail markups pushed the price higher to the end user. That's about a 4% margin. By September this year, that had dropped to just $14.90, on machines that on average cost $545. That's a 2.7% margin – vulnerable to rises in component pricing as volumes fall. If making PCs isn't profitable, why do it at all?</p><p>In short, it's the end of an era. It's not that we will abruptly stop using PCs – specific applications such as professional video editing or machinery control, and uses of Office inside big organisations, won't change for ages. But the PC's position as the only place to do tasks we thought of as \"computing\" is in danger of vanishing for ever.</p><h2>Why Microsoft has a huge headache<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425313082'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/Gallery_Images/2011/4/28/1304029212124/Ceo-of-Microsoft-Steve-Ba-005.jpg' alt='Ceo of Microsoft Steve Ballmer' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer … forced out. Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/ Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>Steve Ballmer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/23/microsoft-steve-ballmer-retire-sucessor-search\" title=\"\">announced in August</a> that was to step down as its chief executive. A successor is expected to be unveiled early in 2014 but Ballmer has already set in train a corporate reorganisation, as well as a focus on selling \"devices and services\". So the new boss will come into a company struggling with both exterior and interior change.</p><p>By going for \"devices and services\" Microsoft is making itself a bit more like both Apple and Google. The problem, as <a href=\"http://www.tech-thoughts.net/2013/12/executing-devices-services-strategy.html\" title=\"\">described by technology analyst Sameer Singh</a>, is: what does it want to make money from? Apple makes its money from the devices, and uses services (such as iTunes and Maps and iCloud) to keep users tied to its platform. Google gives its services away to run on all sorts of devices, and makes money from users through showing them adverts.</p><p>So which way does Microsoft want to go? If it prices its devices to make money, it will be undercut. It has a better chance with its services (Office and Windows are facts of life for many corporations) but rivals such as Amazon and Google are chasing its nascent \"cloud\" business. \"Devices and services\" might have to mutate into \"devices OR services\". It's another headache for the new arrival next year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425303722|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|6a13b8e9125ce3fd242079946eaecb84671f1e56 -->",

Relatives of Rigby cried as the verdicts were given.</p><p>Rigby's stepfather, Ian, wiped away tears and put his arm around the soldier's mother, Lyn, who was sobbing.</p><p>Mr Justice Sweeney, who ordered that the decisions be heard in silence, said he would pass sentence after a key appeal court ruling on the use of whole life terms in January.</p><p>Adebolajo looked at the press and kissed his Qur'an as he was taken to the court cells.</p><p>Adebolajo, from Romford, Essex, and Adebowale, from Greenwich, south London, claimed they were soldiers of Allah and their violence was a reprisal against western foreign policy, which had led to the deaths of Muslims.</p><p>At the time of the attack, Rigby was attached to the regimental recruiting team and was on his way back to barracks in Woolwich from a shift working at the Tower of London. Previously he had served a tour of duty in Helmand, Afghanistan, fighting Islamist militants.</p><p>His wife, Rebecca Rigby, said: \"I would like to thank everyone who has helped us to finally get justice for Lee.</p><p>\"This has been the toughest time of our lives and no one should have to go through what we have been through as a family. These people have taken away my baby's dad, but Lee's memory lives on through our son and we will never forget him.</p><p>\"I now want to build a future for Jack and make him proud of his dad like we all are.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425391516'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387458150119/The-public-statement-guil-006.jpg' alt='The public statement guilty verdict being read after the Lee Rigby murder trail' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rigby's family read a public statement after the guilty verdicts. Photograph: Sky News</figcaption></figure><p>Rigby's mother said: \"We would like to thank everyone for their overwhelming support. We are satisfied that justice has been served; but unfortunately no amount of justice will ever bring Lee back. We now ask that we are left along to grieve for our loss.\"</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, the head of the Met's specialist operations, welcomed the verdicts: \"We are pleased that justice has been done. At this very difficult time, our thoughts are with Lee's family and all those who knew and loved him. This horrific attack, which took place in broad daylight on the streets of London, shocked the country and was intended to divide communities. It had largely the opposite effect and has, in fact, brought people together.</p><p>\"The court heard of extraordinary acts of courage and compassion from members of the public at the time of this terrifying and dreadful incident.\"</p><p>The brother of one the killers said the attack was inevitable and the justification for Rigby's death was obvious. Speaking to al-Jazeera's Investigations Unit, Jeremiah Adebolajo, who like his brother Michael is a Muslim convert, predicted another Woolwich-style attack due to British foreign policy.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425391519'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369313591037/This-suspect-in-the-killi-010.jpg' alt='This suspect in the killing of a soldier in Woolwich has been identified as Michael Adebolajo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Adebolajo videoed after the killing of Lee Rigby.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, the 26-year-old, who was banned from attending the Old Bailey for some of his brother's trial for security reasons, said: \"I suggest that it won't be the last [attack], simply because of the tactics of the British secret service and foreign policy. For every violent action is a violent reaction.\"</p><p>After Rigby was attacked in the street, Adebolajo was filmed on the mobile phones of passersby, justifying the murder as a strike against the west, in language echoing the propaganda of violent jihad.</p><p>In the footage, Adebolajo said: \"You people will never be safe.\"</p><p>Brandishing a cleaver and a knife in his bloodied hands, and with the body of Rigby lying metres away, Adebolajo said: \"We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you. The only reason we have done this is because Muslims are dying every day. This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425391520'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/30/1369868584148/Michael-Adebowale-010.jpg' alt='Michael Adebowale' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Adebowale at the scene of the killing of  Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich.

Remove your government, they don't care about you.</p><p>\"You think David Cameron is going to get caught in the street when we start bussin' our guns? You think politicians are going to die? No it's going to be the average guy, like you, and your children. So get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops back so you can all live in peace.\"</p><p>The pair hung around for several minutes before armed police arrived at the scene. The two men then rushed the officers, who shot the pair. They claimed they wanted to be shot dead so they would be martyrs.</p><p>Adebolajo decided before one court hearing that he wished to be called after one of the most notorious Islamist extremists in British history. He asked to be addressed as Mujaahid Abu Hamza. His co-accused asked to be addressed as Ismail Ibn Abdullah during proceedings.</p><p>The murder raised questions for the security services, who had had both men on their radar.</p><p>They had been known to MI5 and the police for eight years but had been assessed as peripheral figures and thus not subjected to a full-scale investigation.</p><p>Adebolajo, who was born into a church-going Nigerian family but converted to Islam, had complained of harassment by MI5 in the last three years after he came to the intelligence agency's attention.</p><p>He was detained by Kenyans for suspected extremist activity in 2010 and later deported to Britain, the Foreign Office confirmed.</p><p>Adebowale was also a convert to Islam. As a teenager, he witnessed a murder and was himself stabbed in a frenzied knife attack five years ago. He suffered from psychotic episodes caused by cannabis abuse and by the psychological effects of being caught up in the fatal stabbing incident in January 2008, when he was 16.</p><p>Both attackers had attended events of the extremist group al-Muhajiroun and, after it was banned, of its successor groups.</p><p></p><p>Adebolajo and Adebowale face sentences of life imprisonment, with the main issue for the judge being how long a minimum tariff they should serve before they can even be considered for release.</p><p>Adebolajo showed no remorse for his actions when he gave evidence in his trial, telling jurors that he was a \"soldier of Allah\" and that he had no choice but to obey the command of Allah.</p><p>Speaking in a low voice only feet from Rigby's family, Adebolajo described how he held the soldier's hair as he hacked at his neck in a motion described by one witness as like a \"butcher attacking a joint of meat\".</p><p>Another horrified bystander said he \"instantly believed that he was trying to cut the victim's head off\" when he saw the man using a meat cleaver to mutilate Rigby's motionless body. A third witness said Adebolajo had a look of pure evil after attacking Rigby's head while his accomplice rammed knives into his chest like he was \"trying to remove his organs from his torso\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425364802|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|3a819c3b68ecbb297770a1a22e92dbd20090f4d0 -->",

        "headline":"The best TV of 2013: No 1 – The Returned (Channel 4)",
        "body":"<p>A French alpine town that exists both in concrete and in the imagination. A&nbsp;town connected to the rest of the world, yet wholly isolated. A&nbsp;town both in and out of time. A&nbsp;town where all the roads out seem inevitably to lead back; cars and buses drive for hours on a perpetual loop. The only person who seems to find this particularly surprising – or indeed, troubling – is the viewer.</p><p>The subtitled French drama The Returned was quite the classiest programme of the year. While unashamedly acknowledging its thriller and horror roots – Twin Peaks and The Omen to name just two – it brilliantly subverted the conventional zombie tropes to create a TV programme quite unlike anything that had been previously made.</p><p>At its heart was the existential question that is as profound as it is infrequently asked. What if the worst you could imagine wasn't having a child die in a car crash or having your fiance kill himself on your wedding day, but them coming back to life? Almost as they were before, but not quite.</p><p>The series opened with the reappearance of Camille, who had been killed in a coach crash four years earlier. She returned not as the conventional hollow-eyed zombie hell-bent on revenge on the living but as a recognisable, sentient being, albeit one who had been frozen in time and now looked four years younger than Lena, her twin sister. A teenaged girl who wanted to be loved and was just as troubled about what was happening to her as her sister and parents. Was she a gift from God, a punishment from the devil or was this just a different natural order?</p><p>Victor was the creepy boy who had watched his mother being murdered many years previously before being killed himself. He had many of the supernatural hallmarks of Damien in The Omen, but with an added childish innocence. His psychopathic tendencies were offset by the vulnerability of a young boy who just wants to be loved and looked after. One of Victor's murderers, Pierre, had now installed himself as a charismatic preacher in the town. Was he good or bad? It was never clear if even he himself knew.</p><p>Most drama series start off complicated and slowly offer up their secrets. The Returned started complex and became ever more so: as one storyline hinted at a resolution, another came along to further muddy the waters. The rules of engagement could only be hazily guessed at. While the dead could be killed and rekilled – Simon, Adele's ex-fiance, repeatedly self-resurrected – the possibility also began to emerge that it might not just be the dead who were dead. Perhaps the living were a different strain of the dead?</p><p>Then there was the psychopathic and dead Serge who had a predilection for killing and eating young women in the town's only underpass – a place best avoided – and his brother Toni. The dam that unaccountably started leaking to reveal a village that had been flooded decades before. The dead sheep and the hordes of the dead, or undead, that gathered in the woods.</p><p>Nothing much made sense, yet The Returned's atmospheric grip – not to mention fine performances from the central characters and a compelling soundtrack from Mogwai – was powerful enough to carry the audience through. It wasn't perfect, but then what is? As the series reached its end, a slight sense of cynicism did creep in. Were the producers deliberately blurring the script and fudging the revelations to set up the commercially important second series?</p><p>If they had held their nerve, resisted the siren call of cash and answered some of the questions – such as why Simon did kill himself on his wedding day – that really did need a first-series resolution, The Returned could have become an instant TV&nbsp;classic. As it is, it will just have to settle for being streets ahead of almost all its competition. Plus, there is always the upside that we will get another series to ease the longueurs of the 2014 summer schedules. But it's going to have to work hard to match the first.</p><p><em>• See the full countdown of the Best of TV of 2013 at </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio\" title=\"\"><em>theguardian.com/tv</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425322340|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|0dc460e3e1c5de51b4c26f51874bf02ab78d9e37 -->",

        "body":"<p>The first time hundreds of millions of people heard about <a href=\"http://bitstrips.com/\">Bitstrips</a> was when its customised comic strips started appearing in their Facebook news feeds in October, en masse.</p> <p>Bitstrips has since gone on to become the second most-downloaded iOS app in the world in November, with the Canadian company <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/12/bitstrips-series-a-3-million/\">raising $3m of funding</a> just as its app topped app store charts around the world. But who is Bitstrips, why did it become so popular so quickly, and what will it do next?</p> <p>A chat with chief executive and creative director Jacob Blackstock (known as &quot;BA&quot; to friends and colleagues) provides some answers hinting that Bitstrips may be more than just the latest short-lived app craze. Starting with the fact that there's a longer backstory than you might think.</p> <p>&quot;I've been drawing since I was a little kid. I started taking animation classes when I was six years old, using stop-motion animation and Super-8 film,&quot; says Blackstock.&nbsp;&quot;My mom has boxes and boxes of my old sketchbooks and comics! I would either draw comics in class instead of paying attention, or draw comics for my school projects. So I'd either get in trouble for doing them or get good grades depending on the situation, but comics have been a lifelong passion.&quot;</p> <p>Blackstock was also a voracious comics reader and cartoons viewer from an early age, falling in with a group of close friends who shared these interests, and would gather after school to read comics, but also draw their own, selling some of them at the local comics store.</p> <p>&quot;As we got older, in high school we'd really use comics as a way to interact. We'd put each other into comics to make each other laugh, to embarrass each other, or to get each other into trouble,&quot; he says, adding that even when Blackstock and his co-founders had jobs, they'd still fax &quot;embarrassing pictures&quot; of one another as pranks.</p> <p>&quot;We were always engaged in what you could call the analogue version of Bitstrips,&quot; he says. Blackstock spent 18 months developing an animated TV series which wasn't made, then spent three years making it himself, frame-by-frame, funding it by running animation workshops for children. Next, he set up a creative studio with those friends, with the idea for Bitstrips born in 2007, and launching as a standalone website in 2008.</p> <p>The idea was pretty much the same as the mobile app that's been so popular in 2013: people created an avatar of themselves, then customised various comic-strip &quot;scenes&quot; created by Bitstrips to create their own pithy stories, regardless of drawing skills or digital abilities.</p> <p>“We kind of saw it as YouTube for comics. The technology had gotten to a point where we could share the fun that we’d been having with the rest of the world, and that might actually create some really amazing results,” says Blackstock.&nbsp;“We basically gave people a character-builder tool and a comic-builder tool, and let them go nuts. Which they did! We saw all these creative uses for it: people doing things with the tools that we’d made that we’d never even thought would be possible.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-62dc250a-e9f4-4ed7-a0f8-e6b1ecab0e91\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387444581215/4e221c72-c511-45e2-be40-a7ccd422e9c0-460x166.jpeg\" alt=\"Bitstrips explained its growth to users with, yes, a comic strip.\" width=\"460\" height=\"166\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Bitstrips explained its growth to users with, yes, a comic strip.</figcaption> </figure> <p>That included teachers in North America starting to use Bitstrips in the classroom, leading the company to launch a version called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bitstripsforschools.com/ontario/\">Bitstrips for Schools</a>. That's the second surprising thing about Bitstrips: its roots are as much in education as in entertainment, with its software licensed to all publicly-funded schools in its home state of Ontario thanks to a partnership with its&nbsp;Ministry of Education.</p> <p>“Kids were getting really engaged with their schoolwork. It was a combination of the fact that they’re using this medium that they love –&nbsp;comics –&nbsp;which is really visual, appealing and expressive, and also the fact that they had the avatars in their work. They weren’t just communicating through comics, they were communicating through their own avatars,” says Blackstock.</p> <p>“It’s thrilling, the idea that this gets kids excited about writing and reading. And we’ve heard incredible stories about kids who were having difficulties with the standard mode of writing text on blank paper, who then became prolific comic authors.&nbsp;We’ve also heard about autistic kids who were barely able to communicate, who were able to find a voice through Bitstrips. It’s been a really rewarding aspect of the tools we created.”</p> <p>Bitstrips for Schools was also rewarding enough financially to fund the company as it worked on a new version of the main website, retooling it as <a href=\"https://apps.facebook.com/bitstrips/\">a Facebook application which launched in 2012</a>. By then, though, Blackstock and his colleagues had already realised that the service needed to go mobile.</p> <p>“As soon as we launched the Facebook app, we were working on the mobile app, which we spent another year developing, and finally finished at the end of this summer,” says Blackstock. “We launched on Android at the end of August, then on iOS on 1 October. And two weeks after the iOS launch, it reached this tipping point and went mega viral.”</p> <p>The proof of that was in hundreds of millions of people's Facebook news feeds in October and November. Until the mobile apps launched, people had created 10m avatars using Bitstrips' website and Facebook app – this is a rough measure of registered users, specifically those who'd signed up&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;created their character – but in the two months after its iOS and Android launch, another 30m were created.</p> <p>Bitstrips isn't giving out more detailed statistics for now – for example on how many of those 30m new users are still active – but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2013/12/13/facebook-app-bitstrips-more-than-30m-avatars-and-counting/\">this chart published by Inside Facebook</a>&nbsp;based on analytics from industry database AppData, shows the jump in monthly active users:</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e65e688f-8e61-46e6-9088-e6b32cb4e642\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387439992948/4b57ada2-7197-4dfb-891c-ae517a51988b-460x241.png\" alt=\"Bitstrips' monthly active users, according to AppData.\" width=\"460\" height=\"241\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Bitstrips' monthly active users, according to AppData.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The huge spike came as a surprise to Bitstrips: “We were in testing mode. We thought of it as a stealth launch where we could find the bugs and put in more features, before officially launching it,” says Blackstock. “We never told anyone about it, never spent a penny on marketing, yet all of a sudden it was just exploding everywhere.”</p> <p>Mobile analytics company App Annie claims that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/18/android-ios-app-revenues-research\">Bitstrips was the second most-downloaded app globally</a> on Apple’s App Store in November, behind only MomentCam –&nbsp;a different personalised-comics app –&nbsp;but ahead of YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp and other big apps.</p> <p>“It feels like one of those ‘overnight successes’ that was actually the product of seven years of toil,” says Blackstock, who notes that the viral effect –&nbsp;the average Bitstrip user has 50 friends who’ve created an avatar using the app –&nbsp;has been a big factor in the recent spike. “We see this as the app that turns your circle of friends into your own personal Springfield,’ he says, referencing The Simpsons.</p> <p>What next? Continuing to feed this community, avoiding the Draw Something trajectory of burning brightly on the app store then fading away, and actually making money from the app.&nbsp;On the former count, Bitstrips launches four new comic strips a day, as well as a recent batch of more than 150 Christmas-themed strips for users to customise and share. More than 2,000 scenes are already available in the app, with plans to continue this approach.</p> <p>“We’re able to do things that are really timely: when there are current events, we can have a comic about that within 24 hours. It’s a way for our users to participate in news, media and memes,” says Blackstock. “When the royal baby was born, we had a comic out that day in which you were the baby, and Prince William was holding you up Lion King style.”</p> <p>This may sound like novelty territory, but the ability to respond to topical events –&nbsp;or more accurately, to give people the tools to respond to them –&nbsp;is one of Bitstrips’ most interesting features, and part of a wider trend for tools (often apps) that remove the need to have, say, Photoshop skills to create and share visual content.</p> <p>“It’s not just about jokes: it’s a really powerful way to communicate,” says Blackstock. “People are using this as a political platform for example. Whatever your message is, a picture is worth a thousand words.” Bitstrips is already fielding calls from some celebrities too, wondering how they can work with the company.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c983a122-1b0e-4cea-8535-fe300e4e82aa\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387445017338/20fbdc90-a5ac-4ac5-8fcb-aed7e71bacb2-460x319.jpeg\" alt=\"Bitstrips' iOS app was the second most-downloaded in the world in November.\" width=\"460\" height=\"319\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Bitstrips' iOS app was the second most-downloaded in the world in November.</figcaption> </figure> <p>What about the second challenge: avoiding becoming another flash-in-the-pan app? Especially if Bitstrips becomes known as “that annoying comics app” by people who don’t really like the strips, and specifically don’t like dozens of them clogging up their Facebook feeds?</p> <p>Bitstrips can't stop your friends and family over-sharing, but it does seem aware of the risks.&nbsp;It has already tweaked the app so users aren’t forced to share their comics to Facebook every time, for example: they can now choose to share them within Bitstrips alone, or via other means like Twitter and email.</p> <p>“We’re working on more stuff that’s really going to improve the experience of reading these comics within the app, receiving and even interacting with your friends’ content,” says Blackstock. He doesn’t talk about other forthcoming features, but I wonder if animation –&nbsp;moving Bitstrips –&nbsp;are on the company’s roadmap too: cartoons in the TV sense of the word, as well as the comic-strip sense.</p> <p>The third challenge is how Bitstrips makes money, given that it doesn’t currently charge for the app or its scenes, nor does it carry advertising. In-app purchases are one likely avenue –&nbsp;premium scenes perhaps, in the same way that messaging apps like Line offer a mixture of free and paid stickers for people to send to friends.</p> <p>Premium scenes might also be a way for Bitstrips to partner with celebrities, film studios and other popular brands –&nbsp;although it might also be able to charge brands to sponsor free scenes in the same way that websites like BuzzFeed sell “native advertising” that look like normal articles on the site.</p> <p>“We’ve thought about those things, and we do have pretty detailed ideas. But we are really focused on growth and improving the experience right now,” says Blackstock, mirroring the words of other rapidly-growing-app entrepreneurs before him (see: Instagram, Snapchat, etc).&nbsp;“We still have a lot of work to do on the app to get it to where we want it to be before we start to look at those things. We don’t like apps that do things that detract from the experience, so we’ll make sure whatever we do is really true to the brand, and adds value.”</p> <p>There are plenty of dangers for Bitstrips in the months ahead. Although it's broadening the ways people can share their comics with friends beyond Facebook, its reliance on the social network for viral growth so far puts it at risk if that virality is suddenly checked by a change in the news feed algorithm, as happened to video-sharing app Viddy last year.</p> <p>&quot;Starting soon, we’ll be doing a better job of distinguishing between a high quality article on a website versus a meme photo hosted somewhere other than Facebook when people click on those stories on mobile,” <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/Content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=768&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;ClientID=1\">announced Facebook in a blog post</a> on 2 December. “This means that high quality articles you or others read may show up a bit more prominently in your News Feed, and meme photos may show up a bit less prominently.”</p> <p>Bitstrips will have to negotiate the ups and downs of news feed changes, but Blackstock says his company wants to prove that personalised, socially-shared comic strips are much more than a viral annoyance. In fact, he's got big ambitions for comics as tools of self-expression.</p> <p>“If you think about comics as a communication tool –&nbsp;this medium for self-expression –&nbsp;that’s a no-brainer for people making comics on their own already, but when you think about it as something that could be accessible to everyone, it’s potentially revolutionary. It’s like giving people typewriters for the first time,” he says.</p> <p>“Comics are this visual language that combines images, symbols, composition… When you have characters conveying things about emotion, it’s more like the way humans naturally communicate face-to-face, with facial expressions, body language, hand gestures.&nbsp;It’s a really powerful medium of expression, especially when you combine this aspect of identity into it –&nbsp;you and your friends –&nbsp;it goes beyond just being a medium for expression and becomes a really powerful social mechanism as well.”</p> <p><em><strong>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/15/50-best-apps-2013-iphone-android-observer\">The 50 best apps of 2013</a></strong></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425358211|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|9172715871c288bde0043491fd1c418763812b5c -->",

        "body":"<p>On Tuesday I woke up to find myself on page 3 of the Daily Mail. That may be one of the worst ways to start the day, after falling out of bed or realising you've run out of milk. My appearance was not the result of taking my clothes off, but the consequence of a \"Twitter storm\".</p><p>While on holiday in Berlin last weekend I spotted a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/17/david-cameron-oil-painting-catherine-the-great\" title=\"\">painting of Catherine the Great which looked remarkably like David Cameron</a>. I tweeted the picture and within hours it had been retweeted thousands of times. This experience has certainly taught me a few things about viral social media.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>This painting of an 18th century woman totally looks like David Cameron in drag <a href=\"http://t.co/IZNOUqFSll\">pic.twitter.com/IZNOUqFSll</a></p><p>&mdash; Sophie Gadd (@sophie_gadd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophie_gadd/statuses/412236333051305984\">December 15, 2013</a></p></blockquote><h2>1. The internet is very cynical</h2><p>Within minutes of the photograph appearing on Twitter, the mobs appeared claiming Photoshop. I was slightly perturbed at the accusation that I might spend my holidays editing photographs of the prime minister. One person even bizarrely suggested that there was nothing to laugh at because it was actually a painting of Cameron.</p><h2>2. Anyone can and will copy you</h2><p>After a few hours I started to find my picture cropping up with the same caption, but no credit to me as the source. It seems ridiculous to get annoyed about something which only exists digitally, but it feels quite violating. These people who shamelessly reproduce jokes on social media will probably be getting coal for Christmas.</p><h2>3. Your throwaway observation can make the news</h2><p>Social media doesn't just share the news any more, it makes the news. It is incredibly surreal for an ordinary person to find themselves in the press for not really doing much at all. Hearing your name on the radio is like listening to someone speaking a different language and suddenly recognising an English word.</p><h2>4. Nothing is private</h2><p>When you only have a small number of followers, Twitter can feel like an intimate group of pub friends. But it's not. It's no more private than shouting your conversations through a megaphone in the high street. Before this week I'd been quite open with my tweets, reasoning that since I didn't have that many followers no one would see. When I found the picture in the Mail I made an offhand sarcastic comment to a Twitter follower which then appeared in the Telegraph as part of a paragraph about how I was concerned about potential backlash. This has definitely made me more cautious of using social media.</p><h2>5. Accidentally going viral is both brilliant and awful</h2><p>At first it's exciting seeing your thought going around the world. But then after the 100th message saying the same thing even your own joke can start to get a bit boring. It's certainly been an interesting experience, but perhaps not one I'd want to happen on a weekly basis. I think my phone would explode if it did.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425327206|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|02894e5601c0f3948f75d2ab9af56eb824154fca -->",

        "body":"<p>Heather Mills could be subject to disciplinary action after the International Paralympic Committee alleged she \"verbally abused\" and \"physically harassed\" an official.</p><p>Mills, the former wife of the Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, had said on Monday that she was abandoning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2013/aug/23/heather-mills-skiing-bring-paralympic-glory\" title=\"\">her hopes of skiing at the 2014 Sochi Paralympics</a> after the IPC ruled a new prosthetic leg she was competing on had not been ratified.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/25441200\" title=\"\">According to the BBC</a>, the IPC said that on hearing the news Mills went into a \"wild tantrum\". The IPC skiing committee head, Sylvana Mestre, claimed: \"I was trying to explain to [Mills] that this is not the equipment we approved earlier in the year and then that was it, she exploded. She jumped on me. She grabbed me from the back and she started to say that 'you don't know who I am, I will make your life miserable'.\"</p><p>In defence of Mills, 45, her coach John Clark said he planned to make a formal complaint about the behaviour of Mestre, claiming there was a \"vendetta\" against Mills and that Mestre had \"deliberately put barriers in the way\" to halt her progress.</p><p>A representative of the former model Mills said in a statement: \"Heather waited patiently to try and explain to Sylvana Mestre that her left boot was legal and purely cosmetic to abide by the archaic IPC rules. Sylvana shouted at Heather, would not let Tony [the GB coach] speak or explain, and stormed back to the boardroom raised table.\"</p><p>However, Craig Spence, head of media at the IPC, said: \"It was harassment. It was absolutely disgraceful behaviour.\" He added: \"It is likely we will sanction the athlete and this will incur a fine of between €500-€1,000.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01np7vk\" title=\"\">Spence later told Radio 5</a> on Thursday morning that Mills had turned up uninvited for a coaches' meeting on Monday evening after having been told to stay away. He said their position was that she should submit fresh paper work on the prosthetic leg to the IPC and they would consider its eligibility.</p><p>\"Sylvana then went to explain this to Heather Mills and she never got as far as explaining it – Heather went into a rage that was witnessed by 10 coaches from other countries, who were shocked at what happened,\" he claimed. \"Heather verbally abused our official, she pushed her and had to be restrained by the two British coaches on site. We absolutely do not condone that.\"</p><p>Asked if there was any way back for Mills, Spence said: \"That's for her to decide. We have rules in place, we are likely to sanction her for her tantrum and if she submits an equipment form and her new prosthetics supplier takes liability for that in competition, then there's a chance we will sign that off, but the ball is very much in Heather Mills' court right now.\"</p><p>Mills lost the lower half of her left leg after a collision with a police motorbike in 1993. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/16/heather-mills-2014-winter-paralympics-ski-team\" title=\"\">She was in the frame for the 2014 Winter Paralympics</a> after winning silver in the World Cup in New Zealand last August.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425364628|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|4e21d7a17815b642ba6d4ad9462fa18665286551 -->",

        "trailText":"Robbie Rogers says reaction to his coming out has been opposite of what he expected and he now helps others to overcome prejudice",
        "headline":"Robbie Rogers ends insane year with activism and support replacing fear",
        "body":"<p>Robbie Rogers is sitting in a first-floor suite at the Soho Hotel in London, the bar downstairs buzzing with Christmas parties in full swing, mulling over how best to describe his year. At one stage he had feared it might be terrifying. It was always going to be ground-breaking though, in the end, he might have plumped for revelatory if the word did not sound quite so self-important. \"Insane,\" he says. \"The whole year's been absolutely insane. Nothing I'd expected has happened. Most of what I feared hasn't happened, either. It's been quite the opposite, with nothing but support and love from friends, team-mates, family.\"</p><p>It is safe to assume Rogers is in a better place now. It was actually last November when the USA forward, then contracted to Leeds United but on loan at Stevenage Borough, came out to his family. He had retired from the game by the time he chose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/15/robbie-rogers-comes-out-gay-soccer\" title=\"\">to tell the world in February</a>, via a post on his own website, which liberated him from 25 years of \"hiding such a big secret\". When he first spoke with the Guardian in March<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/29/robbie-rogers-coming-out-gay\" title=\"\">, he admitted he had felt compelled to leave professional football </a>before making an announcement he could not have delivered while still playing for Leeds, Columbus Crew, or \"any club – anywhere\". He doubted he could ever venture back into the game, and had no appetite for \"the circus\" that would surround him if he did. His future, he suspected, would be in the world of fashion.</p><p>Things have not quite worked out as he envisaged. Rogers returns to Elland Road on Saturday as a guest of the Yorkshire club but also as a player with Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer and an ambassador for <a href=\"http://www.beyondit.org\" title=\"\">Beyond \"it\"</a>, an anti-discrimination initiative seeking to raise money and awareness for nonprofit organisations fighting labels and stereotypes in society. A 26-year-old who had initially been uncomfortable as a role model has turned activist in recent months. If there was a sense of regret that Rogers had felt the need to leave the game before making his announcement, his status as the only openly gay male athlete in a prominent North American professional sport has made waves.</p><p>The route back began when he spoke to 500 gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender teenagers in Portland, Oregon, in April, an event which left the emigre from the game feeling \"like a coward\". \"In the end they were encouraging me more than me helping them,\" he recalls. \"That's really why I went back. I'm still happy I did it the way I did. I got to step away from it a little bit, on my own terms, but I did miss the game and saw an opportunity not just to talk the talk but to play football and make a statement. People ask me whether other footballers are going to come out, and since I'm on the other side it's easy for me to say: 'Yeah, of course,' and have that confidence to say everyone will support them.</p><p>\"I almost have to remind myself how hard things were, how miserable and sad I was before. Just because I've had such a great year, full of positivity … so I did feel a responsibility. This week I spent time with the Belgian football federation and speaking with GQ magazine in Germany, and they were looking for a footballer to answer questions on this matter. They didn't have anyone else they could turn to because I'm the only footballer so far who's come out. Last year I was hoping that, by this time, there would be other athletes who would feel comfortable to come out.</p><p>\"Even when Jason Collins came out in the NBA [in April] I thought it might start a bit of a movement. But it didn't. I've not had a single message, phone call or email from another gay footballer since I was out. It just goes to show how deep the problem is. If there's that much fear and the atmosphere is not so supportive…\"</p><p>He has since seen Tom Daley, the British Olympic diver, take to YouTube to reveal he is in a relationship with a man, making the announcement to \"put an end to all the rumours and speculation\". \"I don't know if I've helped people like Tom, but I do know I've helped other kids,\" says Rogers. \"I've worked with kids in California, kids who have been suicidal. A lot of these people feel they're so alone, but they can connect with my story. When I was growing up I didn't have anyone who was gay to look up to. Maybe these guys can follow in my footsteps. That was never my plan. Not at all. Obviously, I had no plan to go back to football or be a spokesperson of any kind. But, on the other hand, I'm happy people can see there's been a happy ending to my story and that they can connect with it.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-406263027\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/3/26/130326RobbieRogersEDIT-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/3/26/130326RobbieRogersEDIT-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/3/26/130326RobbieRogersEDIT_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130326RobbieRogersEDIT/130326RobbieRogersEDIT.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/3/26/130326RobbieRogersEDIT_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/3/26/130326RobbieRogersEDIT_vpx.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>Returning to professional football only felt possible with Galaxy. Rogers has a special affinity with London – \"the city where I really found myself, where I discovered who I really am\" – but had craved Los Angeles, where his parents live in nearby Huntington Beach. He had trained with the club as a teenager, undertaken rehabilitation there after breaking his ankle at Leeds, and knew the manager, Bruce Arena, who had watched the winger emerge through the US junior representative ranks while he oversaw the senior set-up. In May, after a period training with Galaxy, Chicago Fire transferred his MLS rights in exchange for the LA striker Mike Magee and, on 26 May, Rogers came off the bench in a 4-0 victory over Seattle Sounders and returned to the professional game.</p><p>\"At first it was scary,\" he says. \"I was scared just to go back to train. My experience of locker rooms in the past … things I'd previously heard had scarred me. That made me nervous. But they've been very supportive. The guys are definitely more sensitive when I'm in the locker room. In that environment, people aren't really aware what they're saying all the time. They might describe a couch, for example, as being 'gay' so sometimes you'll hear comments. They're not being homophobic, and they won't even be talking to me. It'll just be a stream of consciousness.</p><p>\"I'm not sensitive to that stuff any more. It's more stuff that I heard in the past at other clubs that affected me: like conversations about how someone could even be gay. How could someone be in love with another man? That affected me more. I'm not dumb. I realise when something is malicious.\"</p><p>It was an indication of the acceptance within the dressing room that, in a Miami restaurant last August, Rogers found himself comfortable enough to answer some of his team-mates' questions. \"There were about six of us, an eclectic group with some guys who'd played in World Cups and others in their early 20s, and I could talk through my experiences, whether going to a gay bar or going on my first date. Stuff like that. The guys who are a bit clever catch on and realise: 'Shit, Robbie's first date was when he was 25, his first relationship. That's really messed up, but really interesting.' Then they ask questions. It's important to have that kind of education in a locker room.</p><p>\"With opponents, the MLS is a small world. I've probably played with a lot of the guys on every team, whether for clubs or the national side, but I get people coming up and wishing me luck. I still find it strange when they say: 'Congratulations for coming out and being gay.' Sometimes I'll even get a 'thank you' after a game and I'm there thinking: 'I wonder if he's saying thank you because he's gay, or if he's saying thank you on behalf of other people in his life.' That's happened a few times, which is kind of interesting.</p><p>\"For the most part the supporters have been great, too. When we played at Portland Timbers they had a big banner for me [reading \"Timbers Army in Solidarity with Robbie Rogers\" and draped over a hoarding at JELD-WEN Field]. Sometimes I'll be in stadiums and hear 'a comment' from one person, who'll then hide. That's inevitable. It's going to happen in every country. But 95% of it is positive. So positive I sit there and wonder why no one else is doing this … It would be nice if they did.\"</p><p>Yet he accepts the reaction in the US would contrast markedly with that had he returned as a player to this country. He recounts a story where he and another Leeds substitute, the Finland international Mikael Forssell, were warming up on the touchline as visiting players when a Finnish national supporting the home team started abusing the striker. \"Mika is like the David Beckham of Finland, but he was calling him everything under the sun, destroying a national hero. He looked like he wanted to kill him, and his son was standing there next to him while he did it.</p><p>\"It just shows how crazy the fans can get in this country. I love that there's a tradition, history and passion around the sport. But I can't understand why a full stadium would chant homophobic slurs when Brighton come into town. It's 2013, gay people can get married in the UK. It's a great place to live. But football is sometimes left in the Stone Age. It's so far behind.\"</p><p>Initiatives such as Beyond \"it\" may help in time, and their partnership with Leeds is innovative and impressive. For Rogers, the closed season has been frantic, taking in whistle-stop tours of Europe to front the organisation's message. In mid-January he will be back in pre-season in Los Angeles seeking to make his mark after injuries nullified his comeback campaign, limiting him to 11 scoreless appearances.</p><p>There appears little immediate chance to add to his 18 international caps before the World Cup finals. Indeed, there has been no contact with Jürgen Klinsmann since Rogers sent him an email earlier this year confirming his intention to retire. \"I've known Jürgen since I was 14, but I haven't spoken to him. So I don't even know what his plans are, or how he feels about everything. But it's been two years since I played for the national team, so it would be unrealistic to consider Brazil. In truth, I'm just looking forward to my first full season back.</p><p>\"There have been times this year when I've been trying to get over injuries and I've been overwhelmed by what I've taken on. The mental roller-coaster I've been on had taken a toll on my body. But the importance of what I'm doing, or Jason Collins is doing, or Tom Daley is doing … it's not a sacrifice, but it's something you have to do. To look at the bigger picture. Eventually, we won't have to talk about it because it will be accepted. That has to be the ideal: that it's no longer an issue at all.\"</p><p></p><p><em>Robbie Rogers launches his </em><a href=\"http://www.beyondit.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Beyond \"it\" campaign</em></a><em> in the UK this week in partnership with Leeds United.

        "body":"<p>Graeme Swann's Facebook exchange with his brother after England lost the third Test to Australia has prompted outrage after the spinner compared the Ashes defeat to being \"arse raped\".</p><p>He posted the comment in response to his brother Alec posting that he had enjoyed a night out seeing the band Shed Seven at Northampton's Roadmender venue. \"Rather have been there than being arse raped in Perth!\" Swann replied.</p><p>His message soon reached the public domain and sparked condemnation from rape charities, which called the Nottinghamshire player's actions appalling and demanded an apology. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swannyg66/status/413478459373936640\">Swann later tweeted</a>: \"Sorry to anyone who was offended by my comments in the papers today. Crass and thoughtless of me in the extreme.\"</p><p>Yvonne Traynor, the chief executive of Rape Crisis, told the Daily Telegraph: \"We are appalled that Graeme Swann equates a cricket match with the devastatingly serious crime of rape. It is the duty of a people in the public eye to make sure that their own distorted views are kept to themselves and not shared with the general public. These comments lack compassion and intelligence and he should apologise to anyone who has suffered from this heinous crime.\"</p><p>Swann has had a poor series in Australia, taking only seven wickets in three defeats, and he had a particularly bad game in Perth, where he was hit for 22 in an over by Shane Watson. That prompted the former England captain Bob Willis to call for him to be dropped.</p><p>The Australian fast bowler Ryan  Harris apologised for a drunken rant  on Twitter after being refused entry  to a party as he celebrated his side's  Ashes success.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425341503|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|a0fba4708e1bc26eb8ebf7eaa2ee9642ba8fc128 -->",

Yet that measure does not capture all the tax government should be collecting. For instance, this figure does not include all the tax revenue lost to aggressive tax avoidance schemes.</p><p>\"HMRC holds back from using the full range of sanctions at its disposal. It pursues tax owed by the smaller businesses but seems to lose its nerve when it comes to mounting prosecutions against multinational corporations.</p><p>\"It predicted that it would collect £3.12bn unpaid tax from UK holders of Swiss bank accounts and this figure was built into budget estimates, but in 2013-14 it has so far secured just £440m. We were astonished that HMRC could not give any reasons for such a shortfall.\"</p><p>The report said HMRC needed to show that it was dealing \"robustly\" with individuals and companies who deliberately mislead it. It noted that just one individual out of 16 identified targets on the so-called Lagarde list of Swiss account holders with potential UK tax liabilities had been successfully prosecuted.</p><p>The lack of prosecutions against multinational corporations seemed at odds with HMRC's stance on pursuing tax debt from small- and medium-sized businesses in the UK, the committee noted.</p><p>In a reference to widespread criticism of tax arrangements at Amazon and Google, the committee pointed out that tax officials have yet to test how existing tax law impacts on global internet-based companies.</p><p>The findings were rejected by HMRC, which accused the committee of \"selective and misleading use of figures\", particularly when calcuating the tax gap. A spokesman said MPs had highlighted the increase in money which had not been collected instead of calculating a percentage of uncollected tax, which has actually gone down.</p><p>\"HMRC seeks to collect the tax that is due from all taxpayers, so that everyone pays their fair share in accordance with the tax laws passed by parliament.</p><p>\"We have secured more than £50bn of additional tax from our compliance work since 2010, including £23bn from large businesses,\" he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Vodafone revealed that its direct contribution to the UK from taxation dropped 18.6% to £275m in the year 2012-2013 from £338m a year before. The figure includes corporation tax as well as business rates, employers' national insurance and many other items.</p><p>Vodafone said it paid \"little or no corporation tax\" in Britain because its profits in the UK were relatively small at less than £300m and were dwarfed by capital spending of more than £1bn on its UK network and interest costs in excess of £600m paid to British banks.</p><p>The company set out the tax it paid in 27 countries compared with a year earlier in unusual detail for a British company. Its biggest direct tax bill was in Turkey, where it paid £454m. Vodafone said it wanted to be open about the tax it paid after it was attacked over its contribution in the UK.</p><p>The company said: \"As the UK government wants more investment in UK infrastructure and jobs, it allows all businesses to claim relief for the cost of assets used in the business against their profits when determining their corporation tax bills.</p><p>\"The government also provides relief to all businesses for the cost of interest on their debts to UK banks and financial institutions. Vodafone is no different to any other UK business.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425341626|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|aa0b0812f1229d0d8d040db2a8cb11eca833bb0b -->",

        "headline":"Obama review panel: strip NSA of power to collect phone data records",
        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency should be banned from attempting to undermine the security of the internet and stripped of its power to collect telephone records in bulk, a White House review panel recommended on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/dec/18/nsa-review-panel-report-document\">In a 300-page report</a> prepared for President Obama, the panel made 46 recommendations, including that the authority for spying on foreign leaders should be granted at a higher level than at present.</p> <p>Though far less sweeping than campaigners have urged, and yet to be ratified by Obama, the report by his Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology comes as the White House faces growing pressure over its so-called &ldquo;bulk collection&rdquo; programs from US courts and business interests.</p> <p>Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that the bulk collection program, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">first revealed by the Guardian in June</a> through a court order against Verizon, was likely to be in violation of the US constitution, describing it as &ldquo;almost Orwellian&rdquo; in scope.&nbsp;</p> <p>The White House was stung into releasing the report weeks earlier than expected after meeting America&rsquo;s largest internet companies on Tuesday. The firms warned that failure to rebuild public trust in communications privacy could damage the US economy.</p> <p>In its report, the review panel, led by former security officials and academics including the husband of one of Obama's top advisers, said the NSA should be removed of its power to collect the metadata of Americans' phone calls. Instead, it suggested that private companies such as phone carriers retain their customer records in a format that the NSA can access on demand.</p> <p>This is likely to anger the intelligence community, which argues for direct access, but also fall foul of telephone companies, who have privately warned those drafting more ambitious reforms in Congress that such a scheme would be impractical and dangerous.</p> <p>&ldquo;In our view, the current storage by the government of bulk metadata creates potential risks to public trust, personal privacy, and civil liberty,&rdquo; says the report. &ldquo;The government should not be permitted to collect and store mass, undigested, non-public personal information about US persons for the purpose of enabling future queries and data-mining for foreign intelligence purposes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Despite revelations that the NSA tapped the phones of world leaders such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/angela-merkel-nsa-snooping-serious\">Germany&rsquo;s Angela Merkel</a>, the report proposes only minimal overseas reforms, merely requiring higher clearance to &ldquo;identify both the uses and the limits of surveillance on foreign leaders and in foreign nations.&rdquo;</p> <p>On the security of the internet, the report says the US government should not \"undermine efforts to create encryption standards\" and not \"subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable\" commercial security software.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security\">NSA documents published by the Guardian in September</a> revealed how the agency had used its central role in setting encryption standards to install backdoor flaws to intercept private traffic, causing a storm of protest among internet companies.</p> <p>But the report does little to address a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\">string other privacy breaches </a>revealed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, and several of its recommendations deal with tighter vetting requirements for staff and contractors with access to sensitive information, designed to prevent future leaks.</p> <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the privacy advocates suing the Obama administration over the bulk surveillance, expressed disappointment with the review group report. &ldquo;The review board floats a number of interesting reform proposals, and we're especially happy to see them condemn the NSA's attacks on encryption and other security systems people rely upon,&rdquo; attorney Kurt Opsahl said.</p> <p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re disappointed that the recommendations suggest a path to continue untargeted spying. Mass surveillance is still heinous, even if private company servers are holding the data instead of government data centers.&rdquo;</p> <p>After meeting the report&rsquo;s authors on Wednesday, the White House said Obama would be taking a copy with him to read over Christmas and would decide which recommendations to accept before delivering his state of the union address on January 28.</p> <p>&ldquo;It's an extremely dense and substantive exercise, which is why, in response to a 300-plus page report with 46 recommendations, we are not going to come out with an assessment five minutes later,&rdquo; said spokesman Jay Carney.</p> <p>Carney acknowledged there was &ldquo;no question&rdquo; that the Snowden disclosures had helped lead to the review process and &ldquo;heightened focus here at the White House and more broadly in the administration, around the United States and the globe.&rdquo;</p> <p>For months, the NSA, the phone companies and reform-minded legislators have doubted the viability of having the phone companies store call data on the NSA's behalf.</p> <p>The NSA has pointed to cumbersome and varied file formats that prevent analysts from quickly searching through the companies' data troves, particularly those proprietary to the telecos. They have also fretted that the companies only keep customer data for 18 months, while they argue they need a historical database of every domestic call going back as few as three years and as many as five.</p> <p>The companies themselves fear expensive legal and technical morasses that mass data storage on behalf of the NSA may portend.</p> <p>Meanwhile, civil libertarians and reform-minded legislators believe the databases themselves are problematic. Having the phone companies store them, to provide access to the NSA, is insufficient, they believe.</p> <p>&ldquo;Bulk collection of personal data should simply end,&rdquo; said Alan Butler, an attorney for the Electronic Privacy Information Center.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the legislators behind the USA Freedom Act, the major legislative vehicle before the House and Senate to end NSA domestic bulk call data collection, will be satisfied with the proposal. But at least one member of the House intelligence committee who has sided with the reformers, California Democrat Adam Schiff, called it a &ldquo;very positive step&rdquo; and urged Obama to get out in front of the coming swell of legislation.</p> <p>&ldquo;With the strong likelihood of congressional action, as well as a recent adverse decision by a federal district court judge, I believe the president would be well served to take the advice of the board and restructure the program as soon as possible. It would be better to have this undertaken in an orderly and expeditious fashion, than to wait for it to be compelled by the Congress or the courts,&rdquo; Schiff said on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p> <p>The White House has said Obama will not decide on which of the panel&rsquo;s reforms to implement until the new year. But last week, the administration decided against one of its recommendations, that would split the NSA from the US military&rsquo;s Cyber Command.</p> <p>The decision was reached, White House officials said, because Cyber Command&rsquo;s task of protecting US military networks from hostile attack and launching wartime online counter-attacks is too ambitious for Cyber Command, which only became operational in 2010.&nbsp;</p> <p>Accordingly, the NSA director will remain a military general or admiral, contradicting the review group&rsquo;s recommendation that a civilian should take the helm of the world&rsquo;s largest spy agency.</p> <p>Civil libertarian groups have been skeptical of the report for months, fearing that the White House established the insider panel to give Obama and the NSA cover to implement merely cosmetic changes. Advisers to the panel have told the Guardian since September that the panel was stopping well short of meaningful privacy reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>As late as Sunday, White House officials told reporters that the report would not be released until January. But in the days since, the NSA and the Obama administration have been buffeted by criticism, from a widely ridiculed 60 Minutes documentary on the NSA, to Judge Richard Leon&rsquo;s scathing ruling, to the tech giants&rsquo; impatience with the surveillance agency.</p> <p>The report&rsquo;s authors were Richard Clarke, a former US cybersecurity adviser; Michael Morell, a former deputy CIA director; Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor; Peter Swire, who served earlier on Obama's national economic council; and Cass Sunstein, a Harvard law school professor who is married to UN ambassador Samantha Power.</p> <p>Just before the White House released the review's report, a different group advising Obama, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which has held public hearings into the NSA for months, announced it will release two studies of its own, one into bulk collection of domestic phone data and the other into bulk foreign communications collection.</p> <p>The reviews, due around late January and early February 2014, will also assess the operations of the secret Fisa court overseeing surveillance and provide \"recommendations for legislative and program changes,\" the board announced on Wednesday afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425322038|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|d9867cea13a7480609ed05593fcbe6ae2bdd3cd7 -->",

De Boer would be loth to leave Ajax before the end of the season, as they chase a fourth consecutive league title, and many of Tottenham's other targets are in similar situations. Sherwood, though, admitted that his club have to act decisively.</p><p>\"The players are professional enough to get on with it and I've just tried to steady the ship,\" Sherwood said after his team blew a lead by conceding twice in the last 10 minutes. \"There's obviously upheaval when your manager leaves … you've been used to him and his voice. It's a new voice now. It would be good to get it resolved for the football club's sake and the players'.\"</p><p>Sherwood said he took a call from the chairman, Daniel Levy, on Monday at 10.15am and it set in motion what has been a whirlwind few days. \"He asked me to take the first-team training, which I did, and here we are now,\" Sherwood said. \"The future beyond that … I need to have a chat with the chairman and see what they're thinking. I don't know, to be honest. The immediate future is up in the air, that's as much as I know. Do I know about Southampton? No.</p><p>\"It's been different. It's madness, really. I'm not used to sleeping two hours at night. I'm waking up thinking about footballers. I said the other day, I slept like a baby – I woke up crying four times in the middle of the night.</p><p>\"I'm up for a challenge, I always have been. I'm very opinionated. I know a certain way that I need to play. I think I can manage men, deal with them, be honest with them. The decision that's going on is out of my hands unfortunately. I've got to be in the frame but it's not my decision.\"</p><p>Sherwood changed the team's style from that of Villas-Boas, playing with two strikers and a higher tempo. But they flagged in the final 20 minutes which, in part, allowed West Ham to come back to win. Sherwood suggested the players were not fit enough to play in that style.</p><p>\"I think, to be honest, they ran out of a bit of steam,\" he said. \"I think they are fit enough to play a certain way but I wanted to change the way we wanted to play.</p><p>\"The problem we had was giving the ball away. There was a period after we scored [in the 67th minute] when we were turning over possession and it's impossible to rest when you are out of possession. You need to rest on the ball and they need to recognise when is the right time to do that. I don't think they did that well enough, and that encouraged West Ham.</p><p>\"I think they are fit enough but to play a certain way … When it's a complete change of mindset of how I asked them to play – I asked them to go a bit more gung-ho, and up and at them. You need to acclimatise to that.\"</p><p>Sherwood described the defeat as a major disappointment and said that everybody in the dressing room was \"sick\". But for Sam Allardyce and West Ham, it was a night of glory, with his side's two late goals setting up a semi-final against Manchester City. They had won at White Hart Lane in the Premier League on 6 October.</p><p>\"It's a brilliant effort from the squad and a great night for the fans,\" Allardyce said. \"It's twice on the trot now and I know how much it means to them. It was a case of exploiting the spaces Tottenham left when they got 1-0 up.</p><p>\"I thought they might have sat back and protected that, but they didn't. They went for the second …  and we started exploiting the spaces that were left.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425344952|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|f1ce987aeaaa0edc4b69acdb6a28db244d4cd4cd -->",

        "body":"<p>Sir Alex Ferguson has always been a keen racing fan. You'll know that, particularly if you read his latest memoir and noticed the passing mention of the seismic and decidedly ill-advised row over champion stallion Rock of Gibraltar in which he became embroiled with his former employers John Magnier and JP McManus. Yesterday a slightly less controversial beast named I'm Fraam Govan, which Ferguson actually does own, won the former Manchester United manager a prize pot worth £60,000 at Kempton Park, getting his head in front over 11 furlongs under a fine hold-up ride from his jockey Jim Crowley. The only surprise? That in the wake of his slightly awkward appearance in the guard of honour for Ferguson at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, Ferguson's forelock-tugging successor David Moyes was not on hand to lead the horse in to the winner's enclosure on behalf of his master.</p><p>The Rumour Mill jests of course, as Moyes was otherwise engaged masterminding his greatest football triumph to date: passing the acid test of football management that is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/18/stoke-city-manchester-united-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">victory for a visiting team at the Britannia Stadium on as filthy, dirty, wet and windy a Wednesday night at Stoke as you're ever likely to see</a>. Despite fielding a team comprised largely of reserves, Moyes still chose not to give <strong>Wilfried Zaha</strong> a run out, a state of affairs that suggests the winger will almost certainly feeling that he has no option to go out on loan if he wants to play football on a regular basis this season. With - deep breath - Newcastle, Swansea City, West Ham, West Brom and Aston Villa believed to be among up to 10 clubs who fancy signing up Zaha in January, Moyes is likely to spend an hour or two studying the fixture list in a bid to figure out which interested party is most likely to take the most points off his main rivals.</p><p>With Atletico Madrid joint top of the Spanish League and having been handed an eminently winnable Champions League last 16 draw against the worst Milan team the Rumour Mill has ever seen, their in-form striker <strong>Diego Costa</strong> is unlikely to want to leave the Vicente Calderon any time soon. This won't stop Arsenal trying to sign the 25-year-old Brazilian who has scored 22 goals already this season; the Premier League leaders are believed to be interested in triggering the £32m release clause in his contract once the January transfer window inches open and have already opened negotiations with the player's \"people\". Costa's is believed to be one name on a five-man shortlist of strikers drawn up by Arsenal, the others being Juventus striker <strong>Fernando Llorente</strong>, AC Milan's<strong> Stephan El Shaarawy, </strong>Borussia Dortmund's <strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong> and Paris Saint-Germain's <strong>Ezequiel Lavezzi</strong>.</p><p>The Daily Mirror reports that <strong>Iker Casillas</strong> is being touted around the upper echelons of the Premier League, where both Arsenal and Manchester City have been approached by shifty Arthur Daly types enquiring if they'd be interested in buying a 32-year-old Spanish goalkeeper with one careful owner and about 630 appearances for club and country on the clock.</p><p>The Mirror also reports that Manchester City midfielder <strong>Abdisalam Ibrahim</strong> is wanted by Swansea, Reading and Queens Park Rangers. The 22-year-old spent the first part of this season on loan at Norwegian side Strømsgodset, who he helped win the Tippeligaen, the country's equivalent of the Premier League. Crystal Palace and Everton have been linked with Ibrahim in the past, while he is also believed to have turned heads in France and Italy.</p><p>In news that will come as no surprise to regular readers of the Rumour Mill, assorted newspapers continue to report that Real Madrid are planning a summer move for <strong>Luis Suárez</strong>, while Seattle Sounders striker <strong>Clint Dempsey </strong>is about to return to Fulham on loan. Meanwhile in Italy, Inter centre-back <strong>Andrea Ranocchi </strong>is set to usurp St Francis as Assisi's favourite local celebrity, with Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal all interested in bringing him to England.</p><p>The Irish Independent reveals that <strong>Aiden McGeady</strong>'s January move to Everton is advancing full steam ahead, although Hull City, Newcastle and Aston Villa are also sniffing around the Spartak Moscow winger, whose contract expires next summer. McGeady was suspended in late November for apparently failing to heed his manager's instructions and is believed to be anxious to leave the Russian club sooner rather than later.</p><p>And finally, Juventus and Inter both like the cut of Manchester City defender <strong>Aleksandar Kolarov</strong>'s jib, while Tottenham want to install Ajax boss <strong>Frank De Boer</strong> as their new manager. <strong>André Villas-Boas</strong> is a surprise contender for the vacant manager's position at West Brom.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425363731|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|d8a7930a7b5416ec41493b90318d9d4bb9c4b529 -->",

        "headline":"Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen: masters of the selfie",
        "body":"<p>Patrick Stewart has unleashed the latest image to send the internet into fits of cooing: a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/413352995297189888\">picture</a> of him and Ian McKellen sat on Santa's lap. Each are sporting Christmas jumpers – one red, one green – but are also wearing the bowler hats from their characters in Waiting For Godot that they're currently playing in New York, creating the most dissonant blend of high and low art since Twin Peaks. Words like \"adorable\" are being bandied about with a frequency usually reserved for baby showers.</p><p>It's all part of a merciless assault on the meme-osphere that McKellen and Stewart have calibrated with the power of their X-Men alter egos. They've been doing equally bromantic selfies in front of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/410902017138515968\">a Christmas tree</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/406191641297698816\">carving a turkey on Thanksgiving</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/400684079416635393\">hanging out by the Wall Steet bull</a> (with McKellen wearing a particularly swagged-out jacket), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/390514596685307904\">getting boozed</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/400118216296759297\">bumping into</a> the God of funk and Twitter, Questlove.</p><p>This is just the most recent image dump – their recent trip to do <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/sir-patrick-stewart-narrowly-misses-bullseye-archery-photos-article-1.1432386\">some archery lessons</a> was equally adorable, and Stewart chalked the high water mark of selfies with his picture of himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/395960502083276801\">dressed as a lobster in a bathtub</a> for Halloween.</p><p>Why does this reduce the twitterati to jelly? The pair have built up an underground vault of goodwill and credibility from often very serious work – judiciously sprinkled with mainstream roles (Gandalf, Picard) that have cult fanboys gathering at their feet while their profiles also more generally rise. Now they're cashing in that sizable cultural capital, and their sudden immediacy and \"realness\" has everything clapping along in bewildered glee – so much so that their quite blatant viral marketing for their play is rendered entirely charming, even subliminal.</p><p>The pair also shamelessly play up to the version of \"Briddishness\" that Americans love: stentorian, even domineering, but also rather camp and twinkly. They explode everything Americans assume about us – that we're hopelessly repressed grumps – and everyone delights into the apparent unlikeliness of British people having fun and being silly (see also Monty Python). Where so often the British fetishise Hollywood success from one of our own, it's a reminder that Americans fetishise us: our supposed worldliness, class and heritage.</p><p>And while even the horniest schoolboy is getting jaded at yet another Kim Kardashian bum selfie (bumfie?), the thesp-love of these two is just so endearing that it'll probably never get old. We await the inevitable McKellen Easter Bunny costume with bated breath.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425359529|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|df1ebd891d8d92548145b4eb368a4004c4c0ac61 -->",

        "body":"<p>Who could forget, back in 2009, the launch of the \"Best Job in the World\"? </p><p>The campaign by Tourism Queensland generated global interest in the Sunshine State and the role of park ranger and \"caretaker\" of Hamilton Island in the Great Barrier Reef. Ben Southall was the inaugural winner, a Brit by birth and native of Hampshire, he beat 35,000 applicants for the coveted role.</p><p>Ben spent a year promoting the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. In the first four days, he visited the pristine Whitehaven Beach, stopped for lunch at Hayman Island, went on a tour of the Coral Sea and Daydream Island and ended up at the Seaworld adventure park and a game of Aussie Rules (Richmond vs Adelaide - Go Crows!).</p><p>Four days into his year-long stint in the Best Job in the World, <a href=\"http://blog.queensland.com/2009/07/07/did-i-really-do-that-much-in-just-4-days/\">Ben said</a>: \"My stay on the Gold Coast has been nothing short of spectacular; there really is something for everybody.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, soon a massively destructive coal port will be built just 50 km north of the magnificent Whitsunday Islands. The port expansion was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/greg-hunt-approves-dredging-off-queensland-to-create-huge-coalport\">approved by the Abbott Liberal National government on Wednesday 11 December</a>, and it will become one of the world's largest coal ports.</p><p>The coal export facility is ironically located on Abbot Point. The construction of this port will involve dredging 3 million cubic metres of seabed. The dredge spoil will be dumped into the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.</p><p>To give you an idea of the scale of this dredging, if all of the spoil was put into dump trucks, there would be 150,000 of them lined up bumper to bumper from Brisbane to Melbourne.</p><p>This expansion is further proof that the Abbott government is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2013/nov/17/tony-abbott-climate-denier-coal-socialism\">hell-bent on turning Australia into a reckless charco-state</a> that solely represents the interests of fossil fuel and coal companies.</p><p>Just around the corner from the port is a beach that is the nesting place for endangered green and flat back turtles. Fun <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/flatback-turtle-natator-depressus-0\">facts about the flat back turtle</a>: they're officially classified as \"vulnerable\" by the Australian Government, and nest only in northern Australia. They have the smallest migratory range of any marine turtle, so when their home in Queensland is destroyed, they've really got nowhere else to go.</p><p>Also in the spoil-dumping area are sea-grass beds, which are the home to dugongs. The \"sea cows\" may not be the sexiest of marine animals, but they are at risk of extinction, and most of the world's remaining population lives in the Great Barrier Reef. This is <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.au/our_work/saving_the_natural_world/wildlife_and_habitats/australian_priority_species/dugongs/about_dugongs/dugongs_in_australian_waters/\">one of the reasons</a> that the Reef has World Heritage listing.</p><p>An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/15/dredging-report-queensland-barrier-reef\">independent government report</a> from August this year found that dredging sediment travelled a lot further than previously thought. The risks include sediment being disturbed by severe weather. Even a cursory look at Queensland's <a href=\"http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/outlook-for-the-reef/extreme-weather/ecosystem-impacts/impact-on-coral-reefs\">weather patterns near the Reef</a> over the past decade would show that severe weather, including tropical cyclones and flooding, is a regular occurrence, even if you <a href=\"http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/media-room/latest-news/climate-change/2011/cyclone-yasi-impacts-on-the-great-barrier-reef-assessed\">disregard massively destructive events like Cyclone Yasi</a>.</p><p>The Great Barrier Reef generated around 69,000 full-time equivalent jobs, and boosted our economy by 5.68 billion in 2011/12, according to <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/economic-contribution-great-barrier-reef-march-2013\">recent research</a>. Most of this is through tourism and reef-dependent industries like fishing.</p><p>Environment Minister Greg Hunt has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/greg-hunt-approves-dredging-off-queensland-to-create-huge-coalport\">mischievously claimed</a> that \"Some of the strictest conditions in Australian history have been placed on these projects\". This is mischievous because, obviously, massively increasing coal exports at this time will do irreparable damage to our climate.</p><p>Worryingly, Greg Hunt's briefing and decision, released on the 11th of December, is based on the assurance of the North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation, the state-owned corporation that owns the project, that \"the project area (dredging area) is not a notable or significant biodiversity site in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area\" and \"the potential impact area in the dumping ground (which is within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) is considerably small\". The brief also says that the \"habitats were recorded to recover from similar events\".</p><p>You are obviously free to come to your own views about Hunt's strange cognitive dissonance, where on the one hand there are the \"strictest conditions\" on the dredging, but on the other hand the \"dredging area is not a notable... site\" in the Reef. Perhaps someone could leave a comment that explains why Hunt has required strict conditions if the area is not a significant site.</p><p>Unless of course, Hunt is simply trying to pull the wool over our eyes. You be the judge.</p><p>The very real problems are not just the vast and untold damage that dredging will do to the Great Barrier Reef, or the risk of damage to the reef by the substantial increase in shipping through the World Heritage Area.</p><p>The Abbot Point development has been green-lit to funnel vast amounts of coal out of Australia. The coal ports currently proposed, including Abbot Point and new coal terminals proposed at Wiggins Island, Raglan Creek, Balaclava Island, Dudgeon Point, and Cape York, would increase total coal tonnage by more than six-fold, from 156 Mt in 2011 to a capacity of 944 Mt by the end of the decade.</p><p>Australia's coal is one of the globe's fourteen carbon bombs. Our coal export industry is the largest in the world, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/22/china-australia-carbon-bomb\">results in 760m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions annually</a>. The urgent goal of Tony Abbott's government, and his environment minister Greg Hunt is to ship as much climate-devastating coal as possible, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Every day, this Liberal-National government, led by Tony Abbott, provides new examples of its nastiness, its short-sightedness, and its willingness to destroy livelihoods, communities and the environment to enrich coal barons.</p><p>You can do something.</p><p>Retweet this tweet:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Hey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregHuntMP\">@GregHuntMP</a>, don't destroy the Great Barrier Reef. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23savethereef&amp;src=hash\">#savethereef</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23auspol&amp;src=hash\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/Sh89HXI0Sf\">pic.twitter.com/Sh89HXI0Sf</a></p><p>&mdash; Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexanderwhite/statuses/411822635216289792\">December 14, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>Visit this website and <a href=\"http://fightforthereef.org.au/\">fight for the Reef</a>.</p><p>Send <a href=\"http://www.action.org.au/protecting-our-environment\">Greg Hunt an email</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425013457|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|8de8bb0c2ac1dc8e48f6e2b5a44b9dd9e8249c77 -->",

At least one member of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences' music selection committee has reportedly received \"an anonymous envelope\" with what looks like a print-out from the industry magazine Variety. The article, which was never actually published, claims that Lana Del Rey's song has been disqualified due to a release date technicality. Studio and label representatives were unable to trace the enevelope's sender.</p><p> Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/lana-del-rey/young-and-beautiful-music-video/1897118/\">Click here to watch</a></p><p>Smear campaigns are not unknown during Academy Awards season: as <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5840339/lana-del-rey-best-song-oscar-bid-sabotaged\">Billboard points out</a>, in 2004, a rumour circulated that Kathleen \"Bird\" York's song In The Deep was already several years old when it appeared on the soundtrack for Crash.

Maybe it's not even true. I have no idea where that rumour originated.\"</p><p>Warner Bros, the studio that released The Great Gatsby, is apparently gearing-up its counter-offensive. They are currently putting the finishing touches on an online featurette which will highlight the song and its strong relationship to the film, as well as reminding jurors that Del Rey is absolutely eligible for her first Oscar.</p><p>Young And Beautiful is one of five Great Gatsby songs to be longlisted for the 86th Academy Awards.

        "headline":"Should newspapers ban climate deniers like Reddit's science forum?",
        "body":"<p>In addition to my career as a PhD chemist, I am one of a select few who enjoy the privilege of moderating content on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reddit.com/\">reddit.com</a>&rsquo;s science forum. The science forum is a small part of reddit, but it nonetheless enjoys over 4 million subscribers. By comparison, that&rsquo;s roughly twice the circulation of&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>.</p> <p>The forum, known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/science\">/r/science,</a>&nbsp;provides a digital space for discussions about recent, peer-reviewed scientific publications. This puts us (along with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience\">/r/AskScience</a>) on the front line of the science-public interface. On our little page, scientists and nonscientists can connect through discussions on everything from subatomic particles to interstellar astrophysics.</p> <p>As a moderator of this discussion, I&rsquo;ve observed scientific discourse across a wide variety of disciplines. I consider it a microcosm, representative of the vast range of views that can be supported by empirical evidence. Importantly, it provides the same window for those who are not scientists, who do not regularly talk with PhDs, and who may be unfamiliar with how science is discussed by scientists. In essence, it is a window into the Ivory Tower.</p> <p>Given that our users are mainly academics (and all are nerds), the discussion generally resembles any scientific debate. That is, there are always numerous links to peer-reviewed science to support positions, people don&rsquo;t deliberately mislead or misrepresent content, and there is a basic level of respect shared regardless of position. When a user strays from such decorum, they are kindly warned and, if necessary, the comment is removed.</p> <p>Some issues, however, are particularly contentious. While evolution and vaccines do have their detractors, no topic consistently evokes such rude, uninformed, and outspoken opinions as climate change.</p> <p>Instead of the reasoned and civil conversations that arise in most threads, when it came to climate change the comment sections became a battleground. Rather than making thoughtful arguments based on peer-reviewed science to refute man-made climate change, contrarians immediately resorted to aggressive behaviors.&nbsp;On one side, deniers accused any of the hard-working scientists whose research supported and furthered our understanding of man-made climate change of being bought by &ldquo;Big Green.&rdquo; On the other side, deniers were frequently insulted and accused of being paid to comment on reddit by &ldquo;Big Oil.&rdquo;</p> <p>After some time interacting with the regular denier posters, it became clear that they could not or would not improve their demeanor. These problematic users were not the common &ldquo;internet trolls&rdquo; looking to have a little fun upsetting people. Such users are practically the norm on reddit. These people were true believers, blind to the fact that their arguments were hopelessly flawed, the result of cherry-picked data and conspiratorial thinking.&nbsp;They had no idea that the smart-sounding talking points from their preferred climate blog were, even to a casual climate science observer, plainly wrong. They were completely enamored by the emotionally charged and rhetoric-based arguments of pundits on talk radio and Fox News.</p> <p>As a scientist myself, it became clear to me that the contrarians were not capable of providing the science to support their &ldquo;skepticism&rdquo; on climate change. The evidence simply does not exist to justify continued denial that climate change is caused by humans and will be bad. There is always legitimate debate around the cutting edge of research, something we see regularly. But with climate change, science that has been established, constantly tested, and reaffirmed for decades was routinely called into question.</p> <p>Over and over, solid peer-reviewed science was insulted as corrupt, while blog posts from fossil-fuel-funded groups were cited as objective fact. Worst of all, they didn&rsquo;t even get the irony of quoting oil-funded blogs that called university scientists biased.</p> <p>The end result was a disservice to science and to rational exploration, not to mention the scholarly audience we are proud to have cultivated. When&nbsp;<a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article\">97 percent of climate scientists agree that man is changing the climate</a>, we would hope the comments would at least acknowledge if not reflect such widespread consensus.&nbsp;Since that was not the case, we needed more than just an ad hoc approach to correct the situation.</p> <p>The answer was found in the form of proactive moderation. About a year ago, we moderators became increasingly stringent with deniers. When a potentially controversial submission was posted, a warning would be issued stating the rules for comments (most importantly that your comment isn&rsquo;t a conspiracy theory) and advising that further violations of the rules could result in the commenter being banned from the forum.</p> <p>As expected, several users reacted strongly to this. As a site, reddit is passionately dedicated to free speech, so we expected considerable blowback. But the widespread outrage we feared never materialized, and the atmosphere greatly improved.</p> <p>We discovered that the disruptive faction that bombarded climate change posts was actually substantially smaller than it had seemed. Just a small handful of people ran all of the most offensive accounts. What looked like a substantial group of objective skeptics to the outside observer was actually just a few bitter and biased posters with more opinions then evidence.</p> <p>Negating the ability of this misguided group to post to the forum quickly resulted in a change in the culture within the comments. Where once there were personal insults and bitter accusations, there is now discussion of the relevant aspects of the research. Instead of (almost comically) paranoid and delusional conspiracy theories, we have knowledgeable users explaining complicated concepts to non-scientists who are simply interested in understanding the research. While we won&rsquo;t claim /r/science is perfect, users seem happy with the changes made.</p> <p>Like our commenters, professional climate change deniers have an outsized influence&nbsp;in the media and the public. And like our commenters, their rejection of climate science is not based on an accurate understanding of the science but on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/nov/08/climage-change-denial-celebrity-not-science\">political preferences and personality</a>. As moderators responsible for what millions of people see, we felt that to allow a handful of commenters to so purposefully mislead our audience was simply immoral.</p> <p>So if a half-dozen volunteers can keep a page with more than 4 million users from being a microphone for the antiscientific, is it too much to ask for newspapers to police their own editorial pages as proficiently?</p> <p>&bull; Nathan Allen is a PhD chemist for a major chemical company, and the opinions expressed here do not necessarily reflect the position of his company. He also is a volunteer moderator of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/science\">reddit.com/r/science</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/425366045|2013-12-19T13:23:07Z|6b184739558d6cf468c68a79f285cfd9d4c888ad -->",
